Socioeconomic position and SARS-CoV-2 infections: seroepidemiological findings from a German nationwide dynamic cohort,"Hoebel, Jens; Grabka, Markus; Schröder, Carsten; Haller, Sebastian; Neuhauser, Hannelore; Wachtler, Benjamin; Schaade, Lars; Liebig, Stefan; Hövener, Claudia; Zinn, Sabine","<h4>Background</h4> Evidence on the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and infections with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is still limited as most of the available studies are ecological in nature. This is the first German nationwide study to examine differences in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections according to SEP at the individual level. <h4>Methods</h4> The ‘CORONA-MONITORING bundesweit’ (RKI-SOEP) study is a seroepidemiological survey among a dynamic cohort of the German adult population (n=15,122; October 2020 – February 2021). Dried blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and oral-nasal swabs for viral RNA. SEP was measured by education and income. Robust logistic regression was used to examine adjusted associations of SARS-CoV-2 infections with SEP. <h4>Results</h4> 288 participants were seropositive, PCR-positive, or self-reported a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 1.87-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06-3.29) higher among low-educated than highly educated adults. Evidence was weaker for income differences in infections (odds ratio=1.65; 95% CI=0.89-3.05). Highly educated adults had lower odds of undetected infection. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The results indicate an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in low-educated groups. To promote health equity in the pandemic and beyond, social determinants should be addressed more in infection protection and pandemic planning.",2021,,,,,,PPR361495,10.1101/2021.06.21.21259001,,#132351,Hoebel 2021,"",""
Analysis of nucleic acid and antibody detection results for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Chen, Juanjuan; Niu, Zhili; Li, Huan; Tang, Dongling; Zhang, Pingan ","Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid test (NAT) has become the standard method to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, there are still many limitations, especially the problem of the high false negative rate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 NAT and evaluate the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody detection in novel coronavirus infection. Method(s): A total of 10 309 suspected or high-risk cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Hubei, China, were tested for virus NAT by RT-PCR. Among those cases, 762 COVID-19 patients and 143 patients with non-COVID-19 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG during the NAT period were screened. The difference between the two test methods was analyzed using the chi-square test. Result(s): The positive rate of 10309 cases was about 36% (95% CI: 33.39%-39.67%). SARS-CoV-2 was present in various types of specimens, and alveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate [52.38% (95% CI: 31.02-73.74)]. The clinical sensitivity of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG was 77.17% (588/762) and 94.88% (723/762), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 93.71% (134/143) and 90.21% (129/143). The area under the curve (AUC) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and combination of IgG with IgM were equally larger than IgM [0.973 (95% CI: 0.964-0.983) vs 0.930 (95% CI: 0.910-0.949)]. IgG antibody had the highest specificity [100.0% (95% CI: 100.00%-100.00%)] and sensitivity [94.0% (95% CI: 92.45%-95.55%)] when detected alone or in combination with IgM antibody. The total coincidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and SARS-CoV-2 NAT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92.04% (833/905). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2 NAT-negative patients with clinical symptoms and CT imaging features, 29 (85.29%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and 31 (91.76%) were positive for IgG. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 NAT should be considered for many types of specimens, and the combined test of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can make up for the problem of missed NAT in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Viral Respiratory Tract Pathogens During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Celebi, Ozgur; Celebi, Demet","Objective: This study aimed to report viral respiratory pathogens during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., Materials and Methods: Other viral pathogens were identified. COVID-19 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G were detected., Results: Of the 56 samples collected from women, 2 (3.5%) were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whereas 8 (10%) of the 80 samples from men were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The number of respiratory syncytial virus-A-positive cases was 6 (10.7%) in women and 14 (17.5%) in men. Two (3.5%) of the women were positive for parainfluenza-3, and 6 of the men were positive for influenza-B. The number of human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-positive women and men was 6 (10.7%) and 6 (7.5%), respectively. Rhinovirus caused 14.2% and 10% of the cases in men and women, respectively. With a ratio of 10.7% in women and 7.5% in men; SARS-CoV-2, with a ratio of 10% in men and 3.5% in women; influenza-B, with a ratio of 7.5% in men; and parainfluenza-3 and 4, with a ratio of 3.5% in women. SARS-CoV-2 had a mean incidence rate of 7% in men and women. The antibody screening results reveal that antibody formation did not occur in 3 women among the 10 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, and antibody formation occurred in 2 of 7 men. Antibody formation occurred in 5 women (16.6%) and 7 men (20.5%) among the 58 patients who were positive for other respiratory tract pathogens. However, 23 (29.5%) of the blood samples collected from 78 individuals who were negative for the COVID-19 agent and other respiratory tract viral pathogens were positive for the COVID-19 antibody., Conclusion: Because the climate is colder than normal in areas settled at higher altitudes, more than one pathogens act together. In addition, respiratory infections are seen in all seasons. This causes the diseases to be fewer and milder than in other regions. ©Copyright 2021 by the Ataturk University School of Medicine - Available online at www.eurasianjmed.com.",2021,/,The Eurasian journal of medicine,53,2,123-126,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5152/eurasianjmed.2021.20459,34177295,#131674,Celebi 2021,"",""
"SARS-Co-V2 infection in never, former, and current tobacco/nicotine users: a cohort study of 4040 Egyptian healthcare workers.","Mostafa, Aya; El-Sayed, Manal H; El-Meteini, Mahmoud; Saleh, Ayman; Omar, Ashraf; Mansour, Ossama; Girgis, Samia; Hafez, Hala; Kandil, Sahar","BACKGROUND: Smoking negatively impacts COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. Evidence on whether smoking is associated with SARS-Co-V2 infection and having a positive test is scarce, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, where most of the world's billion smokers live. The inconsistency in relevant findings calls for study designs and analyses to account for possible confounders including background characteristics and pre-existing co-morbidities, to disentangle the specific effect of smoking. In healthcare workers (HCWs) the frequency of exposure to COVID-19 cases adds another layer of risk that was not factored in previous studies. We examined the association of HCWs' tobacco/nicotine use (never, former, and current use) with having a positive SARS-Co-V2 test result and symptoms suggestive of infection, accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 4040 healthcare workers with baseline and follow-up screening took place during April-June 2020 in 12 healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt. Data on demographics, tobacco/nicotine use (manufactured or roll-your-own cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and electronic devices), co-morbidities, symptoms, exposures, and SARS-Co-V2 investigations were analyzed. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Overall, 270/4040 (6.7, 95%CI: 5.9-7.5) had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 479 (11.9%) were current and 79 (2.0%) were former tobacco/nicotine users. The proportion of positive tests was 7.0% (243/3482, 95%CI: 6.1-7.8) among never, 5.1% (4/79, 95%CI: 0.1-10.0) among former, and 4.8% (23/479, 95%CI: 2.9-6.7) among current users. HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 test results did not vary significantly by single/multiple or daily/non-daily tobacco/nicotine use. Compared to never users, former users were more likely to self-report a pre-existing medical condition (ORadjusted1.87, 95%CI: 1.05-3.33, p = 0.033), and to experience symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (ORadjusted1.76, 95%CI: 1.07-2.90, p = 0.027). After adjustment, former (ORadjusted0.45, 95%CI: 0.11-1.89, p = 0.273) and current (ORadjusted0.65, 95%CI: 0.38-1.09, p = 0.101) tobacco/nicotine use was not associated with HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 positive test results., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on this association from low- and middle-income countries with high tobacco/nicotine use prevalence. In this HCW cohort, having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was not associated with tobacco/nicotine use after accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities. Additional population-based studies could use such preliminary evidence to investigate this controversial association.",2021,/,BMC public health,21,1,1243,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11290-x,34182960,#131844,Mostafa 2021,"",""
Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Following an Outbreak Among Marine Recruits With Asymptomatic or Mild Infection,"Ramos, Irene; Soares-Schanoski, Alessandra; Ge, Yongchao; Vangeti, Sindhu; Marjanovic, Nada; George, Mary-Catherine; Nair, Venugopalan D.; Smith, Gregory R.; Sealfon, Stuart C.; Goforth, Carl; Weir, Dawn L.; Pike, Brian L.; Regeimbal, James; Simons, Mark P.; Letizia, Andrew G.; Broder, Christopher C.; Laing, Eric D.; Samuels, Emily C.; Phogat, Shreshta; Meyer, Michelle; Huang, Kai; Pietzsch, Colette A.; Termini, Michael S.; Lizewski, Stephen; Lizewski, Rhonda; Mao, Weiguang; Chikina, Maria; Bukreyev, Alexander ","We investigated serological responses following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020 on a US Marine recruit training base. 147 participants that were isolated during an outbreak of respiratory illness were enrolled in this study, with visits approximately 6 and 10 weeks post-outbreak (PO). This cohort is comprised of young healthy adults, ages 18-26, with a high rate of asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms, and therefore differs from previously reported longitudinal studies on humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, which often focus on more diverse age populations and worse clinical presentation. 80.9% (119/147) of the participants presented with circulating IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) at 6 weeks PO, of whom 97.3% (111/114) remained positive, with significantly decreased levels, at 10 weeks PO. Neutralizing activity was detected in all sera from SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive participants tested (n=38) at 6 and 10 weeks PO, without significant loss between time points. IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, S2, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, as well neutralization activity, were generally comparable between those participants that had asymptomatic infection or mild disease. A multiplex assay including S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and related zoonotic and human endemic betacoronaviruses revealed a positive correlation for polyclonal cross-reactivity to S after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, young adults that experienced asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection developed comparable humoral responses, with no decrease in neutralizing activity at least up to 10 weeks after infection.Copyright © 2021, At least a portion of this work is authored by Carl Goforth, Dawn L.

Plasma donors (n=101) were followed with sequential samples over 11 months post-symptom onset., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples using Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays over time. UK-RTC AbC-19 LFIA sensitivity and specificity, estimated using a three-reference standard system to establish a characterised panel of 330 positive and 488 negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG samples., RESULTS: We detected persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies for up to 10 months post-infection, across a minimum of two laboratory immunoassays. On the known positive cohort, the UK-RTC AbC-19 LFIA showed a sensitivity of 97.58% (95.28% to 98.95%) and on known negatives, showed specificity of 99.59% (98.53 % to 99.95%)., CONCLUSIONS: Through comprehensive analysis of a cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting over 46 weeks when assessed by EuroImmun ELISA, providing insight to antibody levels at later time points post-infection.

Long-term monitoring of the development and extinction of IgA and IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Ivanov, Andrei; Semenova, Elena","Despite the great interest of scientific community in the behavior of the human body after contact with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a long-term (more than six months) monitoring of immunological status of Covid-19 patients with varying severity degrees and of the people with a low SARS-CoV-2 viral load is practically absent. The aim of this study is a 9-month monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection immune response development and extinction using quantitative assessment of IgA and IgG levels in the blood of healthy donors living in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and of the patients who have undergone COVID-19. The project involved 180 volunteers of whom 51 persons (28.33%) fell ill with COVID-19 during the observation period. All people who underwent Covid-19 developed a stable humoral immune response but their individual immune status had a number of features. 39.22% (20 of 51 people) of project participants diagnosed with Covid-19 showed an unusual change in plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA levels. Relatively high levels of IgA (ratio ~ 3) after recovery persisted for a long time (more than six months). In one third (17 of 51 people) of Covid-19 patients, the IgA level exceeded the IgG level. IgA antibodies appeared earlier and showed a stronger and more robust response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than IgG. Increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA (ratio from 0.8 to 2.36) throughout the observation period were recorded in 28 of 180 project participants (15.56%) of whom only one person fell ill with Covid-19.

It may however also result from asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or even full-blown but undiagnosed and unregistered cases from which patients recovered at home. Here we present a population screening for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in Polish citizens (N=501) who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected in Wrocław (Lower Silesia) on 15th and 22nd May 2021. Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N=22) or from vaccinated citizens (N=14) served as positive controls. Sera were tested with Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG and IgA (quantitative) that contain specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens: NCP, RBD, Spike S2, E, ACE2, PLPro protein, and antigens for exclusion cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV 229E Np, HCoV NL63 Np. Within the investigated population of healthy individuals who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.3% (262 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.2% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501). These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic.",2021,,,,,,PPR361629,10.1101/2021.06.22.21258711,,#132357,Budziar 2021,"",""
Sars-cov-2 infection detection by pcr and serologic testing in clinical practice,"Murad, Douglas; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Garner, Omai B.; Pillai, Ajaya; Denny, Christopher T. ","Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) can be diagnosed by PCR during acute infection or later in their clinical course by detection of virus-specific antibodies. While in theory complementary, both PCR and serologic tests have practical shortcomings. A retrospective study was performed in order to further define these limitations in a clinical context and to determine how to best utilize these tests in a coherent fashion. A total of 3,075 patients underwent both PCR and serology tests at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in the study period. Among these, 2,731 (89%) had no positive tests at all, 73 (2%) had a positive PCR test and only negative serology tests, 144 (5%) had a positive serology test and only negative PCR tests, and 127 (4%) had positive PCR and serology tests. Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e., PCR positive and serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR-positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. On a quantitative level, the log number of days between symptom onset and PCR test was positively correlated with cycle threshold (CT) values. However, there was no apparent relationship between PCR CT and serologic (arbitrary units per milliliter) results.

SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests for field-based healthcare workers in homeless communities: a mixed-methods exploratory analysis.,"Mosnier, Emilie; Nevissas, Olivia; Loubiere, Sandrine; Mosnier, Marine; Bosetti, Thomas; Bottero, Julie; Roux, Perrine; Monfardini, Elisabetta; Tinland, Aurelie","Objectives: The high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in homeless communities requires adapted prevention strategies for field-based healthcare workers (HCWs). Rapid serological tests (RSTs) could be an invaluable tool for HCWs to control COVID-19 transmission. This study assesses the benefits of RSTs for HCWs in Marseille, France., Study design: Mixed-methods exploratory analysis., Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative and qualitative data, to prospectively analyse acceptability of RSTs, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and prevention behaviours in 106 HCWs from 18 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and health or social institutions in Marseille from June 1 to July 31, 2020. For the qualitative dimension, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 21 HCWs from 7 of 18 NGOs and institutions., Results: Most of the 106 HCWs in the quantitative study reported better prevention measures at work than in their homes. Despite this, the majority reported that they felt unsafe at work in terms of COVID-19 infection risk. SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among the study population was 6.1%. Only four HCWs refused to have an RST. The 21 qualitative interviews highlighted that HCWs were not afraid of RSTs or of any possible stigma associated with a positive serological status, although they were sometimes suspicious about RST validity. Downplaying their risk of infection was a coping strategy to keep both a sense of control and remain motivated at work., Conclusions: RSTs should be adopted as an additional tool in the strategy to protect both HCWs and healthcare service users. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed, especially with the increasing prevalence of vaccination in HCWs. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

All participants completed a 20-item questionnaire on demographic data and COVID-19 risk factors and provided blood samples. Antibody testing was performed using an in-house enzyme immunoassay and microneutralization test., RESULTS: Of the 319 participants, 39 had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Five of them had never experienced any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and only 19 were previously diagnosed with COVID-19. The odds of developing COVID-19 or having corresponding antibodies increased if participants experienced COVID-19 symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-7.5) or reported contact with an infected family member (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.5-11.2). Disease acquisition was not associated with employment in the ICU and involvement in the intubation of or close contact with COVID-19 patients. Of the 19 previously diagnosed participants, 6 did not possess any detectable COVID-19 antibodies., CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers may have undiagnosed COVID-19, and those previously infected may not have long-lasting immunity. Therefore, hospitals must continue to uphold strict infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cases were analyzed for associations between MS characteristics and COVID-19 course and for identifying risk factors for a fatal outcome., RESULTS: Of the 326 patients analyzed, 120 were cases confirmed by real-time PCR, 34 by a serologic test, and 205 were suspected. Sixty-nine patients (21.3%) developed severe infection, 10 (3%) critical, and 7 (2.1%) died. Ambulatory patients were higher in relapsing MS forms, treated with injectables and oral first-line agents, whereas more severe cases were observed in patients on pulsed immunosuppressors and critical cases among patients with no therapy. Severe and critical infections were more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, with progressive MS forms, a longer disease course, and higher disability. Fifteen of 33 patients treated with rituximab were hospitalized. Four deceased patients have progressive MS, 5 were not receiving MS therapy, and 2 were treated (natalizumab and rituximab). Multivariate analysis showed age (OR 1.09, 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) as the only independent risk factor for a fatal outcome., CONCLUSIONS: This study has not demonstrated the presumed critical role of MS therapy in the course of COVID-19 but evidenced that people with MS with advanced age and disease, in progressive course, and those who are more disabled have a higher probability of severe and even fatal disease.

Participants were hospital personnel with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. They provided personal information (including age, sex, occupation, and medical history) and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms. Odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity to IgG antibodies was estimated by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions., Findings: Among 4726 participants, IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 9.6% of the HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among HCWs working on COVID-19 wards (14.1% (11.9-16.5)) compared to other hospital areas at medium (10.7% (7.6-14.6)) or low risk exposure (7.3% (6.4-8.3)). OR for high vs. medium wards risk exposure was 1.42 (0.91-2.22), P = 0.119, and 1.98 (1.55-2.53), P<0.001 for high vs. low wards risk exposure. The same was for true for doctors and nurses (10.1% (9.0-11.3)) compared to other employees at medium (7.1% (4.8-10.0)) or low risk exposure (6.6% (5.0-8.4)). OR for high vs. medium profession risk exposure was 1.37 (0.89-2.11), P = 0.149, and 1.75 (1.28-2.40), P = 0.001 for high vs. low profession risk exposure. Moreover, seropositivity was higher among HCWs who had household exposure to COVID-19 cases compared to those without (18.7% (15.3-22.5) vs. 7.7% (6.9-8.6), OR 2.80 (2.14-3.67), P<0.001)., Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable in up to 10% of HCWs from acute care hospitals in a region with high incidence of COVID-19 in the weeks preceding the study. HCWs with exposure to COVID-19 patients have only a slightly higher absolute risk of seropositivity compared to those without, suggesting that the use of PPE and other measures aiming at reducing nosocomial viral transmission are effective.

Retrospective SARS-CoV-2 IgG screening during the first wave (March-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.,"Bird, Paul William; Sandhu, Kyran; Fletcher, Oliver; Ames, Billy; Toovey, Oliver; Tang, Julian Wei-Tze","During the ""first wave"" of COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (March to June 2020), the city of Leicester was particularly hard hit resulting in re-imposed lockdown measures. Although initial PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was attempted within the community, testing was soon abandoned due to an inability to keep up with demand by local laboratories. It is therefore feasible that undiagnosed transmission of COVID-19 in the community by asymptomatic individuals was a real possibility. Therefore, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing of archived sera from out-patients visiting University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust service was performed to investigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. A total of 1779 sea samples were tested from samples collected between 16th March and 3rd June 2020, of which 202 (11.35%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Positivity was lowest in March (2.54%) at the beginning of the pandemic before peaking in April (17.16%) before decline in May and June (11.16% and 12.68% respectively). This retrospective screening offers some insight into the early patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a sampled community population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prevalence and incidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers in Belgian hospitals before vaccination: a prospective cohort study.,"Mortgat, Laure; Verdonck, Kristien; Hutse, Veronik; Thomas, Isabelle; Barbezange, Cyril; Heyndrickx, Leo; Fischer, Natalie; Vuylsteke, Bea; Kabouche, Ines; Arien, Kevin K; Desombere, Isabelle; Duysburgh, Els","OBJECTIVES: To describe prevalence and incidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Belgian hospital healthcare workers (HCW) in April-December 2020., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Follow-up was originally planned until September and later extended., SETTING: Multicentre study, 17 hospitals., PARTICIPANTS: 50 HCW were randomly selected per hospital. HCW employed beyond the end of the study and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. 850 HCW entered the study in April-May 2020, 673 HCW (79%) attended the September visit and 308 (36%) the December visit., OUTCOME MEASURES: A semiquantitative ELISA was used to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum (Euroimmun) at 10 time points. In seropositive samples, neutralising antibodies were measured using a virus neutralisation test. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swabs. Participant characteristics and the presence of symptoms were collected via an online questionnaire., RESULTS: Among all participants, 80% were women, 60% nurses and 21% physicians. Median age was 40 years. The seroprevalence remained relatively stable from April (7.7% (95% CI: 4.8% to 12.1%) to September (8.2% (95% CI: 5.7% to 11.6%)) and increased thereafter, reaching 19.7% (95% CI: 12.0% to 30.6%) in December 2020. 76 of 778 initially seronegative participants seroconverted during the follow-up (incidence: 205/1000 person-years). Among all seropositive individuals, 118/148 (80%) had a positive neutralisation test, 83/147 (56%) presented or reported a positive RT-qPCR, and 130/147 (88%) reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms at least once. However, only 46/73 (63%) of the seroconverters presented COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the month prior to seroconversion., CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence among hospital HCW was slightly higher than that of the general Belgian population but followed a similar evolution, suggesting that infection prevention and control measures were effective and should be strictly maintained.

Empirical data relying on patients' reports of forgoing health care are scarce. This study investigated Covid-19-related self-reports of forgoing health care in a sample of vulnerable outpatients in Geneva, Switzerland. We collected data from 1167 adult outpatients, including clinically vulnerable patients (with chronic diseases), geriatric patients (involved in a health care network for people aged 60 or older), and socially vulnerable patients (involved in a migrant health program or a mobile outpatient community care center) in June 2020. Data on sociodemographic factors, forgoing health care, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were collected. Of the patients, 38.5% reported forgoing health care. Forgoing health care was more frequent for younger patients, women, patients with a low level of education, and patients with a chronic disease (p <.001). There was no significant association between the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and forgoing health care (p =.983).

We assessed the positivity rates and associated factors using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. A total of 228 paired serum samples (456 samples) were obtained from 228 participants. After baseline sampling, the second sampling was conducted between 11-28 days after the first dose of AZ. Sera were tested using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, including two surrogate virus neutralization tests.

The positive rates and antibody titer of sera obtained between 21-28 days were significantly higher than those obtained between 11-20 days in all five assays. More severe and longer duration of adverse reactions were related to higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. The agreements and correlations among the applied assays were substantial (k=0.73-0.95) and strong (rho=0.83-0.91). A single dose of AZ vaccination led to high positivity rates based on the five assays. Days after vaccination and adverse reactions could help estimate serologic conversions.

To evaluate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) over 6 months in the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul (population 11.3 million), based on 8 serological surveys. Methods. In each survey, 4151 participants in round 1 and 4460 participants in round 2 were randomly sampled from all state regions. We assessed presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a validated lateral flow point-of-care test; we adjusted figures for the time-dependent decay of antibodies. Results. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence increased from 0.03% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.00%, 0.34%; 1 in every 3333 individuals) in mid-April to 1.89% (95% CI = 1.36%, 2.54%; 1 in every 53 individuals) in early September. Prevalence was similar across gender and skin color categories. Older adults were less likely to be infected than younger participants. The proportion of the population who reported leaving home daily increased from 21.4% (95% CI = 20.2%, 22.7%) to 33.2% (95% CI = 31.8%, 34.5%). Conclusions.

Our aim was to detect, by serology, previous SARS-CoV-2 contact in SpA, compared to health care workers (HCW), and healthy controls., Methods: Sera from consecutive patients affected by SpA undergoing cytokine-targeted therapy, HCW and healthy controls from 2015 were analysed through chemiluminescent analytical system for the presence of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2. Positive patients (IgM or IgG, or both) additionally underwent real-time Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) to test for active infection. Serology was repeated at 3-months in SpA. Data across 3 groups were compared by Kruskal Wallis/Chi-square, and between 2 groups by Wilcoxon rank test/Chi-Square. P <= 0.05 were considered significant., Results: 200 SpA, 95 HCW and 101 controls were recruited. Positive serology was found in 25(12.5%) SpA, 8(8.4%) HCW, 0(0%) controls (p=0.001). SpA patients with positive serology more frequently reported COVID-19-like symptoms than those with negative serology (20% vs. 4%, p=0.009) and 2 had COVID-19 as confirmed by RT-PCR, non severe. No HCW reported symptoms or had positive RT-PCR. In SpA patients, at 3 months, mean IgM titres decreased from 2.76 +/- 2.93 to 2.38 +/- 2.95 (p=0.001), while IgG titres from 0.89 +/- 3.25 to 0.31 +/- 0.87 (p=ns)., Conclusions: Serology revealed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in SpA patients and HCW was higher than expected based on reported symptoms. In SpA, anti-cytokine therapy could act as a protective factor for a severe disease course. However, a seroconversion was not observed at 3-months.

","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 165 million COVID-19 cases and >3.4 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we conducted a serological study to investigate the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility. Method(s): Extreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated between April and June 2020 for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finding(s): Fifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score >=5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response.

Method(s): The target population was all Iranian people aged 6 years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28 314 people from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias and sampling design. Result(s): Of the 28 314 Iranians selected, 11 256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until 20 August 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval 13.3%-15.2%), which was equal to 11 958 346 (95% CI 11 211 011-12 746 776) individuals. The adjusted prevalences of infection were 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7% and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population and individuals aged 60 years or more, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence and Alborz, Hormozgan and Kerman provinces had the lowest. Conclusion(s): Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19.

Overall, about 10,000 individuals were tested; seropositive subjects were retested after 5 months to evaluate antibodies waning. Among 8769 hospital workers, seroprevalence was 7.6%, without significant differences related to job profile; among 1185 University workers, 3.3%. Self-reporting of COVID-19 suspected symptoms was significantly associated with positivity (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.07, 95%CI: 1.76-2.44), although 27% of seropositive subjects reported no previous symptom. At mul-tivariable analysis, contacts at work resulted in an increased risk of 69%, or 24% for working in a COVID ward; contacts in the household evidenced the highest risk, up to more than five-fold (OR 5.31, 95%CI: 4.12-6.85). Compared to never smokers, being active smokers was inversely associated with seroprevalence (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76). After 5 months, 85% of previously positive subjects still tested positive. The frequency of SARS-COV-2 infection among Health Care Workers was comparable with that observed in surveys performed in Northern Italy and Europe after the first pandemic wave.

Taiwan has been successful in countering the COVID-19 outbreak, however, the potential risk for asymptomatic infections and the prevalence rates remain unknown. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan via serologically testing hospital patients with neither symptoms indicative of nor positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection., Methods: Residual specimens from laboratory blood tests for outpatient and emergency department patients visiting a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan, within one week in May and another in July, 2020, were collected. We used Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Assay to screen and further validated cases with high cutoff index by a confirmatory ELISA assay. We also analysed antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 along disease progression in four nucleic acid test confirmed COVID-19 patients., Findings: Blood samples from a total of 14,765 patients were tested. The unweighted seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0*07% [95% CI, 0*04%-0*13%]; after weighting with the population demographics of Taiwan, the estimated overall seroprevalence was 0*05% [95% CI, 0*02%-0*10%]. Furthermore, based on data of the four COVID-19 cases, the seroconversion dates for IgM were as early as 9 days and that for IgG 11 days after symptoms onset., Interpretation: We screened the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a small-scale population-based study and observed an approximately 0*05% seroprevalence of COVID-19, indicating that the current containment protocols emphasising mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and mandatory quarantine for all incomers are effective in Taiwan., Funding: Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

The goal of this study was to determine the clinical and sociodemographic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a region of the Colombian Caribbean., METHODS: Between July and November 2020, a cross-sectional observational study was carried out in Cordoba, located in northeast Colombia in the Caribbean area. Eight municipalities with the largest populations were chosen and 2564 blood samples were taken. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used with the recombinant protein antigen N of SARS-CoV-2. The people included in the study were asked for sociodemographic and clinical data, which were analysed by statistical methods., RESULTS: A seroprevalence of 40.8% was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 in the Cordoba region. In the bivariate analysis, no differences were observed in seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 for gender or age range (p>0.05). Higher seropositivity was found in low socio-economic status and symptomatic patients (p<0.0001). A total of 30.7% of the asymptomatic patients were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, which could be linked to the spread of this infection. In the multivariate analysis, seroconversion was related to poverty and clinical manifestations such as anosmia and ageusia (p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The high seropositivity in Cordoba is due to widespread SARS-CoV-2 in this population. The relationship between seropositivity and socio-economic status suggests a higher exposure risk to the virus caused by informal economic activities in low-income groups. Clinical manifestations such as anosmia and ageusia could be clinical predictors of infection by the new emergent coronavirus. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Do aspirating systems have a role in preventing COVID-19 transmission among dental healthcare workers?.,"Gugnani, Neeraj; Gugnani, Shalini","Aim The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine and compare the seropositivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 among dental healthcare workers (HCWs) working in three different clinics using different types of aspirating systems. The study took place in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation). Methods A total of 157 HCWs from three different clinics (56, 60 and 41 HCWs, respectively) who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic period (May to August 2020) constituted the cohort. All of the three chosen clinics had followed COVID-19 screening, triage and other recommendations for safe practice. In addition to using personal protective equipment and other common barrier methods to lower virus transmission, these clinics were equipped with different types of aspirating systems that included V6000 used in dry mode, V6000 used in semi-dry mode and VS900, respectively. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and SARS-CoV-2-IgM-EIA-BEST enzyme immunoassay kits (Vector-Best). Results An overall prevalence of seropositivity was observed to be 11.5% (19/157 HCWs) over a five-month follow-up. The prevalence of infection was not found to be associated with sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). Significantly higher infection rates (p <0.001) were observed among HCWs working in the clinic equipped with the VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters, while the lowest infection rate was found among HCWs working in the clinic using the V6000 aspirating system in dry mode. Conclusions HCWs working in the clinic equipped with an aspirating system which has HEPA filters and released the air into an external environment (V6000) exhibited significantly lower seroprevalence rates compared to HCWs in the clinic using an aspirating system without HEPA filters which released air within the dental operatory away from the operation site (VS900).",2021,/,Evidence-based dentistry,22,2,50-51,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41432-021-0171-5,34172902,#131914,Gugnani 2021,"",""

Identifying factors associated with seroprevalence can help establish better practices in healthcare settings. In this study, we evaluate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among previously undiagnosed HCWs and describe profiling of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)., METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 386 HCWs in a university hospital in Egypt and 725 volunteers not affiliated to any healthcare facility (non-healthcare workers - NHCWs). Participants provided a nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, respectively. HCWs who tested positive by either test were sequentially monitored., RESULTS: At baseline, point prevalence of viral carriage was 11.4% in HCWs (n = 44/386) and 11.9% in NHCWs (86/725). The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs considering all studies was 25.6%, which was statistically lower than in NHCWs (41.0%). Prevalence was greatest among janitorial staff (45.9%) and the most affected departments were gastroenterology (31.1%), and emergency medicine (30.0%). Prior anosmia, fever or headache were associated with higher odds of positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding serial antibody measurements, RT-PCR-positive HCWs displayed IgG detection rates of 29.5%, 70% and 60% at visit 1, visit 2 and visit 3, respectively with slow decline of median IgG antibody titers, whereas, corresponding detection rates for total Ig antibodies were 50%, 90.3%, and 88.9%, respectively with increasing median titers. NAbs measured at each time point were positively correlated with total Ig levels, whereas IgG levels were positively correlated with NAbs at visit 1 and visit 3., CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate lower cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs than general population and suggest that asymptomatic HCWs exhibit considerable IgG and total Ig antibodies response as well as NAbs for up to 120 days, with positive correlation in between.

Various technologies, including laboratory assays and point-of-care self-tests, are available for antibody testing. The interpretation of seroprevalence studies requires comparative data on the performance of antibody tests. <h4>Methods</h4> In June 2020, current and former members of the UK Police forces and Fire service performed a self-test lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and provided a saliva sample, nasopharyngeal swab, venous blood samples for Abbott ELISA and had a nurse performed LFIA. We present the prevalence of PCR positivity and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort following the first wave of infection in England; the acceptability and usability of self-test LFIAs (defined as use of the LFIA kit and provision of a valid result, respectively); and determine the sensitivity and specificity of LFIAs compared to laboratory ELISAs. <h4>Results</h4> In this cohort of non-healthcare key workers, 7.4% (396/5,348; 95% CI, 6.7-8.1) were antibody positive. Seroprevalence was 8.9% (6.9-11.4) in those under 40 years, 11.5% (8.8-15.0) in those of non-white British ethnicity and 7.8% (7.1-8.7) in those currently working. The self-test LFIA had an acceptability of 97.7% and a usability of 90.0%. There was substantial agreement between within-participant LFIA results (kappa 0.80; 0.77-0.83). The LFIAs (self-test and nurse-performed) had a similar performance: compared to ELISA, sensitivity was 82.1% (77.7-86.0) self-test and 76.4% (71.9-80.5) nurse-performed with specificity of 97.8% (97.3-98.2) and 98.5% (98.1-98.8) respectively. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A greater proportion of the non-healthcare key worker cohort showed evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population at 6.0% (5.8-6.1) following the first wave in England. The high acceptability and usability reported by participants and the similar performance of self-test and nurse-performed LFIAs indicate that the self-test LFIA is fit for purpose for home-testing in occupational and community prevalence studies.",2021,,,,,,PPR361566,10.1101/2021.06.21.21259254,,#132354,Davies 2021,"",""

The advancing age and hospitalization predicted seropositivity among patients with past infection. Half of the participants who tested positive for antibodies were not aware of past infection. Conclusion(s): High-burden contexts in Greece, such as Deskati, are not so far from herd immunity thresholds. We highlighted the value of low-cost sero-surveys targeting both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations to evaluate the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in nonvaccinated susceptibles and design evidence-based policies for lifting lockdowns.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Testing was performed and a questionnaire was completed by 4592 workers on a voluntary basis from 21 May to 31 July 2020. We computed the apparent IgM, IgG, and combined IgM or IgG prevalence, along with the true prevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) using Bayesian inference., RESULTS: We found an apparent prevalence of 3.1% for IgM, 1.0% for IgG and 3.9% for either. The estimated true prevalence was 2.0% (95% CrI 0.1% to 4.3%) for IgM, 0.6% (95% CrI 0.0% to 1.3%) for IgG, and 2.5% (95% CrI 0.1% to 5.3%) for IgM or IgG. A SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis was reported by 21 (0.5%) workers; and of these, 90.5% had a reactive IgG result. Seroprevalence was higher among those reporting contacts with confirmed cases, having been quarantined, having a previous molecular negative test or having had symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence among workers from the three public higher education institutions of Porto after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to national estimates for the same age working population. However, the estimated true seroprevalence was approximately five times higher than the reported SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a molecular test. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This study evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers in a tertiary care hospital and then correlated seroprevalence with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHOD: The study was approved by our institution's Joint Research Ethics Committee in June 2020. All volunteers were provided with a consent form, an information leaflet and a questionnaire on the day before phlebotomy. Serum samples were collected from 1176 participants over a 3-month period and analysed using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) which detects total antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARs-COV-2., RESULTS: Overall anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among participating healthcare workers was 17.9%. The rate of confirmed infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction molecular testing prior to participation was 12.2%. Of 211 participants who had a reactive antibody test result, 37% did not have COVID-19 infection confirmed at any point prior to participation in this study, either having had a swab which did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA or having never been tested.

Staff with more patient contact had a higher seroprevalence of 19.5% compared to 13.4% in staff with less patient contact., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers may be asymptomatic or subclinical and thus potentially represent a significant transmission risk to colleagues and patients.",2021,/,Irish journal of medical science,,"gxb, 7806864, 7806865",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02690-4,34195921,#132201,Leonard 2021,"",""
Prevalence of sars-cov-2 igg antibodies in patients with cystic fibrosis at the minnesota cystic fibrosis center in the first 6 months of known virus in the state and in follow-up (6 months and 1 year),"Mahan, K.; Kiel, S.; Noren, B.; Bailey, M.; Carey, D.; Yun, K.; Heisdorfer, J.; Sultan, S.; Billings, J.L.; Dunitz, J.M. ","RATIONALE: Since the first known US case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) was reported in early 2020, little was known about the prevalence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population. CF is a genetic disorder caused by more than 1700 different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in a wide spectrum of disease phenotypes. As the majority of individuals with CF have chronic lung disease, this population is considered to be high risk for severe disease if infected with any virus, especially that of SARS-CoV 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). As the number of cases in the US nears 18 million and the number of deaths in the US is currently reported at greater than 318,000, the prevalence of COVID-19 in the CF population remains largely unknown although the clinical course for those infected is becoming more clear. To date, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation reported 344 cases of COVID-19 in the US and 3 people who have died, giving a case fatality rate of 0.9%. METHOD(S): Early in the course of the pandemic, we began studying the exposures, and symptoms of people with CF to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in patients who receive care at the MN CF Center. Individuals >/= 12 years of age completed a brief, online survey detailing possible exposures, symptoms of COVID-19, and behavioral data (e.g. social distancing practices). We extracted additional data through the electronic medical record (EMR) to identify risk factors for COVID-19 IgG development including age, BMI, sex, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), CFTR modulator use, diabetes. Participants were evaluated for COVID-19 IgG at the time of enrollment (0 months) and the natural history of COVID-19 IgG will be further elucidated with additional Ab testing at 6 months and 12 months post-enrollment. RESULT(S): Early data includes 75 enrollees with an average age of 35 years. 51% of participants are female. Of those tested, 9.5% had a positive COVID IgG test. 83% of those individuals tested positive for COVID with PCR analysis. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more prevalent in the state of MN and the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG in individuals with cystic fibrosis suggest similar exposure as the general community. Additional data collection at 6 months and 12 months will identify the natural progression of IgG immunity in in CF patients in response to COVID-19.",2021,/,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,203,9,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2021.203.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3788,635307092,#130438,Mahan 2021,"",""

","RATIONALE: Healthcare workers (HCW) are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. It is also not known to what extent the natural production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is protective against re-infection. Method(s): A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. New laboratory confirmed infections post September 2020 were recorded to determine if the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protect against re-infection. Result(s): A total of 2063 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.5% were white. 300 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (Odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.3% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 10.9% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. 18.7% of HCW had an asymptomatic infection. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies. There were 38 new infections with SARS-CoV-2 in HCW who were previously antibody negative and 1 symptomatic RT-PCR positive re-infection in a HCW who had detectable antibodies 76 days prior to re-infection. The presence of antibodies was 85% protective against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.35, p=0.03).

METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective serological study on all residents and staff members of three homeless shelters run by Samusocial of Paris, between July and August 2020: 2 centres providing healthcare accommodation (HCA) and one women's dormitory. We included all adults present in the shelters or who died of a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave (March-May). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in serum samples using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect (Abbott) test. Any participant with a positive PCR or serology was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case. RESULT(S): We included 100 residents and 83 staff members. The confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rate by PCR or serology was 72/100 (72.0%) for residents and 17/83 (20.5%) for staff members. Women accommodated in the dormitory had the highest infection attack rate (90.6%). Hospitalization rate in residents was 17/72 (23.6%) and the death rate 4/72 (5.6%). All hospitalizations and deaths occurred among HCA residents. 34/68 (50%) of the residents of HCA shelters presented at least two comorbidity factors associated with being at high risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was high in residents of these homeless shelters (10.6% seroprevalence in the Ile-de-France region during the first wave). Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection was highly associated with the prevalence of comorbidities.

With a prevailing pandemic such as COVID-19, it becomes important to understand the presence and persistence of antibodies in the serum of HCW, testing positive for COVID-19 on Reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). An understanding of the prevalence of IgG antibodies against COVID-19 and the duration for which they are present in the serum will help in predicting the immune response of individuals against the disease. Aim(s): To study the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in laboratory confirmed COVID-19 RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects. Material(s) and Method(s): The present longitudinal study was conducted from April 2020 to December 2020 with a sample size of 90 participants based on a pilot study. Blood sample was collected and serum was separated. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was done to detect the presence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in serum. Chi-square test and Pearson correlation were used to find out the statistical significance of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in COVID-19 positive and negative HCWs and the relationship between Cycle threshold values (Ct) and antibody levels, respectively. Result(s): Fever with sore throat was the most common (33%) symptom. Chi-square test done to compare IgG among RT-PCR positive and negative subjects showed p-value of <0.00001 which was significant. However, statistical significance was not found (p-value 0.9973) with respect to COVID-19 IgG antibodies in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Mean antibody index in symptomatic and asymptomatic was 3.7743+/-1.9834 and 3.571+/-1.7961, respectively. Average number of days, the antibodies persisted was 25 days-266 days. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects was 88%, 67% and 27%, respectively. The maximum number of days antibodies persisted was 266 days.

METHOD(S): Data from 77,075 individuals aged 20 to 59 from three steps of the EPICOVID-19 Brazil (a nationwide serological survey conducted between May and June, 2021) were assessed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by rapid tests. Self-reported prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease and heart disease were investigated. The prevalence of mask use, adherence to isolation measures and antibodies were evaluated separately amid carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases. The prevalence of symptoms was analyzed among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases with antibodies. RESULT(S): The prevalence of at least one chronic disease was 43%, higher in the Southeast region, among white and indigenous individuals, women, less schooled and in lower socioeconomic position. The use of masks when leaving home was similar among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases (98%). The proportion of participants who reported adherence to isolation measures was higher amid carriers (15.9%) than non-carriers (24.9%) of chronic diseases. The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was similar amongst carriers and non-carriers (2.4% and 2.3%). The prevalence of cough, dyspnea, palpitations and myalgia was significantly higher among carriers, but the proportion of symptomatic patients was similar between groups. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of chronic diseases in Brazil is high and the COVID-19 pandemic affects carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases similarly.

Of the 16 seropositive participants, 14 had already known their SARS-CoV-2 infection because they had performed a PCR-test previously triggered by symptoms. Trailing chains of infection by self-assessment, 31% (n = 5) of infections were acquired through private contacts, 25% (n = 4) most likely through semi-private contacts during work. 13% (n = 2) were assumed to result through contact with contagious patients, further trailing was unsuccessful in 31% (n = 5). All five participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at inclusion remained positive with a median of 7 months after infection., DISCUSSION: Frontline HP caring for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Noteworthy, based upon identified chains of infection most of the infections were acquired in private environment and semi-private contacts during work. The low rate of infection through infectious patients reveals that professional hygiene standards are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in HP.

Immune response to sars-cov-2 in an asymptomatic pediatric allergic cohort,"Fregoso, Diana J.; Marsteller, Nathan L.; Morphew, Tricia L.; Randhawa, Inderpal S. ","Disease-specific COVID-19 pediatric comorbidity has not been studied effectively to date. Atopy and food anaphylaxis disease states require improved characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. To provide the first such characterization, we assessed serum samples of a highly atopic, food anaphylactic, asymptomatic pediatric cohort from across the US during the height of the pandemic. From our biobank, 172 pediatric patient serum samples were characterized specific to atopic, food anaphylactic, and immunologic markers in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, from 1 February to 20 April 2020. Clinical and demographic data were further analyzed in addition to sample analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were positive in six patients (4%). Nearly half of the pediatric patients had a history of asthma (49%). Total IgE, total IgG, and IgG1-3 were similar in those positive and negative to SARS-CoV-2. Median total IgG4 in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was nearly three times (p-value = 0.02) that of the negative group. Atopy controller medications did not confer additional benefit. Our data suggest that food anaphylaxis and highly atopic children are not at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. This specific population appears either at equal or potentially less risk than the general population. Total and specific IgG4 may be a novel predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk specific to the allergic pediatric population.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Method(s): Observational study. Study Set 1: 43 Covid-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) donors-individuals recovered from Covid-19 infection (symptoms+/positive RTPCR report). Study Set 2: 47 asymptomatic whole blood donors-no prior Covid-19 positive diagnosis/symptoms.

Neutralisation Assay: SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (GenScript USA);neutralisation inhibition capacity was expressed in %; >=20% inhibition was correlated to high titres of NAb. Result(s): Sociodemography: Distribution of Age, gender, blood groups and donation status between the two groups of donors were similar with no statistical difference. SARS-CoV-2-IgG CLIA assay: Among 90, 33 donors had mean OD S/Co value of 7.4 (range 6.1-11.8) and 57 had mean OD S/Co value of 24.3 (range 12.1-42). Neutralising Antibodies (NAb) assay: Neutralization Inhibition of 90 SARS-CoV-2-IgG positive samples among both the groups was >20%, with mean of 77.4% among the CCP donors and 75.2% among the whole blood donors (p=0.157). Also, Inhibition % appeared similar in two groups with respect to age, gender, blood group, donation status without any statistical significance (Table 1). Summary/Conclusions: No significance difference in neutralising antibody capacity was observed in asymptomatic whole blood donors and Convalescent plasma donors. Therefore, donors having adequate levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels on screening can be considered for Convalescent plasma donation irrespective of prior Covid-19 diagnosis or Covid-related symptoms.

","Background: When a new disease such as COVID-19 emerges, epidemiological surveillance and testing strategies initially focus on patients with severe disease and the use of molecular diagnostics to detect acute infections as they seek and need care. With this approach, some patients with mild or asymptomatic infection who do not require medical attention may not be identified, with the result that the true extent of the infection remains unknown. 'Antibodies' are part of the body's immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are usually detected in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether the infection is severe, mild, or asymptomatic. Aim(s): Determine the seroprevalence to SARS-COV-2 among the employees of the organization. Method(s): From January 18 to February 1, 2021, employees of the Scientific-Production Center for Transfusiology (Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan) underwent laboratory serological testing for the presence of antibodies toSARS-CoV-2. Employees signed informed consent and donated venous blood. The level of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum was determined using test systems manufactured by ABBOTT on Architect i2000sr device (ABBOTT, USA) in our own laboratory. Result(s): Of the 270 employees, 222 (82.2%) donated venous blood for research. The average age of employees was 41 +/- 11 years, of which 80.2% were women. A positive result of studies of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was found in 50 employees (22.5%). Of these, 26 employees (11.7%) did not previously have a verified diagnosis and history of complaints, did not seek medical help. In addition, another 29 employees (13.1%), who also did not contract the disease in an active form, had 'traces' of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (positivity coefficient from 0.3 to 1.3). Summary/Conclusions: Serological testing helps to retrospectively determine the extent of an outbreak or the prevalence of infection in the population of interest. Seroprevalence studies give a more complete picture of which part of the population is infected with SARSCoV- 2, allowing to identify cases of infection that were not detected during routine or active epidemiological control, as well as to determine the immune status of a particular population before the onset of a new wave.",2021,/,Vox Sanguinis,116,SUPPL 1,145-146,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.13117,635297072,#130336,Abdrakhmanova 2021,"",""

Twenty-six percent of 3,347 specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The Ab response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length spike and the spike S2 domain.

Nucleocapsid protein Abs can be used to distinguish individuals in a population of vaccinees to classify those who have been previously infected and those who have not, because nucleocapsid is not in the vaccine.

Aim(s): To determine if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in blood donor plasma samples collected between January, (prior to the first identified case in Madrid on February 25) and the third week of March, before the first outbreak and rapid spread of the infection in the region Methods: On October 2020 a total of 2,419 residual archived EDTA plasma samples, collected from blood donors that donate blood from January 1 to March 22, 2020 and stored at -40degreeC, in the blood transfusion center, were analyzed for total qualitative (IgM+IgG) anti- SARS-COV-2 antibodies (MosaiQ COVID-19 Antibody Magazine, Quotient Suisse SA) (n= 800, 1071 and 548, collected on January, February and March 2020, respectively). Result(s): We have not found the presence of IgG + IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the samples collected on January and February 2020. Only two positive donations were detected in the samples collected on the first and second week of March. They represent 0.36% of the total donations analyzed onMarch and 0.08%of the total included in the study. Summary/Conclusions: Our results show a very low anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence rate among the total number of analyzed samples. These data would suggest that only a few infected cases are needed to trigger an outbreak as the observed in Madrid during March 2020, in contrast to expected, confirming the high infectivity of SARS COV-2 virus. This would be in accordance with the rapid increase in cases that has been observed in the following outbreak. Also confirm the high infectivity of SARS COV-2 virus and the importance of the rapidly introduction of protective measures in order to prevent the transmission.

"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in blood donors during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Peshawar, Pakistan","Nisar, M.; Saba, N.; Khalid, M.; Yousafzai, Y.; Waheed, U. ","Background: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), first reported in December 2019, has spread across the globe resulting in an ongoing pandemic affecting healthcare systems and the economy across all continents. It is uncertain how many individuals have acquired the SARS-CoV-2 virus without knowing and are asymptomatic. Hence, the number of COVID-19 reported cases do not accurately reflect the precise number of those affected. Antibody-based screening assays for SARS-CoV-2 can prove useful to assess the magnitude of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and to monitor the overall pandemic. In Pakistan, scanty data exist about the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals. Aim(s): To determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthy blood donors at a Regional Blood Centre in Peshawar, Pakistan. Method(s): This single-centre cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, at the Regional Blood Centre, Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 2,147 blood donors were tested for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) from Roche Diagnostics International Ltd. (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The result of a sample was given either as positive for SARS-CoV-2 (if the result's cut-off index is >=1.0) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (if the result's cut-off index is <1.0). Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 22.0. The study was endorsed by the ethical committee of Khyber Medical University, Peshawar. Result(s): Among 2,147 blood donors, 23 (1%) were females and 2,124 (99%) were males of different age groups ranging from 18-50 years of age. The mean age of the donors was 25.63 +/- 7.05 years. Among the 2,147 blood donors tested, 1,159 (54%) were reactive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Summary/Conclusions: This present study assessed the prevalence of antibodies in those healthy blood donors having no previous record of infection.

Tracking SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among Canadian blood donors through two pandemic waves selected for main programme,"Saeed, S.; Yi, Q.; Osmond, L.; O'Brien, S.; Drews, S.; Pambrun, C. ","Background: Tracking the proportion of the population exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) over time enhances our understanding of population-level immunity, the burden of infection and guides public health policies. Aim(s): Using residual blood from healthy blood donors we estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates by sociodemographic factors over two pandemic waves in Canada. Method(s): This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between April 6, 2020 and January 27, 2021 from people donating at all Canadian Blood Services (CBS) locations. CBS collects approximately 850,000 blood donations per year from a combination of fixed and mobile sites in all larger cities and most urban areas from all provinces in Canada except Quebec. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (targeting nucleocapsid) antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to populationlevel demographics and the assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Over the study periods seroprevalence rates were stratified by region, age, ABO blood groups, ethnicity and quintiles of material and social deprivation indices (Q1 [least deprived] -Q5 [most deprived]). Predictors of reactivity were evaluated using hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models during wave 1 (April-August 2020) and wave 2 (October 2020-January 2021). Result(s): Overall 179,473 retention samples were tested. Adjusted seroprevalence increased significantly from 0.70% (95% CI 0.63, 0.77) between April and August 2020 (Wave 1) to 1.51% (95% CI 1.31, 1.71) in November 2020 (Wave 2) and 1.99% (95% CI 1.84, 2.15) in January 2021 (Wave 2). Based on the most recent survey in January 2021, there were significant variations by regions and age groups. Across Canada seroprevalence remained the highest in Manitoba (3.92% [95% CI 2.92, 4.93]) and as low as 0.5% (95% CI 0.09, 1.03) in Atlantic Canada. Donors aged 17-24 years old had the highest seroprevalence rate (3.45% [95% CI 2.87, 4.02]) compared to all other age groups. Disparities by socioeconomic status and racialized groups widened over time. Donors living in the most materially deprived neighborhoods were nearly four-times more likely to be seropositive than those living in affluent neighborhoods (4.04% vs.1.17%). Racialized groups were two times more likely to be seropositive compared to self-identified white donors (3.37% vs.1.66%). During Wave 1, only ethnicity and living in the most populous province in Canada were significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Wave 2, in addition to regional differences there was a significant dose response association between living in material deprived neighborhoods and SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR); 95% CI) Q2 (aOR 1.5; 1.2, 1.9); Q3: (aOR 1.7; 1.4, 2.2); Q4: (aOR 1.9; 1.5, 2.4); Q5 (most deprived) (aOR 2.7; 2.1, 3.5) compared to Q1 (least deprived). Summary/Conclusions:Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health policies. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence remained low in Canada but there were significant variations by regions and sociodemographic factors. Our results may be underestimated due to waning antibodies.

To assess the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, an urban/suburban county in Western PA, 393 human blood samples collected in Fall 2020 and February 2021 were examined for spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antibodies. All RBD-positive samples were evaluated for virus-specific neutralization activity. Our results showed a seroprevalence of 5.5% by RBD ELISA, 4.5% by N ELISA, and 2.5% for both in Fall 2020, which increased to 24.7% by RBD ELISA, 14.9% by N ELISA, and 12.9% for both in February 2021. Neutralization titer was significantly correlated with RBD titer but not with N titer. Using these two assays, we were able to distinguish infected from vaccinated individuals. In the February cohort, higher median income and white race were associated with serological findings consistent with vaccination.

Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5%, IQR 2.4-8.4%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6% perinatal) to high (59% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p<0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p<0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95% CI 2.64-4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.96-3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95% CI 1.01-32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.60-2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95% CI 1.28-3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9-38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames., DISCUSSION: Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved.

However, there are limited school data accounting for asymptomatic cases, particularly late in the 2020/21 school year, and in the context of uninterrupted in-person schooling and widespread community transmission. <h4>Objectives</h4> To determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a sample of school staff, compared to the community, and to COVID-19 rates among all students and staff within the same school population. <h4>Design</h4> Incident COVID-19 cases among students and school staff using public health data, with an embedded cross-sectional serosurvey among school staff sampled from February 10 to May 15, 2021, comparing to age, sex and geographic location-matched blood donors sampled in January 2021. <h4>Setting</h4> Vancouver School District (British Columbia, Canada) from kindergarten to grade 12. <h4>Participants</h4> Active s chool staff enrolled from February 3 to April 23, 2021. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of school staff using spike (S)-based testing (unvaccinated staff) or N-based serology testing (vaccinated staff). <h4>Results</h4> The incidence of COVID-19 cases among students attending in-person was 9.8 per 1,000 students during the 2020/21 school year (N = 47,280 students), and among staff was 13 per 1,000 since the beginning of the pandemic (N = 7,071 active school staff). In total, 1,689 school staff (64% elementary, 28% secondary, 8.3% school board staff or multiple grades) completed the questionnaire, 78.2% had classroom responsibilities, and spent a median of 17.6 hours in class per week [IQR: 5.0 – 25 hours]. Although 21.5% (363/1,686) reported close contact with a COVID-19 case, only 1.4% (24/1688) of the school staff reported having had a positive viral nucleic acid test. Of this group, five believed they acquired the infection at school. The adjusted seroprevalence in staff who gave blood (1,556/1,689, 92.1%) was 2.3% [95%CI: 1.6 – 3.2%] compared to 2.3% [95%CI: 1.7 – 3.0%] in blood donors. <h4>Conclusion and relevance</h4> Despite high reported COVID-19 cases among students and staff, and frequent within-school exposures, we found no detectable increase in seroprevalence among school staff above the community seroprevalence. These findings corroborate claims that, with appropriate mitigation strategies, in-person schooling is not associated with significantly increased risk for school staff. <h4>Key Points</h4> <h4>Question</h4> What was the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in school staff who maintained in-person schooling during the 2020/21 school year in Vancouver, British Columbia, and how does it compare to the risk of COVID-19 infection in the community. <h4>Findings</h4> As of March 4, 2021, the incidence of COVID-19 cases among school staff was 13 per 1,000 (N = 7,071 school staff) since the beginning of the pandemic.

Current challenges of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies among blood donors: A scoping review selected for main programme,"Saeed, S.; Uzicanin, S.; Lewin, A.; Lieshout-Krikke, R.; Erikstrup, C.; Seed, C.; Faddy, H.; Steele, W.; Custer, B.; O'Brien, S. ","Background: Given the unprecedented urgency to evaluate the true burden of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies were mobilized quickly. Worldwide blood services leveraged their operational capacity to lead SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies with the intent of informing public health. While blood donors are a common and convenient population to conduct seroprevalence studies, challenges exist. Aim(s): We conducted a scoping review to summarize SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates specifically from blood donor populations, evaluate methodology and provide epidemiological guidance for future research. Method(s): PubMed and MedRvix databases were systematically reviewed for seroprevalence studies among blood donors between January 2020 to 2021. Using standardized forms, two reviewers extracted seroprevalence rates and methodology pertaining to population sampling, periodicity, assay characteristics and antibody kinetics. Data on cumulative incidence and social distancing policies at the country-level were extracted from publicly available sources. Cumulative case detection was extracted two-weeks from the end of each study period to calculate case identification ratios. Result(s): From 157 articles, 33 studies representing 1,323,307 blood donors from 20 countries were included. The majority were from Europe (n=8), followed by North America (n=4), Asia (n=4), Africa (n=2), South America (n=1) and Australia (n=1). Seroprevalence studies from low- and middle-income countries were limited. The majority (94%) of the studies initiated sero-surveys within three months of the WHO pandemic declaration. Overall 79% of the studies found seroprevalence to be less than 10%. However, there was significant variability between countries from as high as 76% in parts of Brazil (adjusting for waning antibodies), to as low as 0% in Saudi Arabia. We also found significant heterogeneity by study design and methodology. 52% of studies reported seroprevalence at a single time point. Stratification by age and sex were most common (64%), followed by region (48%). Overall less than 1 in 3 studies, standardized seroprevalence rates to reflect the demographics of the target population. From 34 studies, 27 unique assay combinations were identified; 74% of studies used a single assay to determine reactive samples. Less than half of the studies adjusted rates for imperfect test performance. We evaluated the association between cumulative incidence and seroprevalence and found case detection was significantly under reported in Kenya, USA (NYC), Pakistan, Italy, and China. The median case identification ratio was 1:11.4 but as high as 1:1262 in Kenya. We found no association between seroprevalence rates and policy stringency. Summary/Conclusions: Overall the majority of the studies reported prevalence rates <10%; levels far from reaching herd immunity. In addition to differences in community transmission and diverse public health policies, study designs and methodology were likely contributing factors associated with seroprevalence heterogeneity. Despite limitations, blood donors will continue to play a vital role in facilitating seroprevalence studies to assess and monitor the burden of COVID-19.",2021,/,Vox Sanguinis,116,SUPPL 1,141-142,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.13117,635297016,#130326,Saeed 2021,"",""

","Background: According to the current knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 serology tests serve to determine the seroprevalence in a given population, to identify potential donors of Covid convalescent plasma (CCP), to complement molecular testing in diagnosis of acute infection, vaccine evaluation studies etc. Aim(s): To determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors in order to assess natural immunity in the general population and to identify potential donors of convalescent plasma. The second aim was to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the group of medical workers in our blood transfusion facility. Method(s): In the period from November, 2020 to March, 2021 (before the start of vaccination), besides the routine TTI testing, we performed SARS-CoV-2 IgG test in every blood donor who met the usual donor selection criteria, as well as the additional criteria concerning the coronavirus pandemic, such as normal body temperature, no signs of infection, no recent contact etc. We used Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay on Architect 2000 platform. Result(s): We tested 9773 blood donors out of which 2437(25%) had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The index of the test > 5 S/C was observed in 813 (33.6%) of the positive donors whose samples were further subjected to a SARS-Cov-2 RBD-IgG test in order to identify plasma units as CCP. The seropositivity among blood donors was increasing, being 12.4%, 25.0%, 28.8% and 29.5% in the months from November until the end of February. The highest seroprevalence of 33.0% was observed in the blood donors from the western part of the country. The overall seropositivity in blood donors was significantly lower (25.0%) in comparison to blood facility medical workers (35.2%).

In total, 11 phases were performed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was identified in venous blood using a lateral flow test, Wondfo Biotech. In the last phase, it was combined with an immunoenzymatic test, Euroimmun. Participants also answered a semi-structured questionnaire on sociodemographic and economic factors and social distancing measures. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated according to the region, Human Development Index, sex, age group, ethnicity, education, income and variables associated with risk or prevention of the infection. To compare the frequencies among the categories of each variable, the chi-square test with Rao Scott correction was used, considering a 5% significance level. <h4>Results</h4> In total, 23,397 individuals were interviewed and had their samples collected. The estimated prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 9.7% (95%CI: 7.9-11.8%) to 25.0% (95%CI: 21.7-28.7). The prevalence of individuals with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was higher among black and pardo people, people with lower schooling, people with lower income and among residents of regions with lower Human Development Index. The lowest prevalences were associated with recommended measures of disease protection. The proportion of asymptomatic infection was 45.1%. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower than the cumulative incidence variation, except for the last phase of the study. The differences in prevalence estimates observed among subpopulations showed the social inequality as a risk of infection. The lower prevalence observed among those who could follow prevention measures reinforce the need to maintain the social distancing measures as ways to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR359154,10.1101/2021.06.16.21256530,,#129515,Albuquerque 2021,"",""

Given that some of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are asymptomatic, antibody tests are useful to determine whether there is a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we measured IgM and IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of asymptomatic healthy subjects in The University of Tokyo, Japan., METHODS: From June 2020, we recruited participants, who were students, staff, and faculty members of The University of Tokyo in the project named The University of Tokyo COVID-19 Antibody Titer Survey (UT-CATS). Following blood sample collection, participants were required to answer an online questionnaire about their social and health information. We measured IgG and IgM titers against SARS-CoV-2 using iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection kit which applies a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection., RESULTS: There were 6609 volunteers in this study. After setting the cutoff value at 10 AU/mL, 32 (0.48%) were positive for IgG and 16 (0.24%) for IgM. Of six participants with a history of COVID-19, five were positive for IgG, whereas all were negative for IgM. The median titer of IgG was 0.40 AU/mL and 0.39 AU/mL for IgM. Both IgG and IgM titers were affected by gender, age, smoking status, and comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Positive rates of IgG and IgM titers were relatively low in our university.

We sought to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, their duration, and capacity for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in volunteers while the pandemic spread within our community starting in March 2020. Those participants with the highest starting titers had the longest-lasting response, up to 12 months post-diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. The majority of our participants with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had very mild or asymptomatic infections. We also detected low and largely non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG titers in a few participants with no known COVID-19 diagnosis.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among health care workers before the Era of vaccination: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Kayi, Ilker; Madran, Bahar; Keske, Siran; Karanfil, Ozge; Arribas, Jose Ramon; Pshenichnaya, Natalia; Petrosillo, Nicola; Gonen, Mehmet; Ergonul, Onder","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs provide information to for the spread of COVID-19 within health care facilities, and to detect the risk groups., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and its determinants among health care workers., DATA SOURCES: We used Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost and Cochrane Library., STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included the reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence with a sample size of minimum 1,000 HCWs., METHODS: The study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, no: CRD42021230456). We used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The keywords were ""COVID-19, ""SARS-Co-2"", ""Coronavirus"", ""seroprevalence"", ""health care workers"" and ""risk factors""., RESULTS: In total 4329 reports were retrieved, the duplications were removed, after filtering according to the title and abstract 25 studies were selected. Risk of bias was assessed in 25 studies; it was low in 13 studies, medium in four studies, and high in eight studies. In meta-analysis by using the random effect model, the weighted average of seroprevalence was calculated as 8% (CI: 6%-10%). The pooled seroprevalence rates of the selected variables that have a rate over the average were male HCWs with 9% (95% CI 7%-11%); HCWs from ethnic minorities with 13% (95% CI: 9% - 17%); high exposure 9% (95% CI: %6 - %13); exposure to the virus outside the health care setting %22 (95% CI: %14 - %32)., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate of 8% among studies included >1,000 HCWs for the year 2020 before vaccinations started. The most common risk factors associated with higher seroprevalence rate were ethnicity, male gender, and having higher number of household contacts.

Participants answered weekly electronic questionnaires covering information about nasopharyngeal swabs (PCR/rapid antigen tests) and symptoms compatible with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Screening of symptomatic staff by nasopharyngeal swabs was routinely performed in participating facilities. We compared numbers of positive nasopharyngeal tests and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms between HCW with and without anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 4’818 HCW participated, whereof 144 (3%) were seropositive at baseline. We analysed 107’820 questionnaires with a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Median number of answered questionnaires was similar (24 vs . 23 per person, P=0.83) between those with and without positive baseline serology. Among 2’713 HCW with ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up, 3/67 (4.5%) seropositive individuals reported a positive result (one of whom asymptomatic), compared to 547/2646 (20.7%) seronegative participants, 12 of whom asymptomatic (risk ratio [RR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.66).

There is a lack of serological prevalence data in this age group. We have some interim data from our research for WHO unity protocol, which might help policymakers and the research community to answer such questions based on evidence. Hence, we conducted a study to compare the COVID -19 sero-positivity rate between children and adults Methods/Materials: This is part of an ongoing large multi-centric population-based sero-surveillance study. The study is being conducted in five selected states with a proposed total sample size of 10,000. We have data of 4,500 participants at the time of midterm analysis from four states of India. Total serum antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed qualitatively by using a standard ELISA kit.

Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history., RESULTS: Overall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239 students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis.

","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are believed to be at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is not known to what extent the natural production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is protective against re-infection. Method(s): A prospective observational study of HCWs in Scotland (UK) from May to September 2020 was performed. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general local population, were studied for comparison. New infections (up to 2 December 2020) post antibody testing were recorded to determine whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protects against re-infection. Result(s): A total of 2063 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. At enrolment, 300 HCWs had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). HCWs therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.85-6.16; p<0.0001). Dentists were most likely to test positive. 97.3% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR had positive antibodies. 18.7% had an asymptomatic infection. There were 38 new infections with SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs who were previously antibody negative, and one symptomatic RT-PCR-positive re-infection.

In this study we sought to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of HCWs in a pediatric emergency department (ED)., METHODS: We conducted this observational cohort study from April 14-May 13, 2020 in a pediatric ED in Orange County, CA. Asymptomatic HCW >=18 years of age were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained by fingerstick at the start of each shift. The inter-sampling interval was <=96 hours. The primary outcome was positive seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 as determined with an antibody fast detection kit (Colloidal Gold, Superbio, Timisoara, Romania) for the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) antibody., RESULTS: A total of 143 HCWs participated in the study. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 10.5% (n = 15). Positive seroprevalence was classified as IgG only (4.9%), IgM+IgG (3.5%), or IgM only (2.1%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in 0.7% of the overall study population (n = 1). Samples obtained on Day 1 indicated seropositivity in 4.2% of the study population (n = 6). Subsequent seroconversion occurred in 6.3% of participants (n = 9). The rate of seroconversion was linear with a rate of approximately one new case every two days, starting at Day 9 of the study., CONCLUSION: We observed a linear rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2-positive status among asymptomatic HCWs who underwent daily symptom surveys and temperature screens in an environment with universal source control.

In round 1, antibody seropositivity was higher in students than staff (114/893 [12.8%] vs. 79/861 [9.2%]; p = 0.016), but similar in round 2 (117/893 [13.1%] vs.117/872 [13.3%]; p = 0.85), comparable to local community seroprevalence. Between the two rounds, 8.7% (57/652) staff and 6.6% (36/549) students seroconverted (p = 0.16). Interpretation(s): In secondary schools, SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity and seroconversion rates were similar in staff and students, and comparable to local community rates.

Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the staff of a public school system in the midwestern United States,"Lopez, Lilah; Nguyen, Thao; Weber, Graham; Smith, Kendal R.; Kleimola, Katlyn; Bereda, Megan; Liu, Yiling; Skates, Steven J.; Kalinich, Mark; Accorsi, Emma K.; Santa Maria, John P. ","Since March 2020, the United States has lost over 580,000 lives to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics. This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott AlinityTM SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes. 753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.8% - 4.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1.7% (90% Credible Interval: 0.27% - 3.3%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48, 95% CI: 4-600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 7.2, 95% CI: 2.6-19). Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporation's staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact tracing, face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses.Copyright: © 2021 Lopez et al.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in students and teachers: a longitudinal study from May to October 2020 in German secondary schools.,"Kirsten, Carolin; Unrath, Manja; Luck, Christian; Dalpke, Alexander H; Berner, Reinhard; Armann, Jakob","OBJECTIVE: To quantify the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in secondary schools after their reopening in May 2020., DESIGN: Repeated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study after the reopening of schools and 4 months later., SETTING: Secondary school in Dresden, Germany., PARTICIPANTS: 1538 students grades 8-12 and 507 teachers from 13 schools., INTERVENTIONS: Serial blood sampling and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assessment., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in study population. Number of undetected cases., RESULTS: 1538 students and 507 teachers were initially enrolled, and 1334 students and 445 teachers completed both study visits. The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.6% in May/June and the same in September/October. Even in schools with reported COVID-19 cases before the lockdown of 13 March, no clusters could be identified. Of 12 persons with positive serology five had a known history of confirmed COVID-19; 23 out of 24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative., CONCLUSIONS: Schools do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low-prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group. These observations do not support school closures as a strategy fighting the pandemic in a low-prevalence setting., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00022455.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, and cases may have been missed. Our objectives were to evaluate the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of New Zealand. Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with 'grey-zone' (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.2-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI 66.0-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors. Spike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence. No unexpected SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the Southern Region of New Zealand, supporting the elimination status of the country at the time this study was conducted.

Preventive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS- CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries.

Population-based serosurveys measuring antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 provide one method for estimating previous infection rates including the symptom-free courses of the disease and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Method(s): In June 2020 we succeeded in testing almost half of the population of an Austrian township (1,359 inhabitants) with a reported higher incidence for COVID-19 infections (17 PCR positive cases have been officially reported until the date of sample collection, i.e., 1.2% of the total population). We determined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in this population, factors affecting, and symptoms correlated with prior infection. Antibodies were determined using a CE-certified quality-controlled ELISA test for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies. Result(s): We found a high prevalence of 9% positive antibodies among the town population in comparison to 6% of the neighboring villages. This was considerably higher than the officially known RT-PCR-approved COVID-19 cases (1.2%) in the town population. Twenty percent of SARS-CoV-2-antibody positive cases declared being asymptomatic in a questionnaire. On the other hand, we identified six single major symptoms, including anosmia/ageusia, weight loss, anorexia, general debility, dyspnea, and fever, and especially their combination to be of high prognostic value for predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient. Conclusion(s): This population study demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infections in an Austrian township.

Antibody levels after positive PCR-test or vaccination were described by nonlinear model. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 2517 samples were tested. Overall seroprevalence (95% CI) was 20.1% (18.5-21.7%), similar in all age groups. If all individuals vaccinated with the first dose at least 14 days before antibody measurement were assumed to be seronegative, the overall seroprevalence was 15.8% (14.4-17.3%), 4-fold larger than the proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases. According to nonlinear models, age increased anti-S-RBD IgG production after positive PCR-test but decreased after vaccination. The peak of anti-S-RBD IgG in a 52-year-old (median age of PCR-positive and/or vaccinated individuals) was significantly higher after vaccination compared with positive PCR-test (22082 (12897…26875) vs 6732 (2321…8243) AU/mL), but half-life was similar (26.5 (6.9…46.1) vs 38.3 (8.2…68.5) days). <h4>Conclusion</h4> One year after the start of COVID-19 pandemic the actual prevalence of infection is still underestimated compared with confirmed COVID-19 cases, underlining the importance of seroepidemiological studies.

Can We Protect Those We Care for in A Pandemic? - Prevalence of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes.,"Willschke, Harald; Wochele-Thoma, Thomas; Atanasov, Atanas G; Klager, Elisabeth; Haslinger, Christian; Kletecka-Pulker, Maria; Laxar, Daniel; Ay, Care; Ohlinger, Thomas; Kimberger, Oliver; Steinrigl, Adi; Holzer, Barbara; Heger, Florian; Indra, Alexander","In December 2019, the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization first reported on a cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause. Nine months later more than 1.4 million people have died from COVID 19. In this work, the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on five nursing homes in Austria, which cared for 889 residents in the first half of 2020, were examined. The research question was whether the measures taken were appropriate to prevent an outbreak within the individual facilities. To detect previously unrecognized infections, the present study evaluated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in residents and employees of the nursing homes. Following the analysis of blood samples, the prospectively collected data was connected to data from screening examinations and data from contact tracing. The present study demonstrated an overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nursing homes of 3.7%. Whereas the prevalence in those facilities that have never been hit by an outbreak is 0%, the prevalence in those facilities with an outbreak is up to 4.9%. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 35 persons. A retrospective analysis of all 5 included nursing homes demonstrated that upon regular clinical screening in combination with PCRs an infection with SARS-COV-2 was detected in 66 residents and 24 employees from different professional groups. In only 25 of the 35 persons with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 an infection was proven in advance. This study suggests that specific measures can prevent transmission within a health care facility. Nevertheless, the results also show that a risk reduction to 0% cannot be achieved.

Dynamic change of COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic office workers in Tokyo from May through Dec 2020 during the second waves of COVID-19,"Hibino, Sawako; Hayashida, Kazutaka; Ahn, Andrew; Hayashida, Yasutaka","<h4>Background: </h4> COVID-19 deaths per capita in Japan have been low compared to Western Countries despite the absence of the lockdown. It is still unclear either the less spreading of the virus or, the less progression to the severe illness. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the seropositivity rates (SPR) in the general population. We determined SPR in healthy office workers in Tokyo with validation of results by comparing two test results from the same individual a month apart. <h4>Method: </h4> Healthy office workers for a Japanese company in Tokyo were determined seropositivity against COVID19 weekly from May 26 to August 25, 2020, by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. SPR was calculated by pooled data from each two-week window. For each participant, tests were offered twice, separated by a month, to provide self-reference to validate the results. The seropositive individuals were offered a follow-up test on Dec 8th or 15th, 2020, when the third wave loomed in Tokyo, to determine the persistence of the seropositivity. <h4>Results: </h4> 615 volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; 45.7 % female) from 11 discrete locations received at least one test. 350 individuals completed two tests a month apart. The comparison showed that 93.2 % showed reasonable status changes and no instances with physiologically unexpected changes (e.g., IgG (+) turns IgM(+) in a month). Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 %, paralleling the rise of the cases in Tokyo. Among 152 seropositive participants, 74 participants underwent the follow-up test in Dec 2020. 40.5 % turned seronegative in four months (mean ± S.D. 120 ± 17 days). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> COVID-19 infection may have spread widely in Tokyo despite the low fatality. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the peak out of COVID-19 cases without a lockdown, temporary herd immunity might be achieved. However, the relatively short-lived antibodies among the asymptomatic individuals may explain why the herd immunity strategy has not succeeded, and COVID-19 resurgence happens every several months. Moreover, sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population level.",2021,,,,,,PPR354257,10.21203/rs.3.rs-564670/v1,,#124947,Hibino 2021,"",""

Three blood draws were performed at five clinical sites and tested for the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped particles (SARS-CoV-2pp) assay, and serum virus neutralization (SVN) assay. The seroprevalence was determined to be 1/336 (0.29%) for samples collected from 5/13/20-7/13/20, 5/260 (1.92%) for samples collected from 8/13/20-9/25/20, and 35/235 (14.89%) for samples collected from 10/16/20-12/22/20. Eight of the 35 (22.8%) seropositive individuals identified in the final draw did not report a previous diagnosis with COVID-19. There was a high correlation (>90%) among the FMIA and virus neutralization assays. Each clinical site’s seroprevalence was higher than the cumulative incidence for the general public in each respective county as reported by state public health agencies.

To guide public health policies, we aimed to describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population in Kinshasa., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, household-based serosurvey between October 22, 2020, and November 8, 2020. Participants were interviewed at home and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a Luminex based assay. A positive serology was defined as a sample that reacted with both SARS-CoV-2 proteins (100% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity). The overall weighted, age-standardized prevalence was estimated and the infection-to-case ratio was calculated to determine the proportion of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections., RESULTS: A total of 1233 participants from 292 households were included (mean age, 32.4 years; 764 [61.2%] were women). The overall weighted, age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 14.0-19.5). The estimated infection-to-case ratio was 292:1. Prevalence was higher among participants >= 40 years than among those <18 years (21.2% vs 14.9%, respectively; p<0.05). It was also higher in participants who reported hospitalization than among those who did not (29.8% vs 16.0%, respectively; p<0.05). However, differences were not significant in the multivariate model (p=0.1)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than the number of COVID-19 cases reported.

Seroprevalence of COVID-19 and associated factors in a medical institution in Pakistan.,"Naiyar, I; Anjum, A F; Khalid, A M; Noor, I; Abdullah, M S; Anwar, M Z","Objective: This study investigates the association of preventive measures with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seropositivity., Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Kharian Medical College, Pakistan, in September 2020. A total of 442 participants from three different strata (faculty, students, and administration/technical staff) were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique. A rapid antibody testing method was used to detect antibodies. The Ichroma TM COVID-19 Ab test is an in vitro diagnostic device that helps in the rapid identification of COVID-19 by measuring the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the blood. An automated fluorescent immunoassay system (AFIAS-6), with a clinical sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 96.7%, was used for qualitative analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25., Results: In total, 442 participants were included in the study: 40 (9%) faculty members, 299 (67%) students, and 103 (23.3%) administrative/technical staff. As many as 14.9% of the participants were symptomatic; 32.4% always used masks, and 14% never wore masks. Furthermore, 69.7% of participants frequently washed their hands for 20 s, and 75.6% were aware of social distancing. A total of 16.96% of participants tested positive for IgG antibodies. Moreover, most of the administration/technical staff who tested positive for IgG were asymptomatic (68.42%). A significant association (p < 0.001) was found between following the safety guidelines (wearing masks, handwashing, and social distancing) and the occurrence of COVID-19., Conclusion: This study showed a higher seroprevalence rate than other studies as it was conducted toward the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are still far from achieving herd immunity. Furthermore, strict compliance with preventive measures is the only way to ensure safety until an effective vaccine is developed.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was extremely limited early in the pandemic and likely led to under-reporting of cases leaving important gaps in our understanding of transmission and disease characteristics in the African context. SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and serologic response data could help quantify the burden of COVID-19 disease in Africa to address this knowledge gap and guide future outbreak response, adapted to the local context. However, such data are widely lacking in Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey among 1,192 individuals seeking COVID-19 screening and testing in central Cameroon using the Innovita antibody-based rapid diagnostic. Overall immunoglobulin prevalence was 32%, IgM prevalence was 20%, and IgG prevalence was 24%. IgM positivity gradually increased, peaking around symptom day 20. IgG positivity was similar, gradually increasing over the first 10 days of symptoms, then increasing rapidly to 30 days and beyond. These findings highlight the importance of diagnostic testing and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Cameroon, which likely resulted in artificially low case counts. Rapid antibody tests are a useful diagnostic modality for seroprevalence surveys and infection diagnosis starting 5-7 days after symptom onset. These results represent the first step towards better understanding the SARS-CoV-2 immunological response in African populations.

We compared demographic and contextual factors for seropositivity. <h4>Results</h4> Of 713 participants, 8.9% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, age, or race/ethnicity. Furthermore, firefighters who worked in zip codes with lower income or higher share of minority population did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity was highest among firefighters who reported working in the vicinity of Los Angeles International Airport, which had a known outbreak in July 2020. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Seroprevalence among firefighters was no higher than seroprevalence in the general population, suggesting that workplace safety protocols, such as access to PPE and testing, can mitigate increased risk of infection at work.

We compared seroprevalence to laboratory-confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths reported in the districts to calculate infection-case (ICR), infection-hospitalisation (IHR) and infection-fatality ratio (IFR) in the two waves of infection. <h4>Findings</h4> Seroprevalence after the second wave ranged from 18% (95%CrI 10-26%) and 28% (95%CrI 17-41%) in children <5 years to 37% (95%CrI 28-47%) in adults aged 19-34 years and 59% (95%CrI 49-68%) in adults aged 35-59 years in the rural and urban community respectively. Individuals infected in the second wave were more likely to be from the rural site (aOR 4.7, 95%CI 2.9-7.6), and 5-12 years (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.1-4.2) or ≥60 years (aOR 2.8, 95%CI 1.1-7.0), compared to 35-59 years. The in-hospital IFR in the urban site was significantly increased in the second wave 0.36% (95%CI 0.28-0.57%) compared to the first wave 0.17% (95%CI 0.15-0.20%). ICR ranged from 3.69% (95%CI 2.59-6.40%) in second wave at urban community, to 5.55% (95%CI 3.40-11.23%) in first wave in rural community. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The second wave was associated with a shift in age distribution of cases from individuals aged to 35-59 to individuals at the extremes of age, higher attack rates in the rural community and a higher IFR in the urban community. Approximately 95% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in these two communities were not reported to the national surveillance system, which has implications for contact tracing and infection containment. <h4>Funding</h4> US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of SARS-CoV-2 burden than laboratory-confirmed cases because many infections may be missed due to restricted access to care and testing, or differences in disease severity and health-care seeking behaviour. This underestimation may be amplified in African countries, where testing access may be limited. Seroprevalence data from sub-Saharan Africa are limited, and comparing seroprevalence estimates between countries can be challenging because populations studied and timing of the study relative to country-specific epidemics differs. During the first wave of infections in each country, seroprevalence was estimated at 4% in Kenya and 11% in Zambia. Seroprevalence estimates in South African blood donors is estimated to range between 32% to 63%. South Africa has experienced two waves of infection, with the emergence of the B.1.351/501Y.V2 variant of concern after the first wave. Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases may not be a true reflection of SARS-CoV-2 burden and specifically the differential impact of the first and second waves of infection. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We collected longitudinal blood samples from prospectively followed rural and urban communities, randomly selected, household cohorts in South Africa between July 2020 and March 2021. From 668 and 598 individuals included from the rural and urban communities, respectively, seroprevalence was found to be 7% (95%CrI 5-9%) and 27% (95%CrI 23-31%), after the first wave of infection, and 26% (95%CrI 22-29%) and 41% (95%CrI 37-45%) after the second wave, in rural and urban study districts, respectively. After standardising for age, we estimated that only 5% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were laboratory-confirmed and reported. Infection-hospitalisation ratios in the urban community were higher in the first (2.01%, 95%CI 1.57-2.57%) and second (2.29%, 95%CI 1.63-3.94%) wave than the rural community where there was a 0.75% (95%CI 0.49-1.41%) and 0.66% (95%CI 0.50-0.98%) infection-hospitalisation ratio in the first and second wave, respectively. When comparing the infection fatality ratios for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 waves, at the urban site, the ratios for both in-hospital and excess deaths to cases were significantly higher in the second wave (0.36%, 95%CI 0.28-0.57% in-hospital and 0.51%, 95%CI 0.34-0.93% excess deaths), compared to the first wave in-hospital (0.17%, 95%CI 0.15-0.20%) and excess (0.13%, 95%CI 0.10-0.17%) fatality ratios, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). In the rural community, the point estimates for infection-fatality ratios also increased in the second wave compared to the first wave for in-hospital deaths, 0.13% (95%CI 0.10-0.23%) first wave vs 0.20% (95%CI 0.13%-0.28%) second wave, and excess deaths (0.51%, 95%CI 0.30-1.06% vs 0.70%, 95%CI 0.49-1.12%), although neither change was statistically significant. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> In South Africa, the overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is substantially underestimated, resulting in many cases being undiagnosed and without the necessary public health action to isolate and trace contacts to prevent further transmission. There were more infections during the first wave in the urban community, and the second wave in the rural community. Although there were less infections during the second wave in the urban community, the infection-fatality ratios were significantly higher compared to the first wave. The lower infection-hospitalisation ratio and higher excess infection-fatality ratio in the rural community likely reflect differences in access to care or prevalence of risk factors for progression to severe disease in these two communities. In-hospital infection-fatality ratios for both communities during the first wave were comparable with what was experienced during the first wave in India (0.15%) for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed deaths. To our knowledge, these are the first longitudinal seroprevalence data from a sub-Saharan Africa cohort, and provide a more accurate understanding of the pandemic, allowing for serial comparisons of antibody responses in relation to reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections within diverse communities.",2021,,,,,,PPR349715,10.1101/2021.05.26.21257849,,#120450,Kleynhans 2021,"",""
SARS-Cov-2 viral and serological screening of staff in 31 European fertility units.,"Nelson, Scott M; Ehnert, Susanne; Gromski, Piotr S; Child, Tim; Trew, Geoffrey","STUDY QUESTION: What is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral presence and seroconversion in staff members in European fertility units prior to recommencement of clinical activity?, SUMMARY ANSWER: A large proportion of fertility clinic staff remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with no evidence of seroconversion, indicating that continued comprehensive risk mitigation strategies are essential., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, routine fertility treatment was temporarily stopped in several European countries. The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and seroconversion in fertility clinic staff, who are at potentially lower risk than routine healthcare workers, are unknown., STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: This cross-sectional study included 554 staff in 16 European IVF clinics, 13 ultrasound clinics, one diagnostic laboratory and one head office in four European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany and the UK) between 15 April and 30 June 2020., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: There were 554 staff members returning for resumption of clinical activity. Paired nucleic acid amplification tests of oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were performed., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the 554 staff members tested, 0.19% (95% CI 0.03, 1.10%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. In contrast, 23 staff members, i.e. 4.15% (95% CI 2.78, 6.15%), had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a wide range of antibody titres. There was no evidence of differences in seroconversion between countries with estimates ranging from 2.78% (95% CI 0.77, 9.58) in Austria to 6.75% (95% CI 4.46, 10.1) for the UK. There was no strong evidence of clustering within the clinics, with 21 of the 30 facilities having no staff members affected (prevalence estimates ranging from 0% to 35%), and one clinic having seven staff members affected (35% (95% CI 18.1%, 56.7%)). The single staff member who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus was in the pre-symptomatic phase and was isolated, with no contacts having evidence of infection on repeat testing., LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This was a cross-sectional study prior to resumption of clinical activity, with repeat testing not undertaken., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The low prevalence of seroconversion of fertility clinic staff highlights the need for continued comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and engagement with national endeavours to identify and isolate new cases and their contacts as we embark on the resumption of fertility services., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The Fertility Partnership funded the study.

However, robust data to support this from large-scale seroepidemiological studies are lacking. We report a longitudinal seroprevalence analysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, with baseline sampling prior to large-scale practice reopening in July 2020 and follow-up postimplementation of new public health guidance on infection prevention control (IPC) and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). In total, 1,507 West Midlands DCPs were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence was determined using a combined IgGAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the cohort followed longitudinally for 6 mo until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United Kingdom and vaccination commencement. Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3%, compared to estimates in the regional population of 6% to 7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3- and 6-mo follow-up and conferred a 75% reduced risk of infection. Nonwhite ethnicity and living in areas of greater deprivation were associated with increased baseline seroprevalence. During follow-up, no polymerase chain reaction-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. After vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in those individuals who were seropositive at baseline. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to enhanced PPE was significantly higher in DCPs than the regional population. Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 mo after initial sampling and 9 mo from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech 162b vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.",2021,/,Journal of dental research,,"hyv, 0354343",220345211020270,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00220345211020270,34077690,#119795,Shields 2021,"",""
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in South Korea.,"Lee, Kwangmin; Jo, Seongil; Lee, Jaeyong","In 2020, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported three rounds of surveys on seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in South Korea. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus which inflicts the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyze the seroprevalence surveys using a Bayesian method with an informative prior distribution on the seroprevalence parameter, and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. We construct the informative prior of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test using the posterior distribution obtained from the clinical evaluation data. The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed coronavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao's test can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders interval estimators with coverage probability close to the nominal level. As of the 30th of October 2020, the 95 % credible interval of the estimated SARS-CoV-2 positive population does not exceed 318, 685, approximately 0.62 % of the Korean population., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42952-021-00131-7.

"Isolation, behavioral changes and low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Rheumatoid arthritis.","Ammitzboll, Christian; Andersen, Jakob Bogh; Vils, Signe Risbol; Mistegaard, Clara Elbaek; Mikkelsen, Susan; Erikstrup, Christian; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Hauge, Ellen-Margrethe; Troldborg, Anne","OBJECTIVES: Patients with chronic rheumatic diseases (CRD), such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), require special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are considered at risk of severe infections. We assessed the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in patients with SLE and RA and patient behavior, disease-related symptoms, and mental health., METHODS: More than 900 participants were included: 405 patients with RA or SLE (CRD-patients) and 513 blood donors. All participants had blood SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies measured (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 99.5%) and answered a questionnaire concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). The CRD patients were further asked about physical activity, adherence to medication, and disease-related symptoms., RESULTS: CRD-patients had a significant lower seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=1/365, 0.3%) compared to blood donors (n=10/513, 1.9%) (p=0.03). Almost 60% of patients were unable to exercise as usual, increased pain was experienced by 34% of patients and increased disease activity by 24%. Almost 10% of patients reduced or discontinued their immunosuppressive treatments at their own initiative. Symptoms of moderate depression were present in 19% of patients compared to 6,8% blood donors (p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Low seroprevalence in patients with CRDs indicates successful mitigation of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, this appears to occur at the expense of physical activity, experience of increased pain, disease activity, and symptoms of depression. There is a need for care providers to be aware of these negative side-effects and for further studies to investigate the possible long-term consequences.

M.","Background We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. Methods Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. Results Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). Conclusions In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported.

METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering three risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and were sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULT(S): Overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1 to 29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5 to 18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5 to 13.8). Case-to-infection ratio 1:40, and infection fatality rate 0.05%. Influenza-like-symptoms or contact with COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatics compared to 47% asymptomatic. CONCLUSION(S): Our sentinel-based population survey is the first comprehensive survey to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden.

We aimed to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients with SLE with or without previous COVID-19-related symptoms or RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection., Methods: For this analysis, we included patients with SLE from two cohorts based in New York City: the Web-based Assessment of Autoimmune, Immune-Mediated and Rheumatic Patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (WARCOV) study; and the NYU Lupus Cohort (a prospective registry of patients at NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue). Patients in both cohorts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via commercially available immunoassays, processed through hospital or outpatient laboratories. Patients recruited from the NYU Lupus Cohort, referred from affiliated providers, or admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies as part of routine surveillance during follow-up clinical visits., Findings: 329 patients with SLE were included in this analysis, 146 from the WARCOV study and 183 from the NYU Lupus Cohort, and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between April 29, 2020, and Feb 9, 2021. 309 (94%) were women and 91 (28%) were of Hispanic ethnicity. 51 (16%) of 329 patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. Seropositive patients were more likely than seronegative patients to be Hispanic (24 [47%] of 51 vsz 67 [24%] of 278). Other demographic variables, SLE-specific factors, and immunosuppressant use were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Of the 29 patients with COVID-19 previously confirmed by RT-PCR, 18 (62%) were on immunosuppressants; 24 (83%) of 29 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Of 17 patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 but negative concurrent RT-PCR testing, one (6%) developed an antibody response. Of 26 patients who had COVID-19-related symptoms but did not undergo RT-PCR testing, six (23%) developed an antibody response. Of 83 patients who had no symptoms of COVID-19 and no RT-PCR testing, four (5%) developed an antibody response. Among 36 patients who were initially SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, the majority maintained reactivity serially (88% up to 10 weeks, 83% up to 20 weeks, and 80% up to 30 weeks). Seven (70%) of ten patients with confirmed COVID-19 had antibody positivity beyond 30 weeks from disease onset., Interpretation: Most patients with SLE and confirmed COVID-19 were able to produce and maintain a serological response despite the use of a variety of immunosuppressants, providing reassurance about the efficacy and durability of humoral immunity and possible protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2., Funding: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and Bloomberg Philanthropies COVID-19 Response Initiative Grant.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. Method(s): Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. Result(s): The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n = 3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81%-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95% CI 0.00%-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95% HDI 0.40%-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06% (95% HDI 2.97%-5.16%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95% HDI 3.18%-5.47%). Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,/,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,,"(Poljak, Ostrbenk Valencak, Maver Vodicar, Resman Rus, Korva, Knap, Seme, Petrovec, Avsic Zupanc) Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia(Strumbelj, Zupan, Demsar) Faculty of Computer and",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.03.009,2011834534,#119881,Poljak 2021,"",""

We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among people experiencing homelessness on a large city-wide scale in France, taking into account different community settings. <h4>Methods:</h4> A consortium of outreach teams in 48 different locations including streets, slums, squats, emergency or transitional shelters and drop-in centres participated in the inclusion process. All participants consented to receive a validated rapid assay for immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies and to answer a questionnaire on medical health conditions, comorbidities, historic of symptoms compatible with COVID-19, with a retrospective calendar of types of accommodation since COVID-19 crisis. <h4>Results:</h4> From June 01 to August 05, 2020, 1,156 homeless participants were enrolled in the study and tested. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies was 5.6% (95%CI 2.3&ndash;7.0), with a range of 2.2% in people living on the streets to 8.1% in people living in emergency shelters (P=0.009). Around one third of the seropositive participants reported symptoms with COVID-19. Compared to the general population in Marseille (3.6%), the homeless population living in the same urban area experienced an significant increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (|z|=3.65 &gt; 1.96). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> These results highlight the need for organizing regular screening to prevent clusters forming in homeless accommodations and for providing basic resources for health maintenance.",2021,,,,,,PPR350578,10.20944/preprints202105.0766.v1,,#120488,Loubière 2021,"",""

Studies have shown that Viral titres peak within the first week of symptoms but may decline later hampering RT-PCR-based diagnostic strategies. Exact estimate is difficult under high-risk screening strategy with evidences of having large number of asymptomatic cases. This has prompted a call for adoption of antibody testing as potential source of data., Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 7000 was conducted for 15 days including all the 85 wards under Indore Municipal Corporation. Stratified Random Sampling was used to collect the samples. Trained teams collected basic sociodemographic information and serum samples which were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to COVID-19 using ICMR-Kavach IgG ELISA kits. The data collected was compiled and analysed using appropriate statistical software., Results: Overall weighted seroprevalence of the study population was found to be 7.75%. The prevalence in males and females was comparable (7.91% vs 7.57%). Highest seropositivity (10.04%) was seen among individuals aged more than 60 years. Total number of infections in the population were estimated to be 2,03,160. Overall Case Infection Ratio was found to be 27.43., Conclusion: The current seroprevalence study provides information on proportion of the population exposed, but the correlation between presence and absence of antibodies is not a marker of total or partial immunity. It must also be noted that more than 90 percent of the population is still susceptible for COVID-19 infection. Hence, non-pharmaceutical interventions like respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, hand sanitization, usage of personal protective equipment such as masks and implementation of public health measures need to be continued.

Us population-based survey of vaccine willingness and sars-cov- 2 antibody prevalence,"Siegler, Aaron J.; Hall, Eric; Sanchez, Travis; Luisi, Nicole; Nelson, Kristen; Valentine-Graves, Mariah; Shioda, Kayoko; Lopman, Ben; Sullivan, Patrick S.; Bradley, Heather; Rothenberg, Rich; Fahimi, Mansour ","Background: Developing representative estimates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance will be essential to public health planning as the vaccine supply moves towards sufficiency in meeting initial levels of demand. We conducted a national probability household survey to assess vaccine willingness and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody response. Method(s): Study materials were sent to an address-based sample frame that includes nearly all residential addresses in the US. Participants completed a behavioral survey and dried blood spot (DBS) specimen collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing during the study period, August 9 - December 8, 2020. Vaccine willingness was measured with a 5-point Likert scale item with responses ranging from ""Very unlikely"" to ""Very likely."" Sample weights were calculated and applied to descriptive statistics and prevalence ratios (PR). We categorized persons as either Ig negative, Ig positive and aware of prior COVID-19 infection, or Ig positive and unaware of prior COVID-19 infection. Result(s): A total of 4,654 respondents completed the survey and had a valid antibody test result, representing 242,875,582 US adults. Overall, a substantial proportion, 32% (76,967,749 adults), were unsure or unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Many groups at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 had higher proportions unsure or unwilling, including Black (46%) relative to White (30%, p<.001) race, persons working outside home (38%) relative to at home (21%, p<.001), and smokers (44%) relative to nonsmokers (29%, p<.001) (Table 1). Dissonance between transmission risk and vaccine willingness was also observed in biologic data. Persons Ig positive (previously infected) and unaware of their status had a higher point estimate of unwillingness to be vaccinated (39%) than persons Ig negative with no history of infection (31%, p=.28). Overall, we estimate 12% (29,241,030 adults) were very unlikely to be vaccinated, 7% (15,729,748) were somewhat unlikely, 13% (31,996,971) were unsure, 19% (44,958,518) were likely, and 50% (119,820,865) were very likely. Conclusion(s): In the first national probability survey with biomarker data, we demonstrated that many groups with higher risk for COVID-19 infection had lower willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. This finding is in accordance with pre-existing fault-lines of inequity in our society. Substantial vaccine uptake promotion is needed, and should be targeted to address inequities correlated with vaccine willingness.",2021,/,Topics in Antiviral Medicine,29,1,247,,,635068892,#118851,Siegler 2021,"",""
COVID-19 gender difference pattern in Iranian population compared to the global pattern; a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Rajabinejad, Misagh; Asgarian-Omran, Hossein","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted Sex-related immune responses. In this review, gender differences in seroprevalence, severity, mortality, and recovery in the Iranian population were systematically compared to the COVID-19 global pattern. This compressive meta-analysis was conducted on studies published up to April 1, 2021, examining seroprevalence in the general population as well as disease outcomes in hospitalized patients. Data were analyzed based on gender to determine differences between men and women in COVID-19. The PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, WOS, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated based on the random-effects model, with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), according to the number of participants reported in papers. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the age, antibody isotype, and detection assay. Overall, 61 studies with 225799 males and 237017 females were eligible for meta-analysis. Seroprevalence was 1.13 times higher (95% CI: 1.03, 1.24), mortality was 1.45 times higher (95% CI: 1.19, 1.77), and severity was up to 1.37 times higher (95% CI: 1.13, 1.67) in males than those of females in the general population across the globe. Mortality was higher in Iranian patients up to 26% in men (95% CI: 1.20, 1.33), but no significant difference was observed between disease severity and serum prevalence between men and women. Besides, the rate of recovery was 29% (global pattern) and 21% (Iran pattern) lower in males than in females. The results of subgroup analyses for seroprevalence were not significant for the age, antibody isotype, and detection methods. The results of our meta-analyses showed that the patient mortality and recovery patterns are similar in Iran and other countries in the context of gender differences, and the disease is more fatal in men.",2021,,,,,,PPR345272,10.1101/2021.05.23.21257692,,#119260,Rajabinejad 2021,"",""

As nationally representative household surveys are a major undertaking, it will be important to find efficient ways to reliably estimate antibody prevalence from much simpler, less expensive protocols. Method(s): Subject to meeting standard blood donor eligibility criteria, and a standing opt-out arrangement for research use of specimens primarily obtained for blood safety screening, unsolicited blood donations, obtained on particular 'collection days' at 219 donation sites in South Africa, during January 2021, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Roche Cobas e411 platform. Donors are currently requested to defer donation if they were diagnosed with Covid-19, or experienced Covid-19-like symptoms, in the preceding 14 days. Estimates were stratified by age, sex and race. The study will have additional testing days. Phone interviews with both antibody positive and negative donors are being conducted to probe PCR diagnosis and symptoms. Result(s): Tested donations numbered 4547, from donors aged 16-81. Seroprevalence did not vary significantly between sexes or age groups. Headline results for the main race groups (in South African nomenclature) are: Black 58.3% (95% CI 55.8 - 60.7% ), White 13.8% (95% CI 12.3 -15.4%), Asian 23.4% (95% CI 19.4 - 27.7%) and Coloured 36.2%(95% CI 31.4 - 41.1%). The population group weighted overall national estimate is then 51.4% (95% CI 49.4 - 53.4%). This is almost 25 times as high as the official prevalence, on 10 January, of having been diagnosed with Covid-19, namely 2.1%. See Figure. Conclusion(s): These are the first relatively widely representative SARSCoV- 2 antibody prevalence estimates from South Africa. Population level representativeness of this methodology warrants further exploration - but it is worth noting that 1) as elsewhere, the obtained antibody prevalence estimates imply SARS-CoV-2 attack rates that are easily an order of magnitude higher than the apparently relatively uninformative official case counts; and 2) the marginal cost of performing this study, over the cost of routine blood bank operations, was almost entirely comprised of the cost of reagents.

Seroprevalence of antibodies against sars-cov-2 among people living with hiv (PLWH),"Gudipati, Smitha; Lee, Monica; Scott, Megan; Yaphe, Sean; Yared, Nicholas; Brar, Indira; Huisting, Joanne; Markowitz, Norman ","Background: COVID-19 first reported in the US on 1/2020 is a global pandemic. In PLWH, COVID-19 outcomes have been reported to be similar or worse compared to the general population; however, the seroprevalence in this group has not been identified. As of 6/2020, 2.7% of the 960 PLWH in our Ryan-White (RW) clinic have tested PCR+ for COVID-19. Yet, these likely represent only a fraction of COVID-19 infections, as an unknown proportion of cases are mild or asymptomatic and not diagnosed. Our goal was to estimate the seroprevalence in our RW patients (pts), irrespective of known past COVID-19 infection. The RW program funds HIV care for a diverse group impacted by a number of social determinants of health, including low socioeconomic status. Method(s): We conducted a seroprevalence study, which recruited pts in the RW program at Henry Ford Hospital. All RW pts were offered participation during clinic visits. After informed consent, pts completed a survey and had blood sampled for COVID-19 antibody using the Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Pts' electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic clinical features, including previous COVID-19 testing. The study was IRB approved. Result(s): 187 PLWH were enrolled from 9/2020-11/2020 (Table 1). Median age: 46 (IQR: 34-57); 153 males; 152 black; 24 reported a previous COVID-19 exposure; 66 had a BMI of >/= 30. Mean CD4 count was 629.5 (IQR: 390-859), and 129 pts were HIV suppressed. 17 had PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 16 reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but with unconfirmed diagnoses. Of 187 PLWH, 25 (13%) were COVID-19 IgG+ of whom 8 were previously PCR+. 9/17 PLWH who were PCR+ for COVID-19 were COVID-19 IgG negative at a mean of 7 months from the initial PCR test. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 seroprevalence of 13% reported in this study of PLWH in our clinic was about 5-fold greater than the number of reported cases by PCR+ in the same population. This estimate of past infection is also an underestimate given the absence of antibody at the time of the serological testing in 53% of PLWH with documented PCR+ infection and the likelihood of infection in some of those never tested. Conversely, the impact of health disparities on the RW pts likely increases the chance of acquisition of COVID-19 compared to other populations. In order to better understand the penentration of COVID-19 into the PLWH community, a greater understanding of the dynamics of the antibody response to COVID-19 is needed.",2021,/,Topics in Antiviral Medicine,29,1,243,,,635068826,#118840,Gudipati 2021,"",""
Front line provider risk for SARS-CoV- 2 over time in an urban county,"Salazar, Gilberto; Isaacs, Marshal; Diercks, Lauren; Martin, Riley; Mark Courtney, D.; Koruthu, Brittney; Benitez, Fernando; McDonald, Samuel A.; Diercks, Deborah B. ","Background and Objectives: In the early and even current stages of the COVID pandemic there was and continues to be uncertainty among frontline emergency care providers, their leaders, and health systems as to risk of developing SARS-CoV- 2. Despite use of PPE, this risk was thought to be high by many. The objective of this study of urban emergency medical services (EMS) and ED providers (HCP) was to measure over time new incident cases of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID. Method(s): Prospective cohort of EMS and HCP were enrolled June to August 2020. Participants were volunteers from local hospitals and EMS agencies. Self-reported exposures, symptoms, and prior testing were collected. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and IgG antibody testing was performed using Abbot IgG assay. Repeat testing was performed after 3 months. Descriptive statistics were used to report incidence of cases over the follow-up time period. Confidence intervals were presented. Stratified analysis was done by asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV- 2 infection was defined by the presence of IgG without documentation of a prior positive test. Result(s): The cohort comprised of 713 (552 EMS and 161 HCP). Median age 35 (IQR 31, 42) with 82% were male. Follow-up testing was complete in 549 (77%) individuals. The overall prevalence of diagnosed COVID-19 at enrollment occurred in 3.7% (95% CI 2.5-5.3%) 8 by PCR and 18 seropositive for IgG with 50% of these (95% CI 31.6-68.4%) reporting no prior symptoms. Of those who were asymptomatic in the initial test, 4 had previously tested positive. The incidence of new COVID infection was 56/549 (10.2%, 95% CI 7.9-13.0%). Of these 33/56 (60%, 95% CI 47-72%) were asymptomatic; 44/56 (79%) had antibodies; and 12/56 (21%) diagnosed by PCR alone. In those asymptomatic with COVID, 16/26 (61%) and 26/56 (46%) reported known exposure to COVID. There was no difference in the prevalence or incidence of infection between EMS and HCP. There was no significant difference between asymptomatic infection between prehospital and hospital providers. Of all the people tested 12 were IgG positive on the first and second tests. Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence at baseline of SARS-CoV- 2 amongst frontline providers was 3.7% with an increase in infected individuals to over 10% after 3 months.

Sars-cov-2 seroprevalence and igg levels are lower among people living with hiv,"Spinelli, Matthew; Lynch, Kara A.; Yun, Cassandra A.; Glidden, Dave; Peluso, Michael A.; Heinrich, Timothy A.; Gandhi, Monica; Brown, Lillian B. ","Background: Although data are mixed, most cohorts show a similar or lower COVID-19 incidence among people living with HIV (PLWH) compared to the general population. However, incidence may be impacted by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We compared SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and IgG levels, and disease severity, among patients with and without HIV receiving care within a county hospital system over a three-month period. Method(s): From August through October 2020, remnant serum samples were collected from all PLWH who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing at San Francisco General Hospital which houses a large HIV clinic (Ward 86). Patients with HIV were matched on time of collection (same day) and age (+/- 5 years) to 1-2 adults without HIV. SARS-CoV-2 levels of IgG levels was quantified in serum using the Pylon IgG assay (100% specificity on internal validation). Seroprevalence was compared by HIV status via conditional logit models, adjusting for sex. For those with reactive results, IgG levels were compared by HIV status using log-transformed generalized estimating equations. Severe disease, assessed via chart review, was defined as requiring oxygen. Result(s): Among 1,411 individuals (46% PLWH), the median age was 58 (IQR: 49-65), 64% were men. COVID-19 seroprevalence was 3.1% among PLWH compared to 6.8% among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.68, p<0.001). Among those with reactive COVID-19 IgG results (n=72, 20 in PLWH); antibody levels were 47% lower among PLWH (95% CI: 19-65% lower; p=0.003; Figure); however, there was a trend towards higher disease severity among PLWH [15% (n=3) vs. 4% (n=2); p=0.13]. Conclusion(s): Both seroprevalence, and absolute SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in those with reactive results, were lower among PLWH, within a time and agematched population of outpatients receiving routine laboratory testing in an urban hospital. PLWH may have had higher adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) than those without HIV, leading to lower COVID-19 seroprevalence and, possibly, lower COVID-19 IgG levels if infected with a lower viral inoculum due to NPIs. Alternatively, PLWH may mount lower antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B and yellow fever vaccines. Further studies of COVID-19 susceptibility and immunity are needed among PLWH. Moreover, PLWH should be enrolled in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies or followed after vaccination to ensure they mount sufficient humoral responses.",2021,/,Topics in Antiviral Medicine,29,1,242,,,635068812,#118838,Spinelli 2021,"",""
Serological study of healthcare workers in four different hospitals in Madrid (Spain) with no previous history of COVID-19.,"Vazquez Rivas, Fabian; Nieto Schwarz, Sandra; Villarreal Carreno, Jaime; Deschamps Perdomo, Ambar; Villanueva, Ghino Patricio; Garrafa, Mayra; Del Campo, M Teresa","OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been one of the most severely affected groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, though few studies have sought to determine the rate of undiagnosed cases among this population. In this study, we aim to determine the rate of undetected infection in HCWs, a potential source of nosocomial infection., METHODS: Serological screening for IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out among HCWs from four different hospitals in Madrid, Spain, from 6 April to 25 April 2020; HCWs with a previous diagnosis of infection based on real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay performed after presenting compatible symptoms were excluded. Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies was calculated among HCWs to obtain the rate of COVID-19 presence of antibodies in each hospital., RESULTS: Of the 7121 HCWs studied, 6344 (89.09%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 5995 HCWs finally participated in the study, resulting in a participation rate of 94.49%. A positive IgM or IgG test against COVID-19 was revealed in 16.21% of the HCWs studied (n=972)., CONCLUSION: This study reveals the importance of early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs to prevent nosocomial infection and exposure of patients, visitors and workers and the spread of COVID-19 in the overall community.

Method(s): We estimated the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and incidence rates of seroconversion in a national prospective online cohort of 6745 US adults, enrolled during March-July 2020. A subset (n=4459) underwent serologic testing (Bio-Rad Platelia Total Ab, IgA/IgM/IgG), offered initially during May-Sept. 2020 and again in Nov. 2020-Jan. 2021. Result(s): A total of 303 of 4459 individuals showed serologic evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (6.8%, 95%CI 6.1-7.6%). Among 3280 initially seronegative participants who had a subsequent serologic test, there were 145 seroconversions over 1562 person years of follow-up (incidence rate=9.3 per 100 person-years [95%CI 7.9-11.0]). Racial/ethnic disparities in crude incidence rates were apparent through Jan. 2021 (rate ratio [RRHispanic v White]=2.1, 95%CI 1.4-3.1; RRnon-Hispanic Black v White=1.8, 95%CI 0.96- 3.1). Incidence was higher in the southern (RRSouth v Northeast=1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.8) and midwest (RRmidwest v Northeast=1.6, 95%CI 0.98-2.7) regions, in rural v urban areas (RR=1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.2), and among essential workers (RR=1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.5). Household crowding (RR=1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.3), indoor restaurant dining (RR=2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.8), visiting places of worship (RR=2.0, 95%CI 1.3-2.9), wearing masks sometimes (v always) while grocery shopping (RR=2.5, 95%CI 1.3-4.4), not wearing masks when visiting people outside the household (RRsometimes v always=1.3, 95%CI 0.88-2.1; RRnever v always=2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.2), gathering in groups of >10 (RRindoors v never=1.74, 95%CI 1.2-2.5;RRoutdoors v never=1.8, 95%CI 1.3-4.3), and recent air travel (RR=1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.6) were associated with higher incidence. Among 303 seropositive persons, 27.4% had asymptomatic infections and 32% reported a positive SARSCoV- 2 PCR test or provider diagnosis. There were major gaps in the uptake of public health interventions aimed at isolation (31%) and contact tracing (asked about contacts [18%]; told about exposure to a case [7.6%]).

Method(s): We determined SARS-CoV-2 Ab in plasma samples collected from April 1st to September 30th, 2020, from enrollees in the Spanish HIV Research Network Cohort (CoRIS), a prospective national cohort of PWH, naive to ART at study entry, seen for the first time from January 1st, 2004. Samples were stored at-80degreeC in the Spanish HIV BioBank, and serology was performed using the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab assays (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Illness severity (NIH criteria) was assessed by medical records review and, if needed, participant interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of seropositivity among the following variables: sex, age, country of birth, education level, comorbidities (hypertension, chronic heart disease, diabetes, non-AIDS related cancer, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis), route of HIV acquisition, prior AIDS, CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load, and N(t)RTI backbone. Result(s): During the study period, blood samples were collected and stored in the HIV BioBank from 1,076 consecutive PWH in CoRIS: 88.0% male at birth, median age 43 yr., 72.3% MSM, 97.7% on ART, median CD4+ 688 cells/mm3, 91.4% undetectable HIV viral load. SARS-CoV-2 Ab were detected in 91 PWH, for a seroprevalence of 8.5% (95%CI: 6.9%-10.3%). A total of 41 PWH (45.0%) had asymptomatic infections; the disease was mild in 43 (47.3%), moderate in 4 (4.4%), severe in 3 (3.3%), and 0 critical. Seven PWH (7.7%) were hospitalized. COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR in 22 (24.2%) PWH. Variables independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were birth in Latin American (LA) Countries vs. Spain (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.42-3.85; P=.001); arterial hypertension (aOR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.00-2.67; P=.050); and therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) vs tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC as the N(t)RTI backbone (aOR: 0.32, 95%CI: 0.12-0.84; P=.021). (Table). Conclusion(s): A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections among PWH were asymptomatic. Birth in LA-countries and arterial hypertension were associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Our analysis, adjusted by comorbidities and other variables, suggest that TDF/FTC may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among PWH.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, retained sensitivity over time is an important quality in an antibody assay that is to be used for the purpose of population seroprevalence studies. We compared 5788 healthcare worker (HCW) serum samples on two serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG and Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid Total Antibody) and a subset of samples (all Abbott assay positive or grayzone, n=485) on Wantai SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike Antibody ELISA. For 367 samples from HCW with previous PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection we correlated the timing of infection with assay results. Overall seroprevalence was 4.2% on Abbott, 9.5% on Roche. Of those with previously confirmed infection, 41% (150/367) and 95% (348/367) tested positive on Abbott and Roche respectively. At 21 weeks (150 days) after confirmed infection, positivity on Abbott started to decline. Roche positivity was retained for the entire study period (33 weeks). Factors associated ( P ≤ 0.050) with Abbott seronegativity in those with previous PCR-confirmed infection included sex (male OR0.30;95%CI0.15-0.60), symptom severity (OR0.19 severe symptoms;95%CI0.05-0.61), ethnicity (OR0.28 Asian ethnicity;95%CI0.12-0.60) and time since PCR diagnosis (OR2.06 for infection 6 months previously;95%CI1.01-4.30. Wantai detected all previously confirmed infections. In our population, Roche detected antibodies up to at least seven months after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. This may indicate that Roche is better suited than Abbott to population-based studies. Wantai demonstrated high sensitivity but sample selection was biased. The relationship between serological response and functional immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be delineated.",2021,,,,,,PPR347943,10.1101/2021.05.25.21257772,,#119272,Allen 2021,"",""

We hypothesize that Childcare providers will have a high rate anxiety due to this uncertainty and this will level will decrease with testing for SARS-CoV- 2 and antibodies. Method(s): Prospective cohort of childcare providers at a city funded center focusing on homeless children was enrolled October 2020. Self-reported exposures, symptoms, and prior testing were collected. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and IgG antibody testing was performed using Abbot IgG assay. Repeat testing was performed after 6 weeks. All participants completed a Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) prior to each testing. This score has psychological and somatic questions. Standard scoring was used to determine normal (20-44), mild-moderate (45-59), marked to severe (60-74) and extreme anxiety (75-80). Descriptive statistics were used to report incidence of cases over the follow-up time period and difference in SAS scores. Unknown infection was defined by the presence of IgG without documentation of a prior positive test. Result(s): he cohort comprised of 37 childcare providers. Median age was 49 (IQR 24, 56) with 89 percent women. Follow-up testing was complete in 33 providers. 3 had terminated their employment and 1 was not available for repeat testing.

Cross-sectional studies have provided variable rates of seroprevalence in HCWs. Longitudinal assessments of the serological response to Covid-19 among HCWs are crucial to understanding the risk of infection and changes in antibody titers over time. We aimed to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors associated with seroconversion in a prospective cohort of HCWs during the peak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic., METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study among 446 front-line HCWsin a tertiary-care hospital in Chile from April to July 2020. IgG was determined monthly using two different ELISAs in serum samples of HCWs, during the three-month period. In each visit, demographic data, symptoms, risk factors, and exposure risks were also assessed., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence at the end of the study period was 24% (95% CI20.2-28.3), with 43% of seropositive HCWs reporting no prior symptoms. Seroconversion rates significantly differed over the study period, from 2.1% to as high as 8.8% at the peak of the epidemic.

We conducted a seroprevalence survey (SPS) to determine a more comprehensive prevalence of past COVID-19 in Los Angeles County SNF residents and staff members., METHODS: We recruited participants from 24 facilities; participants were requested to submit a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR testing and serum for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All participants were cross-referenced with our surveillance database to identify persons with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 results., RESULTS: From August 18 to September 24, 2020, we enrolled 3,305 participants (1,340 residents and 1,965 staff members). Among 856 residents providing serum, 362 (42%) had current/past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 346 serology positive residents, 199 (58%) did not have a documented prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. Among 1,806 staff members providing serum, 454 (25%) had current/past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 447 serology positive staff members, 353 (79%) did not have a documented prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result., CONCLUSIONS: Past testing practices and policies missed a substantial number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in SNF residents and staff members.

They experience higher transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2, and the extent, duration and pattern of antibody response remains under examined. The correlates of serological patterns are also unclear. We examined longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 sero-patterns and their correlates among a cohort of HCW. Method(s): HCWs (N=465) were recruited at a large quaternary medical center in New York City and followed prospectively with bi-monthly assessments of the following; demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure in the work, home and community settings, and molecular and antibody COVID-19 laboratory tests including quantitative measurements of antibody titers. Baseline and longitudinal patterns in antibody response and titers over the first 4 months were used to characterize HCW who remained persistently seronegative, seropositive, those who acquired and lost seropositvity and those with variable seropositivity. Chi-square test for the association of seropattern correlates and loess regression was used to examine longitudinal trends. Result(s): Baseline seropositivity was 32.6% (N=148/465), 34.6% (N=153/441) at month 2 and 38.3% (N=125/326) by month 4. Exactly 63.9%, 27.3%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 5.7% of HCW tested overall were persistently seronegative, persistently seropositive, became positive after baseline, lost seropositivity and had variable positivity, respectively. Among seropositive HCW, mean antibody levels increased from 53.7 at baseline to 69.8 at month 2 and 82.9 at month 4 (figure 1). Factors significantly associated with being ever seropositive were, history of prior COVID-19 testing, household member testing COVID-19 positive, whether there were other essential employees in the home, and history or current symptoms. We also observed an association with contact of suspected or confirmed co-worker as significantly higher among HCW who were persistently positive (24.5%), incident seropositives (33.3%) and variable seropositivity (52.2%) than those who were persistently negative (19.9%) or lost seropositivity (16.7%). Conclusion(s): HCWs exposure risks continue to persist in the workplace and in the home. We observed few positive molecular tests, suggesting few transmission, but these exposure may potentially sustain seropositivity. These findings are preliminary and need to be further investigated.",2021,/,Topics in Antiviral Medicine,29,1,243,,,635068835,#118841,Castor 2021,"",""
"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 of IgG antibody by ELISA: Community-based, cross-sectional study from urban area of Malegaon, Maharashtra.","Saple, Pallavi; Gosavi, Shriram; Pawar, Tushar; Chaudhari, Govind; Mahale, Hitesh; Deshmukh, Pradeep; Kurundkar, Ashish; Pedgaonkar, Sarang; Thakare, Sapana","Background: Given the high incidence of asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported cases likely underestimate the overall prevalence and infectivity of COVID-19. Serological test for IgG can provide a better measure of disease activity by identifying asymptomatic or subclinical infection. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hotspot area of COVID-19., Method: It was a community-based, cross-sectional study using multistage sampling with a sample size of 360. After informed consent, the demographic information, past history of SARI/ILI, contact, COVID-19 status were collected. The blood samples were taken from one family member for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody by ELISA testing kit., Results: Majority of the study subjects had no history of SARI (86%) or any contact with COVID-19 case (98%). Overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 of IgG antibody was 40% (95% CI 35-45%), infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.7%. Seroprevalence varied significantly depending on religious background; with Muslims (53%) seroprevalence compared to other religious groups. Seroprevalence of homemaker/unemployed (49%) and laborer (55%) was significantly higher compared to business (30%) and service occupation (21%). Subjects with overcrowding conditions and poor ventilation was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence with odds ratio of 2.5 and 2.3, respectively., Conclusion: The antibody testing detects a large number of asymptomatic cases or previously infected cases which would have been missed by clinical history. Thus, the number of undiagnosed cases was found significantly higher even with rigorous implementation of lockdown.

Strategies to identify household contacts who should be isolated around index children that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 remain to be clarified. We aimed to compare contact tracing strategies around an index child positive for SARS-CoV-2 using serological rapid diagnostic testing (RDT, chromatography immunoassay). Methods: We conducted a contact tracing study in households of index cases children in the Paris region, France, between May 8 and July 27, 2020. We compared two strategies, one using SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one combining RT-PCR and serological RDT, initiated once RDT was available. The contacts RT-PCR-/RDT+ were considered to have been previously infected and not requiring quarantine. The primary outcome was the proportion of contacts that could avoid quarantine with the two screening strategies. Results: We included 34 children as index cases. Median age was 7 years. They generated 184 contacts (111 adults, 73 children) tested by RT-PCR: 24/184 (13%) were positive. The strategy combining RDT and RT-PCR was performed in 120/184 contacts (77 adults, 43 children) of 26 index children: 16/120 (13%) were RT-PCR+ and 47/120 (39%) were RDT+. Among the 16 individuals who were RT-PCR+, 14 (87%) were also RDT+. Among the 104 individuals who were RT-PCR-, 33 were RDT+. Hence 33/120 (27%) individuals were not isolated. Conclusions: Following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, a strategy combining serological RDT and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR enabled us to identify around one fourth of contacts with past infection and avoid unnecessary quarantine of these individuals.

We aimed to review and characterize SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies conducted using blood donors to investigate methodology and provide guidance for future research. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed and preprint publications between January 2020 to January 2021. Two reviewers used standardized forms to extract seroprevalence estimates and data on methodology pertaining to population sampling, periodicity, assay characteristics and antibody kinetics. National data on cumulative incidence and social distancing policies were extracted from publicly available sources and summarized. <h4>Results</h4> Thirty-three studies representing 1,323,307 blood donations from 20 countries worldwide were included (sample size per study ranged from 22 to 953,926 donations). Seroprevalence rates ranged from 0% to 76% (after adjusting for waning antibodies).

We sought to determine the prevalence and temporal trends of acute (by PCR) and convalescent (by antibody [Ab]) SARS-CoV-2 infection during the earliest phase of the pandemic among patients in an urban ED in Baltimore City., METHODS: We tested remnant blood samples from 3255 unique ED patients, collected between March 16th and May 31st 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 Ab. PCR for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained on any patients based on clinical suspicion. Hospital records were abstracted and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed., RESULTS: Of 3255 ED patients, 8.2% (95%CI: 7.3%, 9.2%) individuals had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 155 PCR+, 78 Ab+, and 35 who were both PCR+ and Ab+. Prevalence of disease increased throughout the study period, ranging from 3.2% (95%CI: 1.8%, 5.2%) PCR+ and 0.6% (95%CI: 0.1%, 1.8%) Ab+ in March, to 6.2% (95%CI: 5.1%, 7.4%) PCR+ and 4.2% (95%CI: 3.3%, 5.3%) Ab+ in May.

The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses., Results: The 18148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods. Their median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-56) years, 12170 (67.1%) were women, 900 (5.0%) were seropositive, 4498 (24.8%) had a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, and 10876 (59.9%) had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before the pandemic. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking status, and geographical location, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL before (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22) or during (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.09) the pandemic; it was also not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.93-1.27) or during (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91-1.23) the pandemic.

Using PCR nucleic acid-based amplification (NAAT) methods, the period prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.23 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.01 %-1.28 %; 1/439) from 5/21/20-7/16/20. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from June 17-July 24, 2020 was 2.41 % (95 % CI 1.27 %-4.51 %; 9/374). Those who were reactive were younger (median age 36 versus 44 years; p = 0.050), and those with self-reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity had a higher seroprevalence (2/12 = 16.7 % versus 7/352 = 2.0 %; p = 0.051). There were no significant differences by sex, race, residence, hospital, unit or job type. The one employee who was found to be PCR test positive in this study was also reactive for IgG antibodies, tested 27 days later., CONCLUSIONS: The period prevalence of PCR positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and IgG seroprevalence was unexpectedly low in asymptomatic HCWs after a peak in COVID-19 admissions and the establishment of state and institutional infection control policies, suggesting that routine screening tests while community prevalence is relatively low would produce a minimal yield.

Using data from the Virus Watch community cohort study in England and Wales, we set out to estimate the total effect of occupation on SARS-CoV-2 serological status, whether this is mediated by frequency of close contact within the workplace, and how exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces varied across occupations. <h4>Methods</h4> We used data from a sub-cohort (n =3761) of adults (≥18) tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies between 01 February-28 April 2021 and responded to a questionnaire about work during the pandemic. Anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were used as a proxy of prior natural infection with COVID-19. We used logistic decomposition to estimate the total and direct effect of occupation and indirect effect of workplace contact frequency on odds of seropositivity, adjusting for age, sex, household income and region. We investigated the relationship between occupation and exposure to poorly-ventilated workplace environments using ordinal logistic regression. <h4>Results</h4> Seropositivity was 16.0% (113/707) amongst workers with daily close contact, compared to 12.9% (120/933) for those with intermediate-frequency contact and 9.6% (203/2121) for those with no work-related close contact. Healthcare (OR= 2.14, 95% CI 1.47,3.12), indoor trade, process and plant (2.09, 1.31,3.33), leisure and personal service (1.96, 1.004,3.84), and transport and mobile machine (2.17, 1.12,4.18) workers had elevated total odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared to other professional and associate occupations. Frequency of workplace contact accounted for a variable part of the increased odds in different occupational groups (OR range 1.04 [1.0004,1.07] - 1.22 [1.07, 1.38]). Healthcare workers and indoor trades and process plant workers continued to have raised odds of infection after accounting for work-related contact, and also had had greater odds of frequent exposure to poorly-ventilated workplaces (respectively 2.15 [1.66, 2.79] and (1.51, [1.12, 2.04]). <h4>Discussion</h4> Marked variations in occupational odds of seropositivity remain after accounting for age, sex, region, and household income.

One of the most pressing is how should hospital systems that rely on graduate medical residents provide appropriate care for patients while protecting trainees. This question is of particular concern as healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Objective: This cross-sectional study sought to assess the impact of hospital COVID-19 patient placement on pediatric graduate medical residents by comparing rates of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rates of residents who worked on designated COVID-19 teams and those who did not. Methods: Forty-four pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents at Riley Children's Hospital (Indianapolis, IN) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG seroconversion in May 2020 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Abnova catalog no. KA5826), 2 months after the first known COVID-19 case in Indiana. These residents were divided into two groups: those residents who worked on designated COVID-19 teams, and those who did not. Groups were compared using chi2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and continuous variables were compared using Student t testing. Results: Forty-four of 104 eligible residents participated in this study. Despite high rates of seroconversion, there was no difference in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion between residents who worked on designated COVID-19 teams (26% or 8/31) and those who did not (31% or 4/13). Eleven of 44 residents (25%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, whereas only 5/44 (11.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, without a detectable difference between exposure groups. Conclusion:  We did not observe a difference in SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion between different exposure groups. These data are consistent with growing evidence supporting the efficacy of personal protective equipment. Further population-based research on the role of children in transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus is needed to allow for a more evidence-based approach toward managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seropositivity among HCWs was estimated and compared with various demographic & other factors to understand their infection & immunity status. Proportions and Z-test were used as appropriate., Results: As on August'20, Seropositivity among HCWs from Ahmedabad is 23.65% (95% Confidence Interval 21.70-25.73%). Seropositivity of 25.98% (95%CI 23.47-28.66) among female HCWs is significantly higher than 19.48% (95%CI 16.53-22.80) among male HCWs. The zone wise positivity among HCWs closely correlate with cases reported from the respective zone. The sero-positivity among HCWs from the earliest and worst affected zones have lower level of seropositivity as compared to the zones affected recently. This might be pointing towards the fact that the IgG Antibodies may not be long lasting., Conclusion: As on August 2020, the seropositivity of 23.65% in HCWs indicate high level of disease transmission and higher risk of infection among HCWs in Ahmedabad. The seropositivity is significantly higher among female HCWs. Zone wise seropositivity, closely correlate with the reported cases from the respective zone.

Strict lockdowns have not been enforced, potentially affecting viral dissemination. To understand the levels of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n = 5,100) were sampled at random between 14 March 2020 and 28 February 2021., METHODS: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n = 2,600) and pregnant women (n = 2,500) were sampled for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) throughout the study period. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical (negative) controls (n = 595) were screened for IgG responses against stabilized trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyse data over time., SETTING: Healthy participant samples were randomly selected from their respective pools through Karolinska University Hospital. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807., PARTICIPANTS: No participants were symptomatic at sampling, and blood donors were all over the age of 18. No additional metadata were available from the participants., RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020.

Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR=0.5, 95%-CI: 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR=0.4, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR=0.3, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.6), and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95%-CI: 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR=2.7, 95%-CI: 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.2-2.9), and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.4-3.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCW. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

We set out to estimate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections eight months into the epidemic in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: We conducted a population based cross-sectional survey using multi-stage random sampling to select households within Nairobi in November 2020. Sera from consenting household members were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated after adjusting for population structure and test performance. Risk factors were determined using logistic regression and Infection fatality ratios (IFRs) calculated by comparing our estimates to reported cases and deaths. Findings: Of 1,164 individuals from 527 households tested, the adjusted seroprevalence was 34&middot;7% (95%CI 31&middot;8-37&middot;6), indicating that approximately 1&middot;5 million Nairobi residents had been infected. Some 261 (49&middot;5%) households had at least one positive participant, and positivity rates increased in more densely populated areas (spearman&rsquo;s r=0&middot;63; p=0&middot;009). Individuals aged 20-59 years had up to 2-fold higher seropositivity when compared to those aged 0-9 years or &ge;60 years. The IFR was 40 per 100,000 infections, with individuals &ge;40 years old having higher IFRs. Interpretation: Over one third of Nairobi residents in half of the households were infected by November 2020, indicating extensive transmission in the city, comparable to countries reporting more severe forms of the pandemic. However, the IFR was &amp;gt;10-fold lower than that reported in Europe and the United States, supporting the perceived low morbidity and mortality in sub&ndash;Saharan Africa.

Predictors of SARS CoV-2 Infection Among Healthcare Workers: The Impact of Community-Hospital Gradient,"Pınarlık, Fatihan; Genç, Zeliha; Tekin, Süda; Kapmaz, Mahir; Ergönül, Önder","<h4>Aim</h4> We aimed to detect the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) in 2020, before vaccination era. <h4>Methods</h4> We surveyed the SARS-CoV-2 infection among the HCWs in a hospital by screening of antibody levels and detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between May 2020 to December 2020. Occupational and non-occupational potential predictors of disease were surveyed for the HCWs included in this study. <h4>Results</h4> Among 1925 personnel in the hospital, 1732 were included to the study with the response rate of 90%. Overall seroprevalence was 15% at the end of 2020, before vaccinations started. In multivariate analysis, being janitorial staff (OR:2.24, CI:1.21-4.14, p=0.011), being medical secretary (OR: 4.17, CI: 2.12-8.18, p<0.001), having at least one household member with COVID-19 diagnosis (OR:8.98, CI: 6.64-12.15, p<0.001) and number of household members >3 (OR:1.67, CI:1.26-2.22, p<0.001) were found to be significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Conclusion</h4> By the end of 2020, just before the era of vaccination and variants, seroprevalence was 15% among HCWs. Medical secretary and janitorial staff were under increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Community-hospital gradient can explain the mode of transmission for infection among HCWs. In the setting of this study, community measures were less strict, whereas hospital infection control was adequate and provided necessary personal protective equipment.

Here, we analyze the relationship between educational, occupational, and housing variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 988 pregnant women in Spain. Pregnant women were recruited at the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain, among those delivering from 23 March 2020 onwards or consulting for their 12th week of pregnancy from 26 May 2020 onwards. Information on occupational variables and housing characteristics was self-reported. Pregnant women were tested for a current or past infection of SARS-CoV-2 using both PCR and antibodies detection (ELISA). Logistic regression models were used to analyze factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, adjusting for age and country of origin. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with educational level or occupational variables, except for where the pregnant woman was a healthcare worker (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-9.79). Housing with four or more rooms (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 0.96-4.47), four or more people in the household (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.89-4.14), lack of heating (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.24-6.34) and less than 23 square meters per person (OR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.43-11.1) were the housing characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and IgG concentration and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres after infection, compared by HIV status: a matched case-control observational study.","Spinelli, Matthew A; Lynch, Kara L; Yun, Cassandra; Glidden, David V; Peluso, Michael J; Henrich, Timothy J; Gandhi, Monica; Brown, Lillian B","BACKGROUND: Most cohorts show similar or lower COVID-19 incidence among people living with HIV compared with the general population. However, incidence might be affected by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralising antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care in a county hospital system over a 3-month period., METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (+/-5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity were measured in serum of participants with previous positive PCR tests and compared with multivariable mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and time since PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection., FINDINGS: 1138 samples from 955 people living with HIV and 1118 samples from 1062 people without HIV were tested. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 3.7% (95% CI 2.4 to 5.0) among people with HIV compared with 7.4% (5.7 to 9.2) among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83). Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 5.52 (95% CI 1.01 to 64.48) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change -53%, 95% CI -4 to -76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (-67%, -25 to -86), and avidity was similar (7%, -73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV., INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection., FUNDING: US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of Health.

To detect pre-symptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks.

Dramatic rise in seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors: The evolution of a pandemic,"Sughayer, Maher A.; Al Nuirat, Abeer; Souan, Lina; Ghanem, Mohammad; Siag, Mahmoud; Mansour, Asem ","Background: Seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are useful in assessing the epidemiological status in the community, and the degree of spread. Objective(s): To study the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan, at various points of time and as the pandemic evolves in the community. Method(s): In total, 1374 blood donor samples, from three groups, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin antibodies. In the first group, samples from 734 individuals (from donations made between January and June 2020) were tested in June. In the second group, 348 individuals were tested in September 2020. The third group of 292 individuals was tested in February 2021. A qualitative assay was used for testing (specificity 99.8%, sensitivity 100%). Result(s): The first two groups, from January-June and September 2020, when confirmed Covid-19 cases numbered between several hundred and 3000, showed a seroprevalence rate of 0% (95% CI 0.00-0.51%). The third group (early February 2021), when the number of confirmed cases had reached 100 times that of September 2020, revealed a seroprevalence of 27.4% (95% CI 22.5-32.9%). Conclusion(s): A dramatic rise in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was seen among healthy blood donors in Jordan, in parallel with widespread intracommunity transmission of the disease. This information is useful for assessing the degree of herd immunity, and provides for better understanding of the pandemic.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,/,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,107,"(Sughayer, Al Nuirat, Souan, Ghanem, Siag) Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan(Mansour) Department of Radiology, and CEO, King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan",116-120,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.059,2011979321,#110349,Sughayer 2021,"",""

We assessed four assays using various methodological approaches to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence during the first COVID-19 wave in Canada. <h4>Methods</h4> This serial cross-sectional study was conducted using plasma samples from healthy blood donors between April-September 2020. Qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was based on four assays: Abbott Architect SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay (target nucleocapsid) (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (target spike glycoprotein (Spike), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP)). Seroprevalence was estimated using multiple composite reference standards (CRS) and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models (BLCM) (using uninformative, weakly, and informative priors). <h4>Results</h4> 8999 blood samples were tested. The Abbott-NP assay consistently estimated seroprevalence to be lower than the ELISA-based assays. Discordance between assays was common, 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes were observed. Only 32 samples (0.4%) were positive by all four assays. BLCM using uninformative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7% (95% credible interval (CrI); 0.4, 1.0%) in April/May to 0.8% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.2%) in June/July to 1.1% (95% CrI 0.7, 1.6) in August/September. Results from CRS were very similar to the BLCM. Assay characteristics varied considerably over time. Overall spike had the highest sensitivity (89.1% (95% CrI 79.2, 96.9%), while the sensitivity of the Abbott-NP assay waned from 65.3% (95% CrI 43.6, 85.0%) in April/May to 45.9% (95% CrI 27.8, 65.6) by August/September. <h4>Discussion</h4> We found low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates at the end of the first wave and estimates derived from single assays may be biased. <h4>Summary</h4> Multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays are available, but no gold standard exists. We used four unique assays to estimate very low SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence during the first COVID-19 wave in Canada.

One of the challenges in overcoming the influx of COVID-19 patients is controlling patient-to-staff transmission. Measuring the specific extent of ICU caregiver exposure to the virus and identifying the associated risk factors are, therefore, critical issues. We prospectively studied SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the staff of a hospital in Lyon, France, several weeks after a first epidemic wave. Risk factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified using a questionnaire survey., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 9% (87/971 subjects). Greater exposure was associated with higher seroprevalence, with a rate of 3.2% [95% CI 1.1-5.2%] among non-healthcare staff, 11.3% [8.9-13.7%] among all healthcare staff, and 16.3% [12.3-20.2%] among healthcare staff in COVID-19 units. The seroprevalence was dramatically lower (3.7% [1.0-6.7%]) in the COVID-19 ICU. Risk factors for seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-confirmed household (odds ratio (OR), 3.7 [1.8-7.4]), working in a COVID-19 unit (OR, 3.5 [2.2-5.7], and contact with a confirmed COVID-19 coworker (OR, 1.9 [1.2-3.1]). Conversely, working in the COVID-19-ICU was negatively associated with seropositivity (OR, 0.33 [0.15-0.73])., CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among staff than in the general population.

Post-outbreak serological screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers at a Swedish University Hospital.,"Strand, Rasmus; Fernstrom, Nils; Holmberg, Anna; De Marinis, Yang; Fraenkel, Carl-Johan; Rasmussen, Magnus","BACKGROUND: Nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can have devastating consequences from both a resource cost and patient healthcare perspective. Relying on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identifying infected individuals may result in missed cases. Screening for antibodies after an outbreak can help to find missed cases and better illuminate routes of transmission., METHODS: In this study, we present the results of a serological screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) on a ward for infectious diseases in Sweden with a point-of-care antibody test 8 weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. In all, 107/123 (87%) of HCWs who were tested with RT-PCR in the outbreak investigation participated in this study on seroprevalence. Participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire entailing epidemiological data. The cohort was stratified by RT-PCR result and the resulting groups were compared to each other., RESULTS: Six (8%) HCWs who were tested RT-PCR negative during the outbreak investigation had developed specific IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These HCWs had all worked shifts with colleagues who later were tested RT-PCR positive during the outbreak., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a serological follow-up screening after an outbreak may be used as a complement to virus detection in an outbreak situation.

A study was conducted across three hospital sites in a large central London NHS Trust in the UK, to evaluate the prevalence and duration of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in healthcare workers. Methods: A matrix equivalence study consisting of 228 participants was undertaken to evaluate the Abbott Panbio TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device. Subsequently, 2001 evaluable healthcare workers (HCW), representing a diverse population, were enrolled in a HCW study between June and August 2020. A plasma sample from each HCW was evaluated using the Abbott Panbio TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device, with confirmation of IgG-positive results by the Abbott ArchitectTM SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. 545 participants, of whom 399 were antibody positive at enrolment, were followed up at 3 months. Results: The Panbio TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device demonstrated a high concordance with laboratory tests. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 506 participants (25.3%) at enrolment, with a higher prevalence in COVID-19 frontline (28.3%) than non-frontline (19.9%) staff. At follow-up, 274/399 antibody positive participants (68.7%) retained antibodies; 4/146 participants negative at enrolment (2.7%) had seroconverted. Non-white ethnicity, older age, hypertension and COVID-19 symptoms were independent predictors of higher antibody levels (OR 1.881, 2.422-3.034, 2.128, and 1.869 respectively), based on Architect TM index quartiles; participants in the first three categories also showed a greater antibody persistence at 3 months. Conclusion:  The SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positivity rate among healthcare staff was high, declining by 31.3% during the 3-month follow-up interval.

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020., METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13-18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13-18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics., FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67-73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62-70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61-68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1-3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18-29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 0.85 [95% CI 0.73-0.98]; p=0.029)., INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates., FUNDING: Direccion Regional de Salud de Loreto (DIRESA), Loreto, Peru., TRANSLATION: For the Spanish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

Limited data exist linking household overcrowding and risk of COVID-19. We used data collected from the Virus Watch cohort to examine the association between overcrowded households and SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Methods</h4> The Virus Watch study is a household community cohort of acute respiratory infections in England & Wales that began recruitment in June 2020. We calculated the persons per room for each household and classified accommodation as overcrowded when the number of rooms□was fewer than the number of people. We considered two primary outcomes - PCR-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Roche Elecsys anti-N total immunoglobulin assay). We used mixed effects logistic regression models that accounted for household structure to estimate the association between household overcrowding and SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Results</h4> The proportion of participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was highest in the overcrowded group (6.6%; 73/1,102) and lowest in the under-occupied group (2.9%; 682/23,219). In a mixed effects logistic regression model that included age, sex, ethnicity, household income and geographical region, we found strong evidence of an increased odds of having a positive PCR SARS-CoV-2 antigen result (Odds Ratio 3.72; 95% CI: 1.92, 7.13; p-value < 0.001) and increased odds of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result in individuals living in overcrowded houses (2.96; 95% CI: 1.13, 7.74; p-value =0.027) compared to people living in under-occupied houses. The proportion of variation at the household level was 9.91% and 9.97% in the PCR and antibody models respectively. <h4>Discussion</h4> Public health interventions to prevent and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 should consider the much greater risk of infection for people living in overcrowded households and pay greater attention to reducing household transmission. There is an urgent need to better recognise housing as a leading determinant of health in the context of a pandemic and beyond.",2021,,,,,,PPR338732,10.1101/2021.05.10.21256912,,#110476,Aldridge 2021,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 serological assay and viral testing: A report of professional football setting,"Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Ali; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Amir; Moghadam, Navid; Hassanmirzaei, Bahar; Haratian, Zohreh ","Purpose of the study: PCR is the current standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to its limitations, serological testing is considered an alternative method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this study, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of male professional football players and compared the results with the standard PCR test to investigate the association between the two tests. Study design: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients. Result(s): Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG. Conclusion(s): Our study revealed an inconsistency of results between the two tests; therefore, although application of serological assays alone seems insufficient in diagnosing COVID-19 disease, the findings are beneficial in the comprehension and the management of the disease.

Methods: All employees were invited to participate in a questionnaire and serological survey to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as part of a facility-wide quality improvement and infection prevention initiative regardless of clinical or nonclinical duties. The initiative was conducted from June 8 to July 8, 2020. Results: Of the 2,900 employees, 51% participated in the study, revealing a positive SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 4.9% (72 of 1,476; 95% CI, 3.8%-6.1%).

J.; Bleotu, L.; Ivaskevicius, R.; Papadatou, I.; Jogi, P.; Lischka, J.; Franckling-Smith, Z.; Isarova, D.; Grandjean, L.; Zavadska, D.","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may be driven, in part, by nosocomial exposure. If HCW exposure is predominantly nosocomial, HCWs in paediatric facilities, where few patients are admitted with COVID-19, may lack antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and be at increased risk during the current resurgence. Aim: To compare the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 amongst HCWs in paediatric facilities in seven European countries and South Africa (N1/48). Methods: All categories of paediatric HCWs were invited to participate in the study, irrespective of previous symptoms. A single blood sample was taken and data about previous symptoms were documented. Serum was shipped to a central laboratory in London where SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was measured. Findings: In total, 4114 HCWs were recruited between 1st May and mid-July 2020. The range of seroprevalence was 0-16.93%. The highest seroprevalence was found in London (16.93%), followed by Cape Town, South Africa (10.36%). There were no positive HCWs in the Austrian, Estonian and Latvian cohorts; 2/300 [0.66%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-2.4] HCWs tested positive in Lithuania; 1/124 (0.81%, 95% CI 0.14-4.3) HCWs tested positive in Romania; and 1/76 (1.3%, 95% CI 0.23-7.0) HCWs tested positive in Greece. Conclusion: Overall seroprevalence amongst paediatric HCWs is similar to their national populations and linked to the national COVID-19 burden. Staff working in paediatric facilities in low-burden countries have very low seroprevalence rates and thus are likely to be susceptible to COVID-19. Their susceptibility to infection may affect their ability to provide care in the face of increasing cases of COVID-19, and this highlights the need for appropriate preventative strategies in paediatric healthcare settings.

The aim of this study was to determine retrospective seroprevalence evolution among blood donors before pandemic, and along the first wave in Spain. A secondary objective was to determine whether age, blood group or haematological parameters are related to recent past infection. Material and Methods: A total of 12719 donations SARS-CoV-2 from July 2019 to October 2020 were analysed. Donors were 60.9% males and their average age was 46+/-13. An automated chemiluminiscence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for the in vitro semi quantitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma was performed. <h4>Results:</h4> Seropositive donation rate grew up from week 11 to week 21, reaching plateau by near 8% donations, sustained until week 43 when 2nd wave arose in our country. 6.7% individuals were positive by the end of 1st wave. No differences by sex age or blood group were found regarding antibodies. Lymphocyte were significantly higher in positive woman as compared to negative ones and haemoglobin were lower in positive men as compared to negative ones. <h4>Discussion:</h4> Seroprevalence due to asymptomatic cases would be equivalent to that of general population. Sex and age would not affect COVID-19 susceptibility but its severity. Gender differences are present even in asymptomatic individuals: females are possibly protected by their relative lymphocytosis and neutropenia whereas males are would be weaker as seropositive men show a decrease of haematocrit and haemoglobin. Further studies are needed to confirm these gender differences not only in severe but as well in asymptomatic cases as they can help better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis and prognosis.",2021,,,,,,PPR319031,10.1101/2021.04.28.21256242,,#106406,Martin 2021,"",""

Since the beginning of the pandemic in the country, cases have been increasing. The first case attended at the San Bartolome Hospital was on April 12. Since the first reports of COVID+ pregnant women in China, to date, there is more important information on epidemiology and perinatal results for the management of the COVID+ pregnant woman. Objective(s): To determine the epidemiology and maternal perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women at the Hospital Nacional Docente Madre Nino San Bartolome, Lima, Peru. Method(s): Observational cross-sectional study, from April to July 2020. All the pregnant women who arrived at the obstetric emergency at Hospital San Bartolome were included, and they underwent an immunochromatography test for IgM / IgG, to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19. Obstetric and perinatal variables were collected in a data sheet upon admission to the emergency room. Result(s): Rapid test for SARS-CoV-19 was performed in 345 pregnant women who were hospitalized for delivery care. The average age was 27 years, with 10% adolescents and 16% over 35 years; 60% had 2 to 4 pregnancies, 38% of deliveries were vaginal, 15% of them preterm; 1.2% of the pregnant women were symptomatic and 0.2% were admitted to the intensive care unit. 61% of the newborns weighed between 2 500 and 3 500 g, 53% were male, 94% had an Apgar score greater than 7 at one minute, 3.3% with a positive swab within the first 24 hours.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural Ethiopia: Randomized household serosurveys reveal level of spread during the first wave of the pandemic,"Abdella, Saro; Tollera, Getachew; Riou, Samuel; Seifu, Albab; Blachman, Anna; Moreno, Nicolas; Irarrazaval, Fernando; Browning, David; Tessema, Masresha; Assefa, Ashenafi; Abera, Adugna; Tasew, Geremew ","Background: The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly understood and to date has generally been characterised by a lower number of declared cases and deaths as compared to other regions of the world. Paucity of reliable information, with insights largely derived from limited RT-PCR testing in high-risk and urban populations, has been one of the biggest barriers to understanding the course of the pandemic and informed policy-making. Here we estimate seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Ethiopia during the first wave of the pandemic. Method(s): We undertook a population-based household seroprevalence serosurvey based on 1856 participants in Ethiopia, in the capital city Addis Ababa, and in Jimma, a middle-sized town in the Oromia region, and its rural surroundings (districts of Seka and Mana), between 22 July and 02 September 2020. We tested one random participant per household for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a high specificity rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and evaluated population seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance as well as age and sex of the participants. Finding(s): In total, 2304 random households were visited, with 1856 individuals consenting to participate. This produced a sample of 956 participants in Addis Ababa and 900 participants in Jimma. IgG prevalence was estimated at 1.9% (95% CI 0.4-3.7%), and combined IgM/IgG prevalence at 3.5% (95% CI 1.7-5.4%) for Addis Ababa in early August 2020, with higher prevalence in central sub-cities. Prevalence in Jimma town was lower at 0.5% (95% CI 0-1.8%) for IgG and 1.6% (95%CI 0-4.1%) for IgM/IgG, while in rural Jimma IgG prevalence was 0.2% and IgM/IgG 0.4% in early September. Interpretation(s): More than four months after the first cases were detected in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa displayed a prevalence under 5% and likely as low as 2%, while rural Jimma displayed a prevalence of 0.2%. A 2% seroprevalence figure for the capital translated to a number of cases at least five times larger than those reported for the country as a whole. At the same time, it contrasts with significantly higher seroprevalence figures in large cities in Europe and America only two to three months after the first cases. This population-based seroepidemiological study thus provides evidence of a slower spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Ethiopian population during the first wave of the pandemic and does not appear to support the notion that lower case numbers were simply a reflection of limited testing and surveillance.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were screened initially with two lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) and further confirmed with three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs). The assay performance was assessed using archived samples from 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 80 healthy individuals., Results: Between April 24 and May 8, 2020, 16,043 subjects (7,392 medical staff, 4,714 inpatients, 1,209 chaperones, 1,705 outpatients, and 1,023 fever clinic patients) were screened. No subject tested positive for viral RNA. Seventy-three (0.46%) tested positive for IgM or IgG on the initial LFI screening, of whom 63 were investigated with CLIAs: 2 (0.01%) were confirmed as seroreactive and 18 (0.11%) were indeterminate. Unconfirmed seroreactivity was significantly more frequent in fever clinic patients. The CLIAs showed similar (95.0-100%) IgM or IgG specificity but higher IgG sensitivity (93.75-96.88% vs. 31.25-81.25%) than the LFIs. The confirmed seropositive cases included a previously discharged COVID-19 patient and an undiagnosed symptomless patient showing detectable IgM and IgG over 35 days of follow-up.

Seroprevalence varied between 0.012% and 0.12% according to the testing algorithm and the confirmation criteria used, indicating that quality standards for serological tests are needed. Protective immunity in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who recovered needs to be investigated further, but the associated risk of transmission appeared limited.

Clinical course and seroprevalence of COVID-19 in children with rheumatic diseases. Cross-sectional study from a reference centre in Spain,"Udaondo, Clara; Millan-Longo, Claudia; Permuy, Celia; Valladares, Laura; Falces-Romero, Iker; Muñoz, Celia; Morales-Higuera, Monica; Alcobendas, Rosa; Remesal, Agustin; Murias, Sara; Calvo, Cristina","<h4>Background: </h4> Patients with rheumatic diseases have been considered at risk of COVID-19. A significant percentage of infections in children are asymptomatic or mild and can go unnoticed. This study aims to describe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of children with rheumatic diseases and assess possible risk factors. <h4>Methods: </h4> A cross-sectional study was performed in a pediatric rheumatology unit from a reference hospital in Madrid, from September 2020 to February 2021. Serology of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the same time as their routine laboratory tests, and a specific questionnaire was completed by parents. Demographics, treatment and disease activity from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were compared to the data of patients without laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Findings A total of 105 children were included. SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated in 27 patients (25.7%): 6 PCR and 21 positive IgG serology. The mean age was 11.8 years , and the majority of the patients were females (72.4%). Most of the children were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (70.3%; 19/27), followed by PFAPA (11.1%; 3/27). Immunosuppresive treatment was given in 88% of cases (24/27). Overall, 44.4% (12/27) of infected patients were asymptomatic. Three patients required hospital admission because of COVID-19, however none of them required oxygen supplementation. A total of 66.7% (18/27) of patients did not require any treatment or medical assistance. The seroprevalence in our cohort was 20% in contrast to the 7.7% population seroprevalence observed during the same study period in Spanish children. SARS-CoV-2 confirmed children with positive IgG or PCR were less frequently in remission (52% vs 72%; p 0.014). Moderate disease activity and treatment with oral corticosteroids were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 (OR 5.05; CI 95%: 1.56 - 16.3 and OR 4.2; CI 95%: 1.26 - 13.9 respectively). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> In a cohort of pediatric patients with rheumatic disease and immunosuppressive therapy, moderate disease activity and oral corticosteroids were associated with COVID-19 positive patients. Seroprevalence was significantly higher compared to the same age healthy population. The clinical manifestations were mild and there were no severe infections among the patients.",2021,,,,,,PPR339966,10.21203/rs.3.rs-505561/v1,,#110510,Udaondo 2021,"",""

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the COVID-19 pandemic among citizens 15 years or older in Denmark living in social housing (SH) areas. <h4>Methods</h4> As part of “Testing Denmark”, a nationwide sero-epidemiological surveillance survey, we conducted a study between January 8 th and January 31 st , 2021 with recruitment in 13 selected SH areas in Denmark. Participants were offered a point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody test and a questionnaire concerning previous testing (viral throat- and nasopharyngeal swab or antibody test), test results for COVID-19, demographics, household characteristics, employment, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and history of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Data on seroprevalence from Danish blood donors in same period using a total Ig ELISA assay were used as a proxy for the general Danish population. <h4>Findings</h4> Of the 13,279 included participants, 2,296 (17.3%) were seropositive (mean age 46.6 (SD 16.4) years, 54.2% female), which was 3 times higher than in the general Danish population (mean age 41.7 (SD 14.1) years, 48.5% female) in the same period (5.8%, risk ratios (RR) 2.96, 95% CI 2.78-3.16, p>0.001). Seropositivity was higher among males than females (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.22%, p=0.001) and increased with age, with an OR seropositivity of 1.03 for each 10-year increase in age (95% CI 1.00-1.06, p=0.031). Close contact with COVID-19-infected individuals was associated with a higher risk of infection, especially among members of the same households (OR 5.0, 95% CI 4.1-6.2 p<0,001). Adjusted for age, gender and region living at least 4 people in a household significantly increased the OR of seropositivity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p=0.02) as did living in a multi-generational household (OR 1.3 per generation, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.007).

Anosmia (RR 3.2 95% CI 2.8-3.7, p<0.001) and ageusia (RR 3.3, 95% CI 2.9-3.8, p<0.001) were strongest associated with seropositivity. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Danish citizens living in SH areas of low socioeconomic status had a three times higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence compared to the general Danish population. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in males and increased with age. Living in multiple generations or more than four persons in a household was an independent risk factor for being seropositive. Results of this study can be used for future consideration of the need for preventive measures in the populations living in SH areas.",2021,,,,,,PPR337191,10.1101/2021.05.07.21256725,,#110418,Fogh 2021,"",""

SARS-CoV-2 Infections Among Healthcare Workers Outside Hospitals,"Fröberg, Maria; Hassan, Sadaf Sakina; Pimenoff, Ville; Akterin, Susanne; Elfström, Miriam; Dillner, Joakim","Most Covid-related infections and deaths occur in healthcare outside hospitals. We wished to explore SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) in this setting. All healthcare providers in Stockholm, Sweden were asked to invite HCWs at work for a study of past or present SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs. This study reports the results from 839 HCWs, mostly employees of primary care centers, sampled in June 2020. Prior infection, as measured using seropositivity, was found among 12% (100/839) of HCWs, ranging from 0–29% between care units. There was a significant trend of decreasing serology positivity by age (one sided p-trend 0.0467). Seropositivity was highest among HCWs < 40 years of age. Within this age group there was 19% (23/120) seropositivity among women and 11% (15/38) among men (p < 0.02). Current infection, as measured using PCR, was found in only 1% and the typical pre-symptomatic testing pattern found in only 2 subjects. SARS-CoV-2 infections had been rather common among younger HCWs in this setting, but pre-symptomatic infection appeared to be uncommon. Sex differences in SARS-CoV2 specific seropositivity in HCWs younger than 40 years and older than 50 years can be due to exposure, behavior and/or immunological factors.",2021,,,,,,PPR335656,10.21203/rs.3.rs-493146/v1,,#106479,Fröberg 2021,"",""

Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and lymphocytopenia (20-40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low.

We used commercially available assays (Siemens) to test remainder plasma monthly in association with vaccination date and type, and assess prevalence of absent total receptor binding antibody, and absent or attenuated (index value < 10) semiquantitative receptor binding domain IgG index values. We used Poisson regression to evaluate risk factors for absent or attenuated response to vaccination. <h4>Results</h4> Among patients who were seronegative versus seropositive before vaccination, 62% and 56% were ≥65 years old, 20% and 24% were Hispanic, and 22% and 23% were Black. Median IgG index values rose steadily over time, and were higher among the seropositive than in the seronegative patients after completing vaccination (150 [25 th , 75 th percentile 23.2, 150.0] versus 41.6 [11.3, 150.0]).

However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study, we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biologic therapy. METHOD(S): From IBD patients under biologic therapy and recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany, 354 sera were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were: i] age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii] healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii] IBD patients under biologic therapy collected in the pre-COVID era. RESULT(S): Eight out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody [prevalence 2.3%]. The percentage of IgG-positive patients among those recruited from Milan was significantly higher than among those recruited from other locations [prevalence 5.4% vs 0.4%, p <0.005]. IgG-positive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever, anosmia, and ageusia, and were more likely to have entered into close contact with COVID-19-positive subjects before the study enrolment. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biologic therapy reflects values measured in the local general population. Specific symptoms and contact history with SARS-CoV2-infected individuals strongly increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 seropositivity.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center,"Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J.; Zilla, Megan L.; Wheeler, Sarah E. ","BACKGROUND: The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant (SOT), bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULT(S): We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 0.3%-2.4%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared with other groups. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3%-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

To understand protective immunity against COVID-19, we screened over 60,000 asymptomatic individuals in the Southeastern United States for IgG antibody positivity against the viral spike protein, and approximately three percent were positive. Of these three percent, individuals with the highest anti-S or anti-RBD IgG level showed a strong correlation with inhibition of ACE2 binding and cross-reactivity against non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus S-proteins. We also analyzed samples from 94 SARS-CoV-2 patients and compared them to asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients had decreased antibody responses, ACE2 binding inhibition, and antibody cross-reactivity. Our study shows that healthy individuals can mount robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms.

Up to 84.4% of residents had frailty, 84.9% co-morbidity and 69.3% cognitive impairment; 65.2% of workers were health-aides. COVID-19 seroprevalence was 55.4% (95% CI, 54.4-56.4) for older adults and 31.5% (30.6-32.4) for staff. In multivariable analysis frailty of residents was related with seropositivity (OR: 1.19, p = 0.02). In the case of staff, age > 50 years (2.10, p < 0.001), obesity (1.19, p = 0.01), being a health-aide (1.94, p < 0.001), working in a center with high seroprevalence in residents (3.49, p < 0.001), and contact with external cases of COVID-19 (1.52, p < 0.001) were factors associated with seropositivity. Past symptoms of COVID-19 were good predictors of seropositivity for residents (5.41, p < 0.001) and staff (2.52, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Level of dependency influences risk of COVID-19 among residents. Individual and work factors, and contacts outside the nursing home are associated with COVID-19 exposure in staff members. It is key to strengthen control measures to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into care facilities from the community. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among PEH and shelter workers in Denmark. <h4>Design and methods</h4> In November 2020, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional seroprevalence study among PEH and shelter workers at 21 recruitment sites in Denmark. The assessment included a point-of-care test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, followed by a questionnaire. The seroprevalence was compared to that of geographically matched blood donors considered as a proxy for the background population, tested using a total Ig ELISA assay. <h4>Results</h4> We included 827 participants in the study, of whom 819 provided their SARS-CoV-2 antibody results. Of those, 628 were PEH (median age 50.8 (IQR 40.9-59.1) years, 35.5% female) and 191 were shelter workers (median age 46.6 (IQR 36.1-55.0) years and 74.5% female). The overall seroprevalence was 6.7% and was similar among PEH and shelter workers (6.8% vs 6.3%, p=0.87); and 12.2% among all participants who engaged in sex work. The overall participant seroprevalence was significantly higher than that of the background population (2.9%, p <0.001). When combining all participants who reported sex work or were recruited at designated safe havens, we found a significantly increased risk of seropositivity compared to other participants (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.16-3.75, p=0.02). Seropositive and seronegative participants reported a similar presence of at least one SARS-CoV-2 associated symptom (49% and 54%, respectively). <h4>Interpretations</h4> The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was more than twice as high among PEH and associated shelter workers, compared to the background population. The subset of the study participants who were also sex workers were at particularly high risk of COVID-19 infection. <h4>Funding</h4> TrygFonden and HelseFonden.",2021,,,,,,PPR337312,10.1101/2021.05.07.21256388,,#110426,RöthlinEriksen 2021,"",""

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are still unclear. The Euro-COVIMID study aimed to determine the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as factors associated with COVID-19 occurrence and the impact of the pandemic in its management., Methods: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, or giant cell arteritis were recruited from six tertiary referral centres in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and recent disease flares, as well as information on COVID-19 symptoms, were collected through a questionnaire completed by participants. SARS-CoV-2 serology was systematically tested. The main outcome was the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, and incidence of recent disease flares, changes in treatments for underlying disease, and the reasons for treatment changes were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04397237., Findings: Between June 7 and Dec 8, 2020, 3136 patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory disease answered the questionnaire. 3028 patients (median age 58 years [IQR 46-67]; 2239 [73.9%] women and 789 [26.1%] men) with symptomatic COVID-19, serological data, or both were included in analyses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (5.5% [95% CI 4.7-6.4]) of 3018 patients who had serology tests. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 122 (4.0% [95% CI 3.4-4.8]) of 3028 patients, of whom 24 (19.7%) were admitted to hospital and four (3.3%) died. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33; p=0.0063), and higher numbers of recent disease flares (1.27, 1.02-1.58; p=0.030), whereas use of biological therapy was associated with reduced risk (0.51, 0.32-0.82; p=0.0057). At least one disease flare occurred in 654 (21.6%) of 3028 patients. Over the study period, 519 (20.6%) of 2514 patients had treatment changes, of which 125 (24.1%) were due to the pandemic., Interpretation: This study provides key insights into the epidemiology and risk factors of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overall, immunosuppressants do not seem to be deleterious in this scenario, and the control of inflammatory activity seems to be key when facing the pandemic., Funding: Pfizer, Sanofi, Amgen, Galapagos, and Lilly.

Regional seroprevalence estimates were weighted based on demographic differences with the general population. Seroprevalence was compared with reported COVID-19 case rates over time. <h4>Results/Findings</h4> For all regions, seroprevalence was <1.0% in March 2020. New York experienced the biggest increase (peak seroprevalence, 15.8 % in May). All other regions experienced modest increases in seroprevalence(1-2% in May-June to 2-4% in July-August). Seroprevalence was higher in younger, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic donors. Temporal increases in donor seroprevalence correlated with reported case rates in each region. In August, 1.3-5.6 estimated cumulative infections (based on seroprevalence data) per COVID-19 case reported to CDC. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Increases in seroprevalence were found in all regions, with the largest increase in New York. Seroprevalence was higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic blood donors than in non-Hispanic White blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of blood donor samples can be used to estimate the seroprevalence in the general population by region and demographic group. The methods derived from the RESPONSE seroprevalence study served as the basis for expanding SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveillance to all 50 states and Puerto Rico. <h4>Summary</h4> SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance data from blood donors in 6 US regions were used to estimate population weighted seroprevalence. Seroprevelance rates were higher in case rates.

The University of Salamanca (USAL) in Spain designed a project called “DIANCUSAL” (Diagnosis of New Coronavirus, COVID-19, in University of Salamanca) to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among its ~34,000 students and academic staff, as the influence of the university community in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the city of Salamanca and neighbouring towns hosting USAL campuses could be substantial. <h4>Objective: </h4> The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among USAL students, professors and staff and to evaluate the demographic, academic, clinical and lifestyle and behavioural factors related to seropositivity. Methodology : The DIANCUSAL study is an ongoing university population-based cross-sectional study, with the work described herein conducted from July-October 2020. All USAL students, professors, and staff were invited to complete an anonymized questionnaire. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected and quantified by using chemiluminescent assays for IgG and IgM. Principal findings: A total of 8197 (24.71%) participants were included. The mean age was 31.4 (14.5 SD) years, and 66.0% of the participants were female. The seroprevalence was 8.25% overall, and was highest for students from the education campus (12.5%) and professors from the biomedical campus (12.6%), with significant differences among faculties (p = 0.006). Based on the questionnaire, loss of smell and fever were the symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity, and 22.6% of seropositive participants were asymptomatic. Social distancing was the most effective hygiene measure (p= 0.0007). There were significant differences in seroprevalence between participants with and without household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (p=0.0000), but not between students who lived in private homes and those who lived in dormitories. IgG antibodies decreased over time in the participants with confirmed self-reported COVID-19 diagnoses. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The analysis revealed an overall 8.25% seroprevalence at the end of October 2020, with a higher seroprevalence in students than in staff. Thus, there is no need for tailored measures for the USAL community as the official average seroprevalence in the area was similar (7.8% at 22nd June and 12.4 at 15th November of 2020. Instead, USAL members should comply with public health measures.",2021,,,,,,PPR335544,10.21203/rs.3.rs-489321/v1,,#106477,Belen 2021,"",""

The dynamic situation with high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates prior to the winter semester (02.11.2020 until 01.03.2021) confronted university institutions with the difficult question of how or whether essential practical courses in medical schools can be conducted in presence. The gross course at Ulm University took place with a comprehensive hygiene concept and accompanied by a longitudinal study. This included in particular SARS-CoV-2 pathogen detection (swab with RT-PCR) at neuralgic time points, as well as antibody testing accompanied by a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the semester for both students and teaching staff. The first SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test prior to the gross anatomy course revealed two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive students of 327 individuals. All institute and student staff of this course tested negative at semester start (n=75). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 6.4 % of the anatomy course students (22 out of 345). The second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test after the Christmas break was negative in all participants, including teaching staff (n=429). At the end of the course in mid-February 2021, seroconversion after infection was detected in only two students of the anatomy course who participated in both tests (0.6 %, n=325). Also other semester cohorts of the first three years of study in human medicine and dentistry were invited. No further active SARS-CoV-2 infections at the start of the semester and seven seroconversions after infection (n=335) were detected after the semester in these cohorts.

SARS-CoV-2 serological assay and viral testing: a report of professional football setting.,"Hassanmirzaei, Bahar; Haratian, Zohreh; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Ali; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Amir; Moghadam, Navid","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: PCR is the current standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to its limitations, serological testing is considered an alternative method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this study, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of male professional football players and compared the results with the standard PCR test to investigate the association between the two tests., STUDY DESIGN: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients., RESULTS: Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG., CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an inconsistency of results between the two tests; therefore, although application of serological assays alone seems insufficient in diagnosing COVID-19 disease, the findings are beneficial in the comprehension and the management of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Germany - a population based sequential study in five regions,"Harries, Manuela; Gornyk, Daniela; Glöckner, Stephan; Strengert, Monika; Kerrinnes, Tobias; Bojara, Gerhard; Castell, Stefanie; Frank, Kerstin; Gubbe, Knut; Heise, Jana-Kristin; Hernandez, Pilar; Kappert, Oliver; Kern, Winfried; Illig, Thomas; Klopp, Norman; Maaß, Henrike; Ortmann, Julia; Kessel, Barbora; Roller, Gottfried; Schlüter, Monike; Tonn, Torsten; Ziemons, Michael; Kemmling, Yvonne; Lange, Berit; Krause, Gérard","Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an essential indicator to guide measures. Few population-based estimates are available in Germany. We determine seroprevalence allowing comparison between regions, time points, socio-demographic and health-related factors. MuSPAD is a sequential multi-local seroprevalence study. We randomly recruited adults in five counties with differing cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence July 2020 -February 2021. Serostatus was determined using Spike S1-specific IgG ELISA. We determined county-wise proportions of seropositivity. We assessed underestimation of infections, county and age specific infection fatality risks, and association of seropositivity with demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. We found seroprevalence of 2.4 % (95%CI: 1.8-3.1%) for Reutlingen in June 2020 (stage 1) which increased to 2.9% (95%CI: 2.1-3.8%) in October (stage 2), Freiburg stage 1 1.5% (95% CI: 1.1-2.1%) vs. 2.5% (95%CI: 1.8-3.4%), Aachen stage 1 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-3.1%) vs. 5.4% (95%CI: 4.4-6.6%), Osnabrück 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0-1.9%) and Magdeburg in Nov/Dec 2020. 2.4% (95%CI 1.9-3.1%). Number needed to quarantine to prevent one infection was 8.2. The surveillance detection ratio (SDR) between number of infections based on our results and number reported to health authorities ranged from 2.5-4.5. Participants aged 80+ had lower SDR. Infection fatality estimates ranged from 0.2-2.4%. Lower education was associated with higher, smoking with lower seropositivity. Seroprevalence remained low until December 2020 with high underdetection. The second wave from November 2020 to February 2021 resulted in additional 2-5% of the population being infected. Detected age specific differences of SDR should be taken into account in modelling and forecasting COVID-19 morbidity. <h4>Funding</h4> The Helmholtz Association, European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant number 101003480] and intramural funds of the Helmholtz Centre for infection (HZI). <h4>Highlights</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Seroepidemiological surveys on SARS-CoV-2 are a useful tool to track the transmission during the epidemic. We searched PubMed/the pre-print server medRxiv and included web-based reports from German health organizations using the keywords “seroprevalence”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Germany” and similar other English and German terms in the period from January 1st, 2020 until March 2021. We identified 30 published studies in Germany which mostly report low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (<5%). Most of these surveys were so-called hotspot studies which assessed seroprevalence after localized outbreaks or examined seroprevalence of specific population groups such as e.g. medical staff. Few studies are either population-based or blood donor-based, but do not allow comparisons between regions. To date, we only consider the Corona sub-study of the Rhineland study similar to MuSPAD. It reports a low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (46/4755; 0.97%; 95% CI: 0.72-1.30). Based on this, almost the entire German population remained susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the end of 2020. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide the first comprehensive, high-precision multi-region population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study with representative sampling following the WHO protocol in Germany. By measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we explore immunity at regional and national level over time. We also assess risk factors and sample each region twice, which permits to monitor seroprevalence progression throughout the epidemic in different exemplary German regions. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our results show low seroprevalence (<3%) until Mid-December 2020 in all regions. While estimates in Reutlingen, Aachen, Freiburg and Osnabrück reflect low seroprevalence mostly after the first wave, the survey in Magdeburg cumulatively already represents the beginning of the second wave. The number needed to quarantine to prevent one infection was 8.2 in our study. We also show that for the first wave reported infections reflected overall around 25% of those actually infected rising to 40-50% in the second wave. A slightly raised infection risk could be shown for persons with lower education.",2021,,,,,,PPR334882,10.1101/2021.05.04.21256597,,#106445,Harries 2021,"",""
Challenges and responses of elective orthopaedic surgery during the second wave of COVID-19.,"Nakai, Tsuyoshi; Iwasaki, Haruaki; Nishikawa, Tomoya; Higuchi, Ryo; Sakata, Kosuke; Matsuoka, Hozo; Iwata, Hirokazu; Sogo, Eiji; Nanno, Katsuhiko; Nakamura, Shigeko; Kuroda, Sanae; Hayashi, Junzo; Nakata, Seizoh","BACKGROUND: Elective orthopaedic surgery has been severely curtailed because of coronavirus disease, 2019. There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019., METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients., RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies. Among these 21 patients, 20 (95.2%) were asymptomatic., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most elective orthopaedic surgery patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are asymptomatic. In the second wave of coronavirus disease, 2019, universal testing of all patients should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent clusters of in-hospital transmission of the disease.

SARS-Cov2 Infection Detection by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Serologic Testing in Clinical Practice.,"Murad, Douglas; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Pallai, Ajaya; Garner, Omai B; Denny, Christopher T","Patients with SARS-Cov2 can be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the time of acute infection or later in their clinical course by detection of virus specific antibodies. While in theory complementary, both PCR and serologic tests have practical shortcomings. A retrospective study was performed in order to further define these limitations in a clinical context and to determine how to best utilize these tests in a coherent fashion. A total of 3,075 patients underwent both PCR and serology tests at UCLA in the study period. Among these, 2731 (89%) had no positive tests at all, 73 (2%) had a positive PCR test and only negative serology tests, 144 (5%) had a positive serology test and only negative PCR tests, and 127 (4%) had positive PCR and serology tests. Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e. PCR positive, serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-Cov2. On a quantitative level, the log number of days between symptom onset and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were positively correlated. However, there was no apparent relationship between PCR Ct and serologic AU/ml results.

Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination., METHODS: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgGNC) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgGNC to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgGNC, IgM-spike (IgMSP), and IgG-spike (IgGSP)) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort., RESULTS: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgGNC serology performed. Prospectively, IgGNC serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ (18.0%); IgGNC+ or IgGSP+ (23.5%); IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (23.8%); and IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (141/584 = 24.1%)., CONCLUSION: COST may be an effective tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.",2021,/,Vaccines,9,4,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040376,33924340,#103363,Narasimhan 2021,"",""

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, health care workers (HCWs) have been on the front line in caring for COVID-19 patients. Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the prevention of disease among this population. Methods. We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French university hospital after the first wave (May-June 2020), based on a validated lateral flow immuno-assay test (LFIAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics as well as data on the working characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and 23 care activities were systematically recorded. The effectiveness of protective equipment was also estimated, based on self-declaration of mask use. SARS-CoV-2 IgG status was modelled by multiple imputations approach, accounting for the performance of the test and data on serum validation ELISA immunoassay. Findings. Among the 3,234 enrolled HCWs, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Contact with relatives or HCWs who developed COVID-19 were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during naso-pharyngeal sampling, patient mobilisation, clinical and eye examination was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without self-declared appropriate use of protective equipment. Interpretation. Main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs were i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures.",2021,,,,,,PPR316600,10.1101/2021.04.22.21255922,,#104532,Paris 2021,"",""

Such information is essential for health planners, as many of those infected show no or only mild symptoms and thus, escape the surveillance system. We therefore aimed to describe the course of the pandemic in the Munich general population living in private households from April 2020 to January 2021. <h4>Methods:</h4> The KoCo19 baseline study took place from April to June 2020 including 5313 participants (age 14 years and above). From November 2020 to January 2021, we could again measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in 4,433 of the baseline participants (response 83%). Participants were offered a self-sampling kit to take a capillary blood sample (dry blood spot; DBS). Blood was analysed using the Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche). Questionnaire information on socio-demographics and potential risk factors assessed at baseline was available for all participants. In addition, follow-up information on health-risk taking behaviour and number of personal contacts outside the household (N=2768) as well as leisure time activities (N=1263) were collected in summer 2020. <h4>Results:</h4> Weighted and adjusted (for specificity and sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.3%) as compared to 1.8% (95% CI 1.3-3.4%) at baseline. 91% of those tested positive at baseline were also antibody-positive at follow-up. While sero-prevalence increased from early November 2021 to January 2021, no indication of geospatial clustering across the city of Munich was found, although cases clustered within households. Taking baseline result and time to follow-up into account, men and participants in the age group 20-34 years were at the highest risk of sero-positivity. In the sensitivity analyses, differences in health-risk taking behaviour, number of personal contacts and leisure time activities partly explained these differences. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The number of citizens in Munich with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was still below 5% during the 2nd wave of the pandemic. Antibodies remained present in the majority of baseline participants. Besides age and sex, potentially confounded by differences in behaviour, no major risk factors could be identified.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence rates among HCPs., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-facing oncology HCPs working at three large UK hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing [Luminex and point-of-care (POC) tests] on two occasions 28 days apart (June-July 2020)., RESULTS: In total, 434 HCPs were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%), administrators (10.1%); 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2. All participants were PCR negative during the study, but 18.4% were Luminex seropositive on day 1, of whom 42.5% were POC seropositive. Nurses had the highest seropositive prevalence trend (21.3%, P = 0.2). Thirty-eight per cent of seropositive HCPs reported previous SARS-CoV-2 symptoms: 1.9 times higher odds than seronegative HCPs (P = 0.01).

In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history., RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66)., CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.",2021,/,Journal of hospital medicine,16,5,274-281,,https://dx.doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3609,33929947,#105229,Khan 2021,"",""

Rapidly increasing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and limited clinical disease in three Malian communities: a prospective cohort study,"Sagara, Issaka; Woodford, John; Kone, Mamady; Assadou, Mahamadoun Hamady; Katile, Abdoulaye; Attaher, Oumar; Zeguime, Amatigue; Doucoure, M'Bouye; Higbee, Emily; Lane, Jacquelyn; Doritchamou, Justin; Zaidi, Irfan; Esposito, Dominic; Kwan, Jennifer; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Dicko, Alassane; Duffy, Patrick","<h4>Background: </h4> The extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission in Mali and the surrounding region is not well understood, although infection has been confirmed in nearly 14,000 symptomatic individuals and their contacts since the first case in March 2020. We aimed to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in three Malian communities, and understand factors associated with infection. Methods Between 27 July 2020 and 29 January 2021, we collected blood samples along with demographic, social, medical and self-reported symptoms information from residents aged 6 months and older in three study communities at two study visits. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured using a highly specific two-antigen ELISA optimized for use in Mali. We calculated cumulative adjusted seroprevalence for each site and evaluated factors associated with serostatus at each visit by univariate and multivariate analysis. Findings Overall, 94.8% (2533/2672) of participants completed both study visits. A total of 50.3% (1343/2672) of participants were male, and 31.3% (837/2672) were aged <10 years, 27.6% (737/2672) were aged 10-17 years, and 41.1% (1098/2572) were aged >/=18 years. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 exposure rate was 58.5% (95% CI: 47.5 to 69.4). This varied between sites and was 73.4% (95% CI: 59.2 to 87.5) in the urban community of Sotuba, 53.2% (95% CI: 42.8 to 63.6) in the rural town of Bancoumana, and 37.1% (95% CI: 29.6 to 44.5) in the rural village of Doneguebougou. This equates to an infection rate of approximately 1% of the population every three days in the study communities between visits. Increased age and study site were associated with serostatus at both study visits. There was minimal difference in reported symptoms based on serostatus. Interpretation The true extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Mali is greater than previously reported and now approaches hypothetical herd immunity in urban areas. The epidemiology of the pandemic in the region may be primarily subclinical and within background illness rates. In this setting, ongoing surveillance and augmentation of diagnostics to characterize locally circulating variants will be critical to implement effective mitigation strategies like vaccines.

Incidence of COVID-19 recurrence among large cohort of healthcare employees.,"Veronica, Fitzpatrick; Anne, Rivelli; Christopher, Blair; Kenneth, Copeland; Jon, Richards","PURPOSE: To quantify COVID-19 recurrence among clinical and non-clinical healthcare employees with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies or prior COVID-19 infection., METHODS: This prospective, cohort study collected and resulted SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples as positive or negative from June 8 to July 10, 2020 from a convenience sample of 16,233 adult participants employed by a large Midwestern healthcare system. Documented positive PCR test results representing COVID-19 infections were recorded up to four months prior to and post-IgG testing., RESULTS: 913 (6.12%) participants, including 45 (4.93%) IgG positive participants, experienced COVID-19 infections after study initiation, representing a 51% increased risk of COVID-19 infection among IgG positive participants (IRR=1.51). Regressions adjusted for documented disparities showed no difference in COVID-19 infection by IgG status (OR=1.19; p=0.3117) but significantly greater odds in COVID-19 recurrence among participants with a prior documented COVID-19 infection (OR=1.93; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and prior COVID-19 infection do not appear to offer meaningful protection against COVID-19 recurrence in healthcare workers.

Most antibody assays cannot distinguish natural infection from vaccination. <h4>Objective</h4> To assess the accuracy of a nucleocapsid-containing assay in identifying natural infection among vaccinated individuals. <h4>Design</h4> A longitudinal cohort comprised of healthcare workers (HCW) in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area was enrolled. Two rounds of seroprevalence studies separated by one month were conducted from 11/2020–1/2021. Capillary blood from round 1 and 2 was tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with a qualitative chemiluminescent ELISA (spike-only assay). In a subsample of participants (n=82) at round 2, a second assay was performed that measured IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nucleocapsid-containing assay). Round 1 biospecimen collections occurred prior to vaccination in all participants. Vaccination status at round 2 was determined via self-report. <h4>Setting</h4> The Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. <h4>Participants</h4> HCW age 18-80 years. <h4>Exposures</h4> Round 1 recent SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via a spike-only assay and participant self-report. <h4>Outcomes</h4> Round 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via the nucleocapsid-containing assay. Area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the discriminatory ability of round 2 IgG reactivity to nucleocapsid for identification of recent infection determined during round 1 <h4>Results</h4> Participants had a mean age of 40 (range=23-66) years, 83% were female, 46% reported vaccination prior to the round 2 testing. Round 1 seroprevalence was 9.5%. Among those not recently infected, when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, elevated levels of spike 1 (p<0.001) and spike 2 (p=0.01) were observed while nucleocapsid levels were not statistically significantly different (p=0.90). Among all participants, nucleocapsid response predicted recent infection with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.93(0.88,0.99). Among individuals vaccinated >10 days prior to antibody testing, the specificity of the nucleocapsid-containing assay was 92% and while the specificity of the spike-only assay was 0%. <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> An IgG assay identifying reactivity to nucleocapsid protein is an accurate predictor of natural infection among vaccinated individuals while a spike-only assay performed poorly. In the era of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seroprevalence studies monitoring natural infection will require assays that do not rely on spike-protein response alone.",2021,,,,,,PPR313425,10.1101/2021.04.12.21255330,,#102921,Demmer 2021,"",""

","Background: A seroprevalence study can estimate the percentage of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in the general population; however, most existing reports have used a convenience sample, which may bias their estimates. Method(s): We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, ages >=18 years and residing in noncongregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020, and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among this population. Result(s): Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [+/- 17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic white individuals) included at the state level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state level reported following risk-mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. Conclusion(s): These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and there is variation by race and ethnicity.

We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHOD(S): From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULT(S): Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSION(S): Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given disparities in infection risk, effective interventions for at-risk groups are needed during ongoing transmission.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Due to the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin).

Application of a SARS-CoV-2-specific serologic assay for translational research and surveillance,"Sherman, Amy C.; Espinoza, Daniel; Zhu, Yerun; Wu, Henry M.; Rouphael, Nadine; Fridkin, Scott; Smith, Teresa C.; Taibl, Kaitlin R.; Howard-Anderson, Jessica; Fairley, Jessica K.; Edupuganti, Sri; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Ospina, Jaime Cardona; Arias, Juan Carlos Sepulveda; Collins, Matthew H. ","Background: Sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody diagnostics are urgently needed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the general population and special risk groups. Moreover, validated serologic assays are critical to understanding immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time and identifying correlates of protection. Method(s): An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol to detect antibodies (IgG) that bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was validated and ROC curve analysis performed by testing a large panel of pre-pandemic sera (n=162) and convalescent sera from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=60). We then applied this test in two cohorts: 1) Healthcare personnel (HCP) that were enrolled in a longitudinal surveillance cohort just after peak local transmission and 2) Mildly ill patients being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR from NP swabs in an ambulatory testing clinic. Result(s): ROC curve analysis yielded an AUC of 0.9953, with a sensitivity and specificity at 91.67% and 99.38% at the optimal OD normalization threshold of 0.20. In 240 HCP surveilled at enrollment, 5.83% had positive IgG results. Of 19 symptomatic patients who presented to the ambulatory clinic, 5/19 had a positive PCR. In convalescence (13-74 days post symptom onset), 3 of those 5 were positive for IgG. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA. This simple assay is an efficient way to track seroconversion and duration of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 for different populations, particularly since RBD-binding antibodies have been shown to correlate with neutralization activity and may be useful to determine protective immunity following natural infection or vaccination.

"SARS-Cov-2 RNA and antibodies among people experiencing homelessness and staying in shelters or outdoor encampments in Denver, Colorado, May-July 2020","McCormick, David; Wilcox, Kay; Marx, Grace E.; Scott, Tracy; Chavez, Jesse; Wendel, Karen; Burman, William; Stella, Sarah A. ","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected people experiencing homelessness (PEH) residing in shelters. Initial and regular testing of PEH in communities with moderate or substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may limit spread in shelters. We analyzed factors associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody tests for PEH staying in shelters or encampments in Denver, Colorado. Methods. In May 2020, Denver Public Health collaborated with local leaders to identify 4 homeless shelters and 3 outdoor encampments for voluntary, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing. At each testing event, a short questionnaire including sociodemographic factors and symptoms was administered to PEH who consented to testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs; antibody testing was performed on venous blood samples. PEH reporting a prior positive RT-PCR test were not retested but were eligible for antibody testing. Statistical calculations were performed with an alpha of 0.05; all tests were two-sided. Results. From June 2-July 28, 2020, 931 PEH were approached. A total of 863 RT-PCR tests were performed at 14 testing events, and 334 antibody tests were performed at 5 testing events. Overall, 604 and 259 RT-PCR tests were conducted in 4 shelters and 3 encampments, respectively; 189 and 145 antibody tests were conducted in 3 shelters and 2 encampments, respectively. PEH tested in shelters were older, more often men, less often Native American, and less likely to report COVID-19 symptoms than those tested at encampments (Table 1). Overall, 9% of PEH tested in shelters tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 3% of PEH tested in encampments (p=0.002); 8% of men had positive RT-PCR results compared to 2% of women (p=0.03) (Table 2). PEH tested at shelters had a higher percentage of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those tested in encampments (24% vs 8%, p=0.0002; Table 3). Neither RT-PCR nor antibody test results differed significantly by race or ethnicity. Conclusion. A greater percentage of PEH tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies at shelters than encampments, suggesting that continued assessment of mitigation strategies in shelters should be a priority.

We report epidemiologic data from a study investigating a cohort of women who became pregnant just before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11-13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples. COVID-19 cumulative incidence during the first trimester was of 10.1% with high prevalence of asymptomatic patients (42.8%). Similar to the course of the disease in non pregnant adults, 80% to 90% of infections were not severe.The prevalence of reported symptoms was four-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (57%) than in those negative (13%) (P <.001), suggesting that direct self-testing should open doors to confirmatory testing for COVID-19.

"Point-of-care, in-home SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing to assess seroprevalence in at-risk health care workers","Meissner, Eric G.; Litwin, Christine; Crocker, Tricia; Mack, Elizabeth; Card, Lauren ","Background: Health care workers are at significant risk for infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): We utilized a point-of-care, lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (RayBiotech) to conduct a seroprevalence study in a cohort of at-risk health care workers (n=339) and normal-risk controls (n=100) employed at an academic medical center. To minimize exposure risk while conducting the study, consents were performed electronically, tests were mailed and then self-administered at home using finger stick blood, and subjects uploaded a picture of the test result while answering an electronic questionnaire. We also validated the assay using de-identified serum samples from patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result(s): Between April 14th and May 6th 2020, 439 subjects were enrolled. Subjects were 68% female, 93% white, and most were physicians (38%) and nurses (27%). In addition, 37% had at least 1 respiratory symptom in the prior month, 34% had cared for a patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, 57% and 23% were worried about exposure at work or in the community, respectively, and 5 reported prior documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. On initial testing, 3 subjects had a positive IgG test, 336 had a negative test, and 87 had an inconclusive result. Of those with an inconclusive result who conducted a repeat test (85%), 96% had a negative result. All 3 positive IgG tests were in subjects reporting prior documented infection. Laboratory validation showed that of those with PCR-proven infection more than 13 days prior, 23/30 were IgG positive (76% sensitivity), whereas 1/26 with a negative prior PCR test were seropositive (95% specificity). Repeat longitudinal serologic testing every 30 days for up to 4 times is currently in progress. Conclusion(s): We conducted a contact-free study in the setting of a pandemic to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in an at-risk group of health care workers.

Lack of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion after prompt identification and cohorting of sentinel SARS-CoV-2-positive residents in a skilled nursing facility,"Bhattacharya, Debika; Fulcher, Jennifer A.; Schwartzman, William A.; Beenhouwer, David O.; Winnett, Alexander; Sohn, Linda; Calub, Feliza; Lee-Chang, Ian; Vallone, John; Graber, Christopher J.; Goetz, Matthew B. ","Background: Despite numerous outbreaks, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) are not well described. We reviewed serological test results in a cohort of SNF residents who had been repetitively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Method(s): In late March 2019, we identified symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents at a SNF. In response, all remaining SNF patients were serially screened, and all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were transferred to the acute care hospital or cohorted in a separate COVID Recovery Unit (CRU) in the SNF. In early June, all SNF residents (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative) underwent serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1/S2) IgG (DiaSorin). DiaSorin IgG-positive results for patients that were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative were reflexed to nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott). Antibody testing occurred a median of 69 days (63-70 IQR) after PCR positivity. Result(s): Nineteen SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents were identified from the outbreak and an additional 9 were transferred from the acute care hospital to the CRU; 1 died and 1 received convalescent plasma leaving 26 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents, including 6 who were asymptomatic, that were eligible for serologic testing. Twenty-four of the 26 were positive for IgG by the DiaSorin assay; one seronegative resident was one of the asymptomatic residents. There were an additional 121 residents in the SNF whose SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative at least once. Among these 121 SNF residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all but two were seronegative by the Diasorin assay. The two seropositive residents had no nucleocapsid antibodies when reflex tested by the Abbott assay. Conclusion(s): In a limited sample of SNF residents with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, the sensitivity of the Diasorin assay was 92% (24/26) and the specificity was 98% (119/121). None of the residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR had confirmed positive antibody results using reflex testing (DiaSorin/Abbott).

Responding to the pandemic, multi-agency collaborative partnerships put in place actions integrating point-of-care antibody testing at established large-scale COVID-19 testing sites where the baseline seropositivity of COVID-19 in health care workers and first responders in Florida at the start of the pandemic was established., Purpose: Determine the seropositivity of healthcare workers and first responders at five drive thru testing sites using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in Florida from May 6 through June 3, 2020., Methods: The first drive-thru SARS-CoV-2 antibody test site was opened at Miami Hard Rock Stadium, May 6, 2020. Testing expanded to three additional sites on May 9, 2020: Jacksonville, Orlando, and Palm Beach. The fifth and final site, Miami Beach, began testing on May 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and first responder's self-seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing were designated for antibody testing and completed a laboratory collection form onsite for the point-of-care test. All testing was performed on whole blood specimens (obtained by venipuncture) using the Cellex Inc. qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. Seropositivity was assessed by univariate analysis and by logistic regression including the covariates age, sex, race/ethnicity, and testing location., Results and Discussion: As of June 3, 2020, of 5,779 healthcare workers and first responders tested, 4.1% were seropositive (range 2.6-8.2%).

Health Care Acquired COVID-19 is Less Symptomatic than Community Acquired Disease Among Healthcare Workers.,"Fletcher, Jeffrey J; Feucht, Eric C; Hahn, Peter Y; McGoff, Theresa N; Dehart, Del J; El Mortada, Mohamad E; Grifka, Ronald G","OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized healthcare workers (HCW) with high-risk exposures outside the healthcare system would have less asymptomatic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and more symptoms than those without such exposures., DESIGN: A longitudinal point prevalence study during August 17- September 4 2020 and December 2nd - 23rd., SETTING: Community based teaching health system., PARTICIPANTS: All HCS were invited to participate. Among HCW who acquired COVID-19, logistic regression models were used to evaluate the adjusted odds of asymptomatic disease using high-risk exposure outside the healthcare system as the explanatory variable. The number of symptoms between exposure groups was evaluated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The risk of seropositivity among all HCS by work exposure was evaluated during both periods., INTERVENTIONS: Survey and serological testing., RESULT: Seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.2% - 2.6%) to 13.7% (95% CI 11.9% - 15.5%) during the study. Only during Period 2 did HCW with the highest work exposure (versus low exposure) have an increased risk of seropositivity (RD 7% [95% CI 1% -13%]). Participants who had a high-risk exposure outside of work (compared to those without) had a decreased probability of asymptomatic disease (OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.16 - 0.86]) and demonstrated more symptoms (median of 3 [IQR 5] vs 1 [IQR 2]; P = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Health care acquired COVID-19 increases the probability of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease compared to community acquired disease.

Acquired GH deficiency (GHD) has been recently proposed as a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 infections. However, acquired GHD is often associated to other factors, including pituitary tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, and additional pituitary hormones deficits and their replacements, which, together, may hinder an accurate analysis of the relationship between GHD and COVID-19. Therefore, we decided to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the frequency of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in adults subjects with untreated isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous null mutation in the GHRH receptor gene., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 27 adult IGHD subjects and 27 age- and gender-matched local controls. Interview, physical examination, bio-impedance, hematological and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed., RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies between the two groups.

The aim of this study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 infections in nephrologists in the first and second pandemic waves, describing risk factors and clinical features., Methods: This national survey was sent to Spanish nephrologists. Epidemiological data, comorbidities and medications were collected and compared between infected and non-infected nephrologists. Symptoms, prescribed treatments and outcomes are described for infected nephrologists., Results: Three hundred and twenty-seven nephrologists (66% female, age 46 +/- 11 years) completed the survey. Of them, 62 (19%) were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Infection was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the 37 symptomatic patients (62%) and by serological tests in 25 (38%) asymptomatic individuals. Five (8%) of the infected nephrologists were hospitalized. Contrary to the general population, most infections occurred during the first pandemic wave and, specifically, during the first month, when personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages were more severe. Factors associated with infection in univariate analysis were younger age (P = 0.004), work in non-nephrology departments (P = 0.045), higher exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 patients (P < 0.001), lack of appropriate PPE (P < 0.001) and non-O ABO blood group.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia,"Mahallawi, W. H.; Al-Zalabani, A. H.","Background: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%& ndash;21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Asymptomatic healthcare worker COVID-19 testing program,"Horton, Lucy E.; Taplitz, Randy; Torriani, Francesca J.; Abeles, Shira R.; Ikeda, Lydia; Ikeda, Tyson ","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains a major threat worldwide. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high infection rates reported from HCWs in hard-hit regions2,3, raising concerns about nosocomial infections and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in protecting HCWs. Asymptomatic infection is estimated 17.9% to 33.3%4 and is a common source of transmission5. We designed a HCW testing program to address patient and employee concerns about exposures in the healthcare setting at our 808-bed health system. During the time of employee testing, the mean (range) number of inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID was 30 (22-38) of a mean (range) daily census of 560 (492-602) (approximately 5.4%). Method(s): This opt-in program offered SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic HCWs with paired nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab for PCR (Roche) and serum IgG antibody testing (Diazyme). While initially designed as a pilot project in the Emergency Departments and COVID-19 units, it was quickly expanded to a health system-wide initiative. Result(s): From April 22 to June 2, PCR testing was performed on 5826 asymptomatic HCWs with four PCR tests resulting positive (0.09%). Of 5589 serologic tests (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) performed, 57 tested positive (1.02 %). All HCW with a positive IgG had a concurrent negative PCR. Conclusion(s): In this cross-sectional evaluation, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in asymptomatic HCWs at UC San Diego was less than 1%, supporting modeling estimations at the San Diego County level of very low levels of community exposure at the time of this testing. Further analyses of incidence rates and potential risk factors such as employee roles within the healthcare system, community and healthcare exposures, and home zip code are underway.

We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection., METHODS: A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts., FINDINGS: From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7.6 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57.3 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0.159 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days., INTERPRETATION: A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care of the UK Government, Public Health England, The National Institute for Health Research, with contributions from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments.

Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in the US as of September 2020,"Bajema, Kristina L.; Wiegand, Ryan E.; Cuffe, Kendra; Patel, Sadhna V.; Lim, Travis; Havers, Fiona P.; Fry, Alicia M.; Hall, Aron J.; Gundlapalli, Adi V.; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Petersen, Lyle R.; Edens, Chris; Iachan, Ronaldo; Lee, Adam; Moyse, Davia; Harding, Lee; Martin, Kelly; Biel, Marjorie; Deng, Yangyang; Kyle, Tonja; Meyer, William A.; Mathur, Mohit ","Importance: Case-based surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection likely underestimates the true prevalence of infections. Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions. Objective(s): To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020. Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >=65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status. Result(s): Of 177919 serum samples tested, 103771 (58.3%) were from women, 26716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction. Biweekly nationwide testing of commercial clinical laboratory sera can play an important role in helping track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in health care workers at an academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts","Cole, Manisha; Kataria, Yachana; Duffy, Elizabeth; Perkins, Elissa; Pierre, Cassandra; Elizabeth Ragan, Christopher Andry; De La Cena, Kyle; Bouton, Tara; Werler, Martha; Jacobson, Karen ","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has infected over 124,813 and caused the deaths of at least 600 healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United States as of October 11th, 2020. Boston's surge was early April to mid- May, with as many as 237 COVID-19 positive patients admitted per day, a 50% rate. Seroprevalence studies are important since the proportion of individuals that are asymptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and this assessment could lead to understanding disease transmission rates. HCWs are in a high-risk setting. It is important to understand disease burden among this population as it can help identify areas of high risk and inform infection control policy to slow infection rates. We aim to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs at our Boston area hospital. Design(s): Eligible HCWs were over 18 years old and worked on campus during the surge. With IRB approval, subjects provided consent, and completed a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic, occupation, COVID exposure, and infection prevention measures by using REDCap database. Participants had their blood drawn between July 13th - 26th for qualitative COVID-19 IgG antibody testing. Analyses were performed by the clinical pathology laboratory , detecting IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein on EUA approved assay. Result(s): The HCWs overall seroprevalence rate was 5.45%. Participants that were seropositive were more likely to be younger, female, and non-smokers. Obese participants had significantly higher odds of being seropositive (OR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.25 - 3.32). Nurses (OR: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.64-3.08)) and patient facing allied health ((OR: 1.61 (95% CI: 0.74-4.22)) were more likely to be seropositive. 75.3% of participants with a positive RT-PCR test were seropositive, while 2% with a negative RT-PCR test were seropositive. 1.8% with no prior RT-PCR testing were seropositive. Seropositivity status was significantly associated with fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, myalgia, loss of appetite, smell and taste, and lack of physical distancing with co-workers. Conclusion(s): These results support efficacy of hand hygiene and PPE, highlighting the need to reinforce these practices when engaging with colleagues. Nurses and allied HCWs were more likely to be seropositive, likely due to frequency of exposure to positive patients or relaxed distancing among coworkers. This data suggests a higher prevalence of milder symptoms that do not always prompt caution or changes in daily activities.

"Frequency of symptoms and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Orleans, Louisiana","Feehan, Amy K.; Fort, Daniel; Price-Haywood, Eboni; Velasco, Cruz; Garcia Diaz, Julia; Sapp, Eric; Pevey, Dawn; Seoane, Leonardo ","Background: Individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who do not report symptoms throughout the course of infection (asymptomatic) or those who are asymptomatic when they first contract the virus (presymptomatic) are a major public health concern. However, few prevalence studies to date have targeted the question of asymptomatic frequency within a community. Method(s): A stratified, random sample of subjects were sent to testing sites to complete a verbal consent, survey, nasopharyngeal swab, and blood draw. Swabs were tested for active viral shedding (PCR) and blood was tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2. Disease progression and IgG antibody response Results: Of the 2,640 subjects, 24 (0.9%) were PCR-positive alone, 30 (1.1%) were PCR-positive and IgG-positive, and 129 (4.9%) were IgG-positive alone. Subjects who reported anosmia were 17 times more likely to test positive. Thirtyeight percent of subjects never experienced symptoms despite developing antibodies to the virus, and 75% did not experience symptoms in the early stage of infection. Rates of reported asymptomatic infection and comorbidities statistically significantly increased with age. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized study that pairs PCR and IgG serology that addresses asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing a high frequency of asymptomatic disease. More research is needed to clarify differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic disease.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based sample across all age categories., METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1,316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1,211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and due to uncertain estimates retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S., RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n=3,000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for ELISA's manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95%HDI 1.81-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95%CI, 0.00-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95%HDI, 0.40-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on November 11, 2020, was 4.06% (95%HDI, 2.97-5.16%) and on October 3, 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95%HDI, 3.18-5.47%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late-April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducting in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.

Sars-cov-2 seroprevalence among health care workers-a voluntary screening study in a regional medical center in southern germany,"Muller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Ruhnke, Michaela; Spranger, Mareike; Kaier, Klaus; Borde, Johannes P. ","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a potentially severe clinical manifestation, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and currently poses a worldwide challenge. Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of any health care system and thus especially at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their potentially frequent and close contact with patients suffering from COVID-19. Serum samples from 198 HCWs with direct patient contact of a regional medical center and several outpatient facilities were collected during the early phase of the pandemic (April 2020) and tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Commercially available IgA-and IgG-specific ELISAs were used as screening technique, followed by an in-house neutralization assay for confirmation. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in seven of 198 (3.5%) tested HCWs. There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between the regional medical center (3.4%) and the outpatient institution (5%). The overall seroprevalence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in HCWs in both a large regional medical center and a small outpatient institution was low (3.5%) at the beginning of April 2020. The findings may indicate that the timely implemented preventive measures (strict hygiene protocols, personal protective equipment) were effective to protect from transmission of an airborne virus when only limited information on the pathogen was available.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

A.","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, dubbed COVID-19, has become one of the most serious challenges for human populations in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Rapid spreading and increased mortality related to it required new approaches to manage epidemic processes on a global scale. One of such approaches was based on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence associated with COVID-19. Our aim was to summarize the results on assessing seroprevalence to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (Nc) in residents from 26 regions of the Russian Federation, carried out during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and methods. Seroprevalence distribution was examined in 26 model regions of the Russian Federation according to the unified method developed by the Rospotrebnadzor with the participation of the Federal State Institution Saint Petersburg Pasteur Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Such approach implied formation of a group of volunteer subjects in model geographic region who were tested by ELISA for anti-Nc serum antibody level in peripheral blood. Analyzed primary data obtained in separate regions were either accepted for publication or released. Results. The current paper finalizes the data obtained in all 26 regions of the Russian Federation. The total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 19.5 (10.0-25.6)% with the maximum and minimum value found in the Kaliningrad Region and the Republic of Crimea, respectively (50.2% vs. 4.3%). A pattern of age-related seroprevalence distribution indicates insignificant predominance of seroprevalence among subjects of 1-17 years old: 22.1 (13.1-31.8)%. Among COVID-19 convalescents positive for SARS-CoV Nc antibodies it reached 60.0 (40.0-73.3)%. The number of contact persons comprised 6285 subjects or 8.5% of total volunteer cohort, with the level of seroprevalence reaching up to 25.3 (17.95-35.8)%. A direct correlation was revealed between levels of seroprevalence in convalescent and contact volunteers. In addition, the reproductive number for SARS-CoV was calculated comprising 5.8 (4.3-8.5) suggesting that one convalescent subject can infect at least 4 healthy individuals. A high level of asymptomatic forms of COVID-19 among seropositive subjects was confirmed empirically comprising up to 93.6 (87.1-94.9)%. Conclusion. A single cross-sectional study performed during 2020 June-August timeframe allowed to assess pattern of sex- and age-related COVID-19 seroprevalence for general population in 26 Russian Federation regions.

Using serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to conserve PCR tests in a resource constrained combat environment,"White, Brian K.; Nichols, Shawnn; Stuart, Rory P.; Rutherford, Ashley E.; Comes, Ryan; Cybulski, Daniel; Case, Alex M.; Sachdeva, Mohit; Bova, Jacob ","Background: In March 2020, COVID-19 threatened combat operations in Afghanistan. At that time, the NATO Resolute Support mission involved nearly 17,000 troops from 38 partner nations, plus civilians who support the mission, scattered throughout Afghanistan. While Afghanistan did not initially report many confirmed cases, large numbers of cases were reported from neighboring countries with known migration across the borders (sometimes thousands/day). Military medical leaders advised commanders regarding the potential health risks to the force, balancing with risks to the mission. Quarantine and isolation protocols were established. Public health interventions of social distancing, cloth mask wear, enhanced environmental cleaning, active case finding, and emphasis on hand hygiene and cough etiquette were enforced. However, many base locations were unable to alleviate close living quarters. Testing was identified as a means to assess risk to the population. Testing capabilities were limited, particularly PCR. When this testing strategy was established, the utilization and interpretation of antibody tests was quite controversial. With rapid antibody kits, the time to detection of both IgM and IgG are similar; detection of either cannot identify the time since exposure. Method(s): A novel surveillance plan was established whereby subpopulations at highest risk for exposure to the virus were screened with antibody tests from 17 Apr-1 Jun, 2020. High risk populations included: those leaving quarantine, base defense guards, isolation unit guards, medical personnel, dining facility workers, and those who interact with local populations. Individuals with detectable antibody (either IgM or IgG) were further evaluated with PCR tests. Result(s): In the first six weeks of this testing strategy, 1957 antibody tests were utilized. A total of 37 specimens were identified antibody positives with seroprevalence of 2% (Figure 1). Thirteen were identified to have positive IgG, 22 with IgM, and 2 with both. PCR was performed on those with detectable antibody, 13 (35%) had positive PCR.

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling., METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included., RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0-10.8% vs. 33.8-75.7%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program.

We hypothesized that due to appropriate PPE use there would be no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in HCW working in high versus low risk areas. Method(s): Serum samples from 1042 randomly selected HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals, ranging from 170 to 690 beds with 121 cumulative SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at the time of the study, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG between May 26, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were characterized as high or low risk based on work location. Environmental services (EVS) workers were included but not risk-stratified. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, chronic medical conditions, symptoms, and exposures. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive in 9 of 1042 (0.86%) randomly selected HCW. Seroprevalence was lower in high risk 5/835 (0.60%) versus low risk 4/176 (2.27%) group. This was not statistically significant. No EVS workers tested positive 0/31 (0%). Of 9 HCW who tested positive, 2 had previously tested positive for SARSCoV- 2 PCR. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in a large sample of HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals was low (0.86%). Low seroprevalence among HCW in high risk areas may be related to appropriate PPE use.

","Objective: Firefighter first responders and other emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have been among the highest risk healthcare workers for illness during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We sought to determine the rate of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and of acute asymptomatic infection among firefighter first responders in a single county with early exposure in the pandemic. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study of clinically active firefighters cross-trained as paramedics or EMTs in the fire departments of Santa Clara County, California.

Method(s): All citizens above 10 years of age resident in five municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, were invited to participate in the study. Among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between 5 May and 15 May 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyser. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive results among the total number tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. Result(s): A total of 1402 participants were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least one symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those with seropositive results was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. Conclusion(s): The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was three-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially those of younger age, and people who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",2021,/,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,27,4,633,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.11.013,2010369088,#98366,Stefanelli 2021,"",""
"COVID-19 prevalence among COVID-19 exposed health care workers at a tertiary care center in San Bernardino County, CA","Valenzuela, Kathleen Louise; Wilson, April; Veltman, Jennifer ","Background: We studied the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antibody and positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among high risk health care workers at Loma Linda University Health System (LLUHS) who voluntarily obtained SARS-CoV2 antibody testing, and if indicated, antigen testing. The study determined that there is a significant decrease in the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antigen among employees at LLUH compared to the community. Method(s): Employee Health and Occupational Medicine offered antibody testing to employees who were considered high risk, primarily working in the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) designated units. We tested 658 subjects' serum for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies via the Nirmidas Qualitative SARS-CoV2 test. 29 subjects with a positive antibody test were subsequently tested for the presence of serum SARS-CoV2 antigen via PCR. Result(s): There were 31 subjects who tested positive for IgM or IgG antibodies. 11 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG. 3 subjects had negative IgM with positive IgG. 15 patients had positive IgM and positive IgG. 2 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG, were subsequently retested, and then found to have positive IgM and positive IgG. Of those 31 subjects with a positive antibody test, 2 were not tested for the COVID-19 antigen, 1 had an inconclusive test, 23 tested negative, and 5 tested positive. Of those 5 positive for the antigen, 2 had symptoms and 3 did not report symptoms or did not use the symptom questionnaire. The community prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen in San Bernardino is 0.37%, as of June 16. The prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among LLUH employees is 0.03% and the prevalence of positive antibody is 0.18%. The value of z is -7.3206, p is < .00001. Thus, the result is significant at p < .01. Conclusion(s): The results of this testing supports the efficacy of the early protective measures that LLUHS implemented in preparation for the pandemic. Such protective measures include: mandated face masks, symptoms screening, testing for SARS-CoV2 antibody or antigen on patients admitted, a dedicated COVID-19 section of the emergency department as well as inpatient units, etc. Given the statistical significance of this study, the protective bundle can be used as a template for preventative measures for future pandemics.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S291,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.640,634731629,#98896,Valenzuela 2020,"",""

Blood Samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasophareangeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed., RESULTS: the study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population, and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different than prevalence in Israel on 4th May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759, respectively).

We investigated an initially unnoticed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak linked to schools in northern France, beginning as early as mid-January 2020.AimsThis retrospective observational study documents the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, linked to an affected high school (n = 664 participants) and primary schools (n = 1,340 study participants), in the context of unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 circulation and limited control measures. Methods Between 30 March and 30 April 2020, all school staff, as well as pupils and their parents and relatives were invited for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and to complete a questionnaire covering symptom history since 13 January 2020. Results In the high school, infection attack rates were 38.1% (91/239), 43.4% (23/53), and 59.3% (16/27), in pupils, teachers, and non-teaching staff respectively vs 10.1% (23/228) and 12.0% (14/117) in the pupils' parents and relatives (p < 0.001). Among the six primary schools, three children attending separate schools at the outbreak start, while symptomatic, might have introduced SARS-CoV-2 there, but symptomatic secondary cases related to them could not be definitely identified. In the primary schools overall, antibody prevalence in pupils sharing classes with symptomatic cases was higher than in pupils from other classes: 15/65 (23.1%) vs 30/445 (6.7%) (p < 0.001).

It is unclear whether patients with seropositivity represent the subgroup with robust health status, who would be more likely to mount a durable antibody response. Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health. In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value. Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000.

Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. Implications for Practice: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.Copyright © 2020 AlphaMed Press",2021,/,Oncologist,26,4,341-347,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/onco.13654,2010148502,#97058,Zambelli 2021,"",""

However, only 7 out of 13 were confirmed as positive at the reference serological test (true positives), thus seroprevalence after cross-checking was 0.7%. No false negatives were reported. The kappa value of the consistency analysis was 0.71. Due to rapid serological test high false positive rate, its role in assessing seroconversion rate is limited, and the standard serological tests should remain the gold standard.

We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response. <h4>METHODS</h4> This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2 nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Liaison Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralising titers. <h4>RESULTS</h4> 225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years,; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p<0.05). Neutralising antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p<0.05). <h4>CONCLUSION</h4> Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralising antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting the majority of individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR307503,10.1101/2021.03.30.21254604,,#97319,Kanji 2021,"",""

Method(s): Blood donors referred to the first lockdown area in Lombardy Region and the neighbouring area were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific antibodies during the period 18 March to 24 June 2020. Serum samples were analysed using both a chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and a neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) assay. Result(s): In the period from 18 March to 24 June, 1922 blood donors were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 blood donors were tested in parallel with a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification was correlated with NT-Abs titres. In 78.2% of participants the NT-Abs titre was maintained, but in 15.8% it decreased by one four-fold dilution and in 6.0% it increased by one four-fold dilution. Conclusion(s): The duration of immunity of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the course of the pandemic and for this reason the monitoring of NT Abs is important.

Over the course of time, the progression in the number of clinical cases has appeared to be lower than expected, although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has been somewhat limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Congolese population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville who were willing to know their COVID-19 infection status. Method(s): Oropharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected from 754 healthy volunteers between April 2020 and July 2020. The samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative RT-PCR assay, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected using two different rapid tests. Result(s): A total of 56 participants (7.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 698 participants (92.6%) had negative RT-PCR results; of these, 117 were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. For these RT-PCR-negative subjects, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM was found to increase over time: from 1.7% and 2.5% in April, up to 14.2% and 17.6% in July, respectively. In April 2020, 5% of the women were found to have IgG or IgM antibodies, whereas the antibodies were not detected in any of the men. The seroprevalence in RT-PCR negative subjects was significantly higher in women within IgG (P = 0.012) and IgM (P = 0.045) over the first three months. Conclusion(s): The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2021,/,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,106,"(Batchi-Bouyou, Lobaloba Ingoba, Ndounga, Vouvoungui, Mfoutou Mapanguy, Boumpoutou, Ntoumi) Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Medicale (FCRM), Brazzaville, Congo(Batchi-Bouyou, Lobaloba Ingoba, Mfoutou Mapanguy, Ntoumi) Faculty of Sciences and Techno",3-7,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.065,2011576638,#97296,Ndounga 2021,"",""

We present results of consecutive population-based seroprevalence surveys performed in Denmark in 2020. <h4>Methods</h4> Invitation letters including a questionnaire covering symptoms were sent to representatively drawn samples of the population in spring, late summer and autumn/winter of 2020. Blood samples from participants taken at public test-centers were analyzed for total Ig and seroprevalence estimates per population segment calculated and compared to other surveillance parameters. <h4>Results</h4> From 34,081 participating individuals (response rate 33%), we obtained seroprevalence estimates increasing from 1.1% (95%CI: 0.7%–1.7) in May to 4.0 % (95%CI: 3.4%–4.7%) in December 2020. By December 2020, 1.5% of the population 12 years and older had tested positive by PCR. Seroprevalence estimates were roughly 3 times higher in those aged 12-29 compared to 65+ and higher in metropolitan municipalities.

Coronavirus disease 2019 and first-trimester spontaneous abortion: a case-control study of 225 pregnant patients,"Cosma, Stefano; Carosso, Andrea R.; Borella, Fulvio; Carosso, Marco; Bovetti, Marialuisa; Benedetto, Chiara; Cusato, Jessica; Filippini, Claudia; D'Avolio, Antonio; Di Perri, Giovanni; Ghisetti, Valeria ","Background: The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 and classified as a global public health emergency. The evidence related to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy is limited to the second and third trimester of pregnancy, whereas data on the first trimester are scant. Many viral infections can be harmful to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of them is still unknown. Objective(s): With this study, we evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a risk factor for early pregnancy loss in the first trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, coronavirus disease 2019 course in the first trimester was assessed. Study Design: Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among pregnant women in their first trimester, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n=125). Current or past infection was determined by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swab and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies in a blood sample. Patient demographics, coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected. Result(s): Of 225 women, 23 (10.2%) had a positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (P=.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that coronavirus disease 2019 was not an independent predictor of early pregnancy loss (odds ratio, 1.28; confidence interval, 0.53-3.08). Coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms in the first trimester were fever, anosmia, ageusia, cough, arthralgia, and diarrhea; no cases of pneumonia or hospital admission owing to coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms were recorded. No difference in the incidence of symptoms was noted between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not seem to predispose to early pregnancy loss; its cumulative incidence did not differ between women with spontaneous abortion and women with ongoing pregnancy.

"Antibody titers and rapid antigen testing in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia vs. staff of ICU and ""Covid-19"" wards.","Epstude, Jorg; Skiba, Marcin; Harsch, Igor Alexander","Aim: The majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are older individuals. Age and the comorbidities typically associated with it usually go hand in hand with a less favorable course of the disease. We were interested in the antibody response in this particular patient group as well as in the results of rapid antigen testing. Methods: In 30 elderly patients (>75 years), antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured, and rapid antigen testing was determined about 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results were compared with those of a ""high-risk"" group consisting of ""Covid-19"" ward regular staff, as well as with ""low-risk"" staff consisting of members of the intensive care unit (ICU). The antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 was determined by ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company); for rapid antigen testing, we used the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test (Roche R). Results: Our investigations demonstrate a robust antibody response in the majority of elderly, comorbid patients about three weeks after the onset of infection. At this timepoint, most of the results of rapid antigen testing were negative. Furthermore, in the group of employees of our clinic (""Covid-19"" ward vs. the ICU staff), the prevalence of antibodies was very low and antigen testing was negative in the whole ICU group. Conclusion:  Although frequently comorbid, elderly patients are capable of significantly increasing antibodies against COVID-19 about 3 weeks after the onset of infection. Since the viral load can be assumed to have been low at that point, rapid antigen testing was negative in most cases. In the test group of employees of our clinic (""Covid-19"" ward vs. the ICU staff), the data demonstrate that - given adequate protective measures - the risk of infection is not higher in a ""Covid-19"" ward compared to other wards.

Two patients followed the COVID-19 restricted pathway, as they were considered positive while waiting for test results. Nine patients were hospitalized one night in the hospital. On admission to the hospital before surgery, at surgery, the day after surgery and at 7 and 30 days all patients and health-care personnel showed no symptoms and resulted negative at risks factors/exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and occurrence of COVID-19.

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than ELISA (98% vs 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July-August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R=0.83, p<0.0001 and R=0.87, p<0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R=0.76, p=0.037). On repeat antibody testing three months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in gMFI of 62% vs 79% (p<0.01), for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG respectively.

Here we report testing of emergency department (ED) healthcare providers (HCP) for exposure to COVID-19 through lateral flow point of care (POC) and lab-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RTq-PCR for evidence of acute infection. 138 ED HCP were tested between May 26th (approximately one month after the peak of COVID-19 first wave of cases) and June 14th. Enrolled ED HCP represented about 70% of the total ED HCP workforce during the study period. Subjects were tested with a POC COVID-19 antibody test, and standard ELISA performed by a university based research lab. Subjects also provided a mid-turbinate swab and a saliva specimen for RTq-PCR. All subjects provided demographic information, past medical history, information about personal protective equipment (PPE) use, COVID-19 symptoms, as well as potential COVID-19 exposures during the previous 4 weeks, both in the ED, and outside the clinical setting. None of the HCP had positive RT-PCR results; 7 HCP (5%) had positive IgG for COVID-19; there was strong agreement between the lab-based ELISA (reference test) and the POC Ab test (P <= 0.0001). For the POC Ab test there were no false negatives and only one false positive among the 138 participants. There was no significant difference in demographic/ethnic variables, past medical history, hours worked in the ED, PPE use, or concerning exposures between seropositive and seronegative individuals. Moreover, there was no significant difference in reported symptoms between the two groups during the previous four weeks. The rate of COVID-19 seroconversion in our ED was 5% during the month following the pandemic's first wave. Based on questionnaire responses, differences in demographics/ethnicity, medical history, COVID-19 exposures, and PPE use were not associated with ED HCP having been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Following infection, patients receiving ICHD frequently develop circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, even with asymptomatic infection. Here, we investigated the durability and functionality of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients receiving ICHD. Three hundred and fifty-six such patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were regularly screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies, and those who became seronegative at six months were screened for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at time zero, of whom 127 also had detectable anti-RBD. Significantly, at six months, 71/111 (64.0%) and 99/116 (85.3%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive, respectively. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels were reduced significantly after six months. Eleven patients who were anti-NP seropositive at time zero, had no detectable antibody at six months; of whom eight were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at six months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following six months. Thus, patients receiving ICHD mount durable immune responses six months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with fewer than 3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity.

Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A multiple logistic regression model adjusting for ethnicity and social deprivation confirmed statistically significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses, and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk.

From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province., RESULTS: Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons). Approximately 10% of participants had detectable antibodies but showed a negative-PCR result. However, approximately 80% of participants did not show an evidence of infection., CONCLUSION: The majority of the population in Semnan province has no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Information on the number of people involved in Wuhan is still inadequate. This study aimed to describe the screening results of 61 437 community members in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Method(s): In mid-May 2020, Wuhan launched a population-scale city-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing campaign, which aimed to perform nucleic acid and viral antibody testing for citizens in Wuhan. Here we show the screening results of cluster sampling of 61 437 residents in Wuchang District, Wuhan, China. Result(s): A total of 1470 (2.39%, 95% CI 2.27-2.52) individuals were detected positive for at least one antiviral antibody. Among the positive individuals, 324 (0.53%, 95% CI 0.47-0.59) and 1200 (1.95%, 95% CI 1.85-2.07) were positive for immunoglobulin IgM and IgG, respectively, and 54 (0.08%, 95% CI 0.07-0.12) were positive for both antibodies. The positive rate of female carriers of antibodies was higher than those of male counterparts (male-to-female ratio of 0.75), especially in elderly citizens (ratio of 0.18 in 90+ age subgroup), indicating a sexual discrepancy in seroprevalence. In addition, viral nucleic acid detection using real-time PCR had showed 8 (0.013%, 95% CI 0.006-0.026) asymptomatic virus carriers. Discussion(s): The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was low.

Our first aim was to determine both the infection and seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the country's infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy., METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)- PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR COVID-19 testing.

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed., RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2-39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%-14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%-11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%-3.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.

The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020 with particularly high CFR. To estimate seroprevalence, dark figure, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged ≥14 years in June/July 2020 with misclassification error control, we conducted a population-based study, including home visits for elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests (64% of our random sample). Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, dark figure factor 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the dark figure was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for ≥85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, 13.2% for age 70+, confirming a previously reported age-model for IFR. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation.

"SARS-CoV-2 prevalence associated to low socioeconomic status and overcrowding in an LMIC megacity: A population-based seroepidemiological survey in Lima, Peru.","Reyes-Vega, Mary F; Soto-Cabezas, M Gabriela; Cardenas, Fany; Martel, Kevin S; Valle, Andree; Valverde, Juan; Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Falcon, Maria Elena; Munayco, Cesar V; Peru COVID-19 Working Group","Background: Worldwide, Peru has one of the highest infection fatality rates of COVID-19, and its capital city, Lima, accumulates roughly 50% of diagnosed cases. Despite surveillance efforts to assess the extent of the pandemic, reported cases and deaths only capture a fraction of its impact due to COVID-19's broad clinical spectrum. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Lima, stratified by age, sex, region, socioeconomic status (SES), overcrowding, and symptoms., Methods: We conducted a multi-stage, population-based serosurvey in Lima, between June 28th and July 9th, 2020, after 115 days of the index case and after the first peak cases. We collected whole blood samples by finger-prick and applied a structured questionnaire. A point-of-care rapid serological test assessed IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted by sampling weights and test performance. Additionally, we performed RT-PCR molecular assays to seronegatives and estimated the infection prevalence., Findings: We enrolled 3212 participants from 797 households and 241 sample clusters from Lima in the analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 20.8% (95%CI 17.2-23.5), and the prevalence was 25.2% (95%CI 22.5-28.2). Seroprevalence was equally distributed by sex (aPR=0.96 [95%CI 0.85-1.09, p = 0.547]) and across all age groups, including >=60 versus <=11 years old (aPR=0.96 [95%CI 0.73-1.27, p = 0.783]). A gradual decrease in SES was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=3.41 [95%CI 1.90-6.12, p<0.001] in low SES). Also, a gradual increase in the overcrowding index was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=1.99 [95%CI 1.41-2.81, p<0.001] in the fourth quartile). Seroprevalence was also associated with contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case, whether a household member (48.9%, aPR=2.67 [95%CI 2.06-3.47, p<0.001]), other family members (27.3%, aPR=1.66 [95%CI 1.15-2.40, p = 0.008]) or a workmate (34.1%, aPR=2.26 [95%CI 1.53-3.35, p<0.001]). More than half of seropositive participants reported never having had symptoms (56.1%, 95% CI 49.7-62.3)., Interpretation: This first estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Lima shows an intense transmission scenario, despite the government's numerous interventions early established. Susceptibles across age groups show that physical distancing interventions must not be relaxed. SES and overcrowding households are associated with seroprevalence.

In Moscow, the first case of the disease was detected on March 2, 2020 in a man who arrived from Italy. Two weeks after the first case, there was an exponential increase in the number of cases. The incidence peaked in the 19th week of the year, followed by a steady decline, lasting 16 weeks. Objective. To investigate the level and structure of population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the population of Moscow against the background of the incidence of COVID-19. Patients and methods. The study of population immunity of Moscow residents to SARS-CoV-2 was carried out in the period from July 1, 2020 to July 30, 2020 against the background of stabilization of the incidence rate. The work was conducted as part of the first stage of the Rospotrebnadzor project to assess population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the population of the Russian Federation, taking into account the protocol recommended by WHO. Volunteers for the study were selected by the method of questioning and randomization. The results of the survey of 2688 people were included in the analysis. The number of volunteers in all age groups was 384-385 people. The content of specific IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assya using a kit produced by FBIS SRCAMB according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results. During the survey of volunteers it was found that the share of seroprevalent residents of Moscow was 22.1%. By age groups, the highest proportion of seroprevalent was found among children aged 14-17 years (44.6%), the lowest (15.9%) - among people aged 18-29 years. Seroprevalence had no gender differences. The lowest level of herd immunity was revealed in the North-Western Administrative District (16.8%), the highest - in the South-Eastern Administrative District, as well as in the Troitsky and Novomoskovsky Administrative Districts of Moscow (in both, 24.1%). The smallest number of seropositive persons was among cultural workers (5.8%), the largest - among medical workers (27.0%). In the presence of contacts with patients with COVID-19, the probability of seroconversion increases by 1.5 times, and among convalescing persons COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 60.0% of cases. The proportion of people with asymptomatic infection among seropositive residents was 82.4%. Conclusion. The results obtained make it possible to characterize the population immunity of Moscow residents and are essential for the planning and implementation of anti-epidemic measures during the incidence of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Dynasty Publishing House.

Seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a rural district of South India: A population-based seroepidemiological study.,"Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; George, Carolin Elizabeth; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a rural district of South India, six months after the index case., METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence., RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was calculated as 12.38 per 10000 infections as on 22 October 2020. History of self-reported symptoms and education were significantly associated with positive status (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the rural population in a district of south India remains susceptible to COVID-19. A higher proportion of susceptible, relatively higher IFR and a poor tertiary healthcare network stress the importance of sustaining the public health measures and promoting early access to the vaccine are crucial to preserving the health of this population.

Design Serial SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study before and during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting Secondary school in Dresden, Germany. Participants Grade 8-12 students and their teachers were invited to participate in serial blood sampling and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assessment. Main outcome measure Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in study population. Results 247 students and 55 teachers participated in the initial study visit and 197 students and 40 teachers completed follow-up.

F.; Cook, A. R.; Leo, Y. S.; Lee, V. J. M.","Background The proportion of asymptomatic carriers and transmission risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among household and non-household contacts remains unclear. In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3,2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 en of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors. Findings Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020,7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (96.8%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 5.9% (95% CI 4-94.1) for 1779 household contacts, 1.3% (0.9-1-9) for 2231 work contacts, arid 1.3% (1.0-1.7) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 5.38 [95% CI 1.82-15.84 p=0.0023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (7.86 [3.86-16.02]; p<0.0001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 3.92 [95% CI 2.07-7.40], p<0.0001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (2.67 [1.21-5-88]; p=0.015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (3.07 [1.55-6-08]; p=0.0013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Interpretation Targeted community measures should include physical distancing and minimising verbal interactions. Testing of all household contacts, including asymptomatic individuals, is warranted.

Prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Poland.,"Kasztelewicz, Beata; Janiszewska, Katarzyna; Burzynska, Julia; Szydlowska, Emilia; Migdal, Marek; Dzierzanowska-Fangrat, Katarzyna","Data on the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in healthcare workers (HCWs) is scarce, especially in pediatric settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positivity among HCWs of a tertiary pediatric hospital. In addition, follow-up of the serological response in the subgroup of seropositive HCWs was analysed, to gain some insight on the persistence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We performed a retrospective analysis of voluntary SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing, which was made available free of charge to HCWs of the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw (Poland). Plasma samples were collected between July 1 and August 9, 2020, and tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Of 2,282 eligible participants, 1,879 (82.3%) HCWs volunteered to undergo testing. Sixteen HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 0.85%. Among seropositive HCWs, three HCWs had confirmed COVID-19. Nine (56.3%) of the seropositive HCWs reported neither symptoms nor unprotected contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the previous months. A decline in the IgG index was observed at a median time of 86.5 days (range:84-128 days) after symptom onset or RT-PCR testing. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the duration of persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as the correlation between seropositivity and protective immunity against reinfection. Regardless of the persistence of antibodies and their protective properties, such low prevalence indicates that this population is vulnerable to a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,/,PloS one,16,4,e0249550,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249550,33793673,#93377,Kasztelewicz 2021,"",""

By the beginning of March, WHO reported about 113,820,000 confirmed cases including more than 2,527,000 deaths all over the world. However, the true extent of virus circulation or its real infection/fatality ratio is not well-estimated due to the huge portion of asymptomatic infections. In this observational study, we have estimated the prevalence of specific immunoglobulin M and G directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a cohort of 1383 adult volunteers aged over 65 years old, living in the district of Benevento, in the South of Italy. Serological screening was carried out on capillary blood in September 2020, seven months after pandemic outbreak in Italy, to evaluate virus circulation and antibody response among elderly adults, in which severe symptoms due to viral infection are more common. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.70% (CI 3.70%-5.95%) with no statistically significant differences between sexes. Among these, 69.69% (CI 55.61%-77.80%) tested positive to IgM, 23.08% (CI 14.51%-34.64%) to IgG and 9.23% (CI 4.30%-18.71%) was positive for both. All patients that were positive to IgM underwent molecular testing through RT-qPCR on oral-rhino pharyngeal swabs and only one specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Instead, the presence of IgG from screened volunteers was confirmed by re-testing serum samples using both an ELISA assay validated for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD) and a recently published synthetic peptide-based ELISA assay. In conclusion, our report suggests that (1) early restrictions were successful in limiting COVID-19 diffusion in the district of Benevento; (2) rapid serological analysis is an ideal testing for both determining real seroprevalence and massive screening, whereas detection of viral RNA remains a gold standard for identification of infected patients; (3) even among people without COVID-19 related symptoms, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has individual features.",2021,/,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",11,3,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11030483,33803299,#93256,Polvere 2021,"",""

Better knowledge of the seroprevalence and immune response after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in this population is important to manage them safely during the pandemic., METHODS: 922 cancer patients, 100 non-cancer patients and 94 health care workers (HCW) attending the Multidisciplinary Oncology Unit of Antwerp University Hospital from 24th of March 2020 till 31st of May 2020, and the Oncology Unit of AZ Maria Middelares Hospital, Ghent, from 13th of April 2020 till 31st of May 2020 participated in the study. The Alinity R (A; Abbott) and Liaison R (D; DiaSorin) commercially available assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while total SARS-CoV-2 Ig was measured by Elecsys R (R; Roche)., RESULTS: In the overall study population IgG/total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in respectively 32/998 (3.2%), 68/1020 (6.7%), 37/1010 (3.7%) and of individuals using the A, D or R test. Forty-six out of 618 (7.4%) persons had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Seroprevalence in cancer patients (A:2.2%, D:6.2%, R:3.0%), did not significantly differ from that in non-cancer patients (A:1.1%, D:5.6%, R:0.0%), but was lower than the HCW (A:13%, D:12%, R:12%; respectively Fisher's exact test p = 0.00001, p = 0.046, p = 0.0004). A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was found in 6.8% of the cancer patients, 2.3% of the non-cancer patients and 28.1% of the HCW (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0004). Correlation between absolute values of the different Ig tests was poor in the cancer population. Dichotomising a positive versus negative test result, the A and R test correlated well (kappa 0.82 p McNemar test = 0.344), while A and D and R and D did not (respectively kappa 0.49 and 0.57; result significantly different p McNemar test = <0.0001 for both). The rate of seroconversion (>75%) and median absolute antibody levels (A: 7.0 versus 4.7; D 74.0 versus 26.6, R: 16.34 versus 7.32; all >P Mann Whitney U test = 0.28) in cancer patients and HCW with a positive RT-PCR at least 7 days earlier did not show any differences. However, none (N = 0/4) of the patients with hematological tumours had seroconversion and absolute antibody levels remained much lower compared to patients with solid tumours (R: 0.1 versus 37.6, p 0.003; D 4.1 versus 158, p 0.008) or HCW (all p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: HCW were at high risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Seroprevalence in cancer patients was low in the study period. Although Ig immune response in cancer patients with solid tumours does not differ from healthy volunteers, patients with hematological tumours have a very poor humoral immune response. This has to be taken into account in future vaccination programmes in this population.

Dynamics of humoral response to coronavirus antigens among employees of COVID-dedicated hospital: an observational study.,"Rzeplinski, Radoslaw; Szymanski, Piotr; Hamer, Karolina; Zdziebko, Magdalena; Szarowska, Agnieszka; Korcz, Tomasz; Zaczynski, Artur; Krol, Zbigniew; Wierzba, Waldemar","INTRODUCTION: A high priority for study during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is the safety at work of hospital staff taking care of COVID-19 patients. The authors decided to analyze the results of opportunistic screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among employees of a COVID-19-dedicated centre. Objectives: The authors aimed to investigate if potential exposition to SARS-CoV-2 antigens is reflected in the results of serological studies., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every employee who took at least one test between 21st April and 20th July was included in the study. Every test assessed levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M+A (IgM+IgA). Employees were divided in terms of having contact with COVID-19 patients and participating in aerosol-generating procedures., RESULTS: Results of 2455 tests taken by 1572 persons were analyzed. 357 (22.7%) participants had at least one positive or equivocal result during the observation period. Linear mixed models revealed gradual increases in mean levels of both IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies among employees with all negative results. The rate of change was higher among persons having direct contact with COVID-19 patients and the highest rate of change was observed among person participating in aerosol-generating procedures., CONCLUSIONS: We detected developing humoral immune response to a new set of antigens of coronavirus among studied group.

The value of rRT-PCR testing for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nursing homes (NH) residents is not known., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (i) atypical symptoms may predict rRT-PCR results and (ii) rRT-PCR results may predict immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents., DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal study., SETTING: eight NHs with at least ten rRT-PCR-positive residents., SUBJECTS: 456 residents., METHODS: Typical and atypical symptoms recorded in residents' files during the 14 days before and after rRT-PCR testing were analyzed. Residents underwent blood testing for IgG-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 6 to 8 weeks after testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared symptoms and immunization rates in rRT-PCR-positive and negative residents., RESULTS: 161 residents had a positive rRT-PCR (35.3%), 17.4% of whom were asymptomatic before testing. Temperature > 37.8degreeC, oxygen saturation < 90%, unexplained anorexia, behavioural change, exhaustion, malaise, and falls before testing were independent predictors of a further positive rRT-PCR. Among the rRT-PCR-positive residents, 95.2% developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vs 7.6% in the rRT-PCR-negative residents. Among the residents with a negative rRT-PCR, those who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies more often had typical or atypical symptoms (p = 0.02 and < 0.01, respectively)., CONCLUSION: This study supports a strategy based on (i) testing residents with typical or unexplained atypical symptoms for an early identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases, (ii) rT-PCR testing for identifying COVID-19 residents, (iii) repeated wide-facility testing (including asymptomatic cases) as soon as a resident is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and (iv) implementing SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures in rRT-PCR-negative residents when they have unexplained typical or atypical symptoms.

Diagnostic value of igm and igg detection in covid-19 diagnosis by the mobile laboratory b-life: A massive testing strategy in the piedmont region,Nyabi O.; Bentahir M.; Ambroise J.; Bearzatto B.; Chibani N.; Smits B.; Durant J.F.; Vybornov A.; Thellin O.; Moualij B.E.; Gala J.-L. ,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in 2019. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to have devastat-ing consequences for human lives and the global economy. The B-LiFe mobile laboratory in Pied-mont, Italy, was deployed for the surveillance of COVID-19 cases by large-scale testing of first responders. The objective was to assess the seroconversion among the regional civil protection (CP), police, health care professionals, and volunteers. The secondary objective was to detect asympto-matic individuals within this cohort in the light of age, sex, and residence. In this paper, we report the results of serological testing performed by the B-LiFe mobile laboratory deployed from June 10 to July 23, 2020. The tests included whole blood finger-prick and serum sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was approximately 5% (294/6013). The results of the finger-prick tests and serum sample analyses showed moderate agreement (kappa = 0.77). Furthermore, the detection rates of serum antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and S-RBD among the seroconverted individuals were positively correlated (kappa = 0.60), at least at the IgG level. Seroprevalence studies based on serological testing for the S-RBD protein or SARS-CoV-2 NP antibodies are not sufficient for diagnosis but might help in screening the population to be vaccinated and in determining the duration of seroconversion.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Emerging data describe a milder or asymptomatic course in children compared with adults in this scenario. We present the seroprevalence and clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 in a prospective cohort of 114 immunosuppressed children and adolescents from three groups: kidney transplantation, liver transplantation, and cancer patients. Among the thirty-five (30.7%) patients who had a positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2, 77% did not report previous symptoms and none of them developed any complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 30 or more days of follow-up. Among those who were symptomatic, diarrhea, fever, and cough were the most common findings. Conclusion: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is high among immunosuppressed children and adolescents. COVID-19 has a mild or asymptomatic course in most of these patients. What is Known: * The number of immunosuppressed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing. * Viral infections have the potential for greater severity in immunocompromised children.

Performance of a Point of Care Test for Detecting IgM and IgG Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 and Seroprevalence in Blood Donors and Health Care Workers in Panama.,"Villarreal, Alcibiades; Rangel, Giselle; Zhang, Xu; Wong, Digna; Britton, Gabrielle; Fernandez, Patricia L; Perez, Ambar; Oviedo, Diana; Restrepo, Carlos; Carreirra, Maria B; Sambrano, Dilcia; Eskildsen, Gilberto A; De La Guardia, Carolina; Flores-Cuadra, Julio; Carrera, Jean-Paul; Zaldivar, Yamitzel; Franco, Danilo; Lopez-Verges, Sandra; Zhang, Dexi; Fan, Fangjing; Wang, Baojun; Saez-Llorens, Xavier; DeAntonio, Rodrigo; Torres-Atencio, Ivonne; Blanco, Isabel; Subia, Fernando Diaz; Mudarra, Laiss; Benzadon, Aron; Valverde, Walter; Lopez, Lineth; Hurtado, Nicolas; Rivas, Neyla; Jurado, Julio; Carvallo, Aixa; Rodriguez, Juan; Perez, Yaseikiry; Morris, Johanna; Luque, Odemaris; Cortez, David; Ortega-Barria, Eduardo; Kosagisharaf, Rao; Lleonart, Ricardo; Li, Chong; Goodridge, Amador","Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in 1 year. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing, and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay's ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence estimates of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test positive and negative percentage agreement as well as the Kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a Kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811-0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement [87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)] was observed at >=15 days post-symptom onset (PSO). We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

We sought to determine whether infliximab-treated patients with IBD have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections., DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin alpha4beta7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020., RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2-5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2-76.1), p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is associated with attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were further blunted by immunomodulators used as concomitant therapy. Impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection might have important implications for global public health policy and individual anti-TNF-treated patients.

Universal COVID-19 screening of 4040 health care workers in a resource-limited setting: an Egyptian pilot model in a university with 12 public hospitals and medical centers,Mostafa A.; Kandil S.; El-Sayed M.H.; Girgis S.; Hafez H.; Yosef M.; Saber S.; Ezzelarab H.; Ramadan M.; Afifi I.; Hassan F.; Elsayed S.; Reda A.; Fattuh D.; Mahmoud A.; Mansour A.; Sabry M.; Habeb P.; Ebeid F.S.; Saleh A.; Mansour O.; Omar A.; El-Meteini M. ,"BACKGROUND: The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs), particularly in resource-limited settings, remains unclear. To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt. METHOD(S): Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests. RESULT(S): Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n=54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever >=38degreeC and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n=116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0). CONCLUSION(S): The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

HCWs had blood samples taken every 2 weeks to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two different types of assay. Result(s): Forty-nine participants (31 nurses, 15 doctors, 3 other workers) were enrolled. In total, 112 blood samples are obtained from participants. The median work days in 2 weeks was 9 (interquartile range (IQR): 5-10) days. In a single work day, 30 of the 49 participants (61.5%) had contact with patients with suspected or conformed SARS-CoV-2 at least 8 times, and approximately 60% of participants had more than 10 min of contact with a single patient. The median self-reported compliance to PPE was 90% (IQR: 80-100%). Seven participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, none were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, so the positive ELISA results were assumed to be false-positive.

It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults., Objective: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used 31426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years., Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years)., Results: Among 31426 antibody test results (19797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = -0.45, P < .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P < .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = -0.51; P < .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P < .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P < .001).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G antibody: Seroprevalence among contacts of COVID-19 cases.,"Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay Kirtikumar; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal; Serosurveillance Research Team*","Background: Multiple serosurveillance studies have focused on the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the general population and confirmed cases. However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings., Objectives: The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics., Methods: Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors., Results: With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01)., Conclusion: Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases.

Seroprevalence of SARS-Coronavirus 2 among asymptomatic healthy blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare settings: Implications for safety of blood donors and blood collection staff during blood donation.,"Pandey, Hem Chandra; Dhiman, Yashaswi; C S, Chippy; Coshic, Poonam; Jain, Pankaj","INTRODUCTION: SARS-Coronavirus-2 pandemic has adversely affected blood supply as potential blood donors were afraid of acquiring infection in hospital settings. We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed., RESULTS: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or non-containment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %)., CONCLUSION: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups. The findings should instil confidence among blood donors and motivate them to donate blood without fear. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim(s): To determine the prevalence of seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 among HCW in a tertiary COVID-19 designated hospital in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted between 1st July to 31st July, 2020 on 1333 HCWs. HCWs included doctors, nurses, lab personnel, general service assistants and ancillary staff who work in hospital. Anti SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies were measured in serum sample by chemiluminescent technique. Result(s): Prevalence of seropositivity was found in 27.76% (370 out of 1333). It was highest among general service assistant 34.76% (especially among house keeping staff, 43.44%) and lowest among doctors (19.33%). The percentage of seropositivity among asymptomatic HCWs was 24.84%. Conclusion(s): The percentage of seropositivity among asymptomatic HCWs indicates that a large amount of infection passes asymptomatically. The discrepancy between various job categories might be due to differential occupational exposure and risk, lack of awareness and seriousness regarding transmission and risk of getting infection, various demographic factors like literacy, residential environment, community prevalence etc.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Seropositivity was higher in females (35%) than in males (30%) overall and in nearly every age group. In these 12 cities, seroprevalence rose from about 18% in July to 41% by December, with steeper increases at ages <20 and 20-44 years than at older ages. The “M-shaped” age pattern is consistent with intergenerational transmission. Areas of higher childhood measles vaccination in earlier years had lower seropositivity. The patterns of increase in seropositivity and in peak cases and deaths varied substantially across cities. In Delhi, death rates and cases first peaked in June and again in November; Chennai had a single peak in July. Based local IFRs and COVID deaths (adjusted for undercounts), we estimate that 43%-65% of adults above age 20 had been infected (range of mid-estimates of 12%-77%) corresponding 26 to 36 million infected adults in these cities, or an average of 9-12 infected adults per confirmed case. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Even with relatively low death rates, the large cities of India had remarkably high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in six districts in Zambia in July, 2020: a cross-sectional cluster sample survey",Mulenga L.B.; Hines J.Z.; Fwoloshi S.; Chirwa L.; Siwingwa M.; Yingst S.; Wolkon A.; Barradas D.T.; Favaloro J.; Zulu J.E.; Banda D.; Nikoi K.I.; Kampamba D.; Banda N.; Chilopa B.; Hanunka B.; Stevens T.L.; Shibemba A.; Mwale C.; Sivile S.; Zyambo K.D.; Makupe A.; Kapina M.; Mweemba A.; Sinyange N.; Kapata N.; Zulu P.M.; Chanda D.; Mupeta F.; Chilufya C.; Mukonka V.; Agolory S.; Malama K. ,"BACKGROUND: Between March and December, 2020, more than 20000 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Zambia. However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHOD(S): Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 18.2 years (IQR 7.7-31.4) and 50.6% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 10.6% (95% CI 7.3-13.9). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 7.6% (4.7-10.6) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.1% (1.1-3.1). An estimated 454708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312705-596713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission. FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Serological survey is an useful tool for vulnerability mapping in an infectious disease pandemic. The aim of the current study was to assess seroprevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants among HCWs of a tertiary healthcare facility of India. It was an observational study, cross-sectional in design conducted among 919 HCWs of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India during September, 2020. In results, IgG seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among the study subjects was 13.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-15.6%]. In univariate logistic regression analysis; gender, occupation, place of posting, use of full personal protective equipment (PPE), prior corona virus disease (COVID)-19 infection, influenza like illness (ILI), use of steam inhalation, consumption of azithromycin, zinc and vitamin C were the significant attributes which affected the IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. In the multivariable logistic regression model; occupation, place of posting, prior COVID-19 infection and ILI were significant determinants of IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. To con-clude, majority of the HCWs were found to be IgG seronegative for SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies., METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken., FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78.2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5.6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6.92% (95% CI 6.41-7.43) in the population. 437 (82.1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13.0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15.8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39.8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44.6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41.2%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5.6 [IQR 1/2.0 to 1/14.0] at baseline vs 1/5.6 [1/4.0 to 1/11.2] at first follow-up [p=1.0] and 1/6.3 [1/2.0 to 1/12.6] at second follow-up [p=0.29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89.7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92.1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90.9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals)., INTERPRETATION: 6.92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39.8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies.

Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination: A method comparison of two different commercially available serological assays from the same manufacturer.,"Mueller, Thomas","BACKGROUND: We compared two serological assays from Roche Diagnostics in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination, namely the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (detecting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (detecting antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays., RESULTS: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection., CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine.

We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1,404 healthcare workers (41 +/- 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. Additionally, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID-19-indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1,404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID-19, even if the PCR testing rate was low.

However, this has been difficult to quantify at the population level due to a lack of reliably defined seroreactivity thresholds. Using an orthogonal antibody testing approach, we estimated that ~0.6% of non-triaged adults from the greater Vancouver area, Canada between May 17th and June 19th 2020 showed clear evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjusting for false-positive and false-negative test results. Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determine that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domains (NTD) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This sero-reactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike, and to conserved non-structural viral proteins. We conclude that most adults display pre-existing antibody cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, which further supports investigation of how this may impact the clinical severity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses.",2021,/,JCI insight,,101676073,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.146316,33720905,#90514,Majdoubi 2021,"",""

The aim of the current analysis was to assess the usefulness of the rapid serological tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rapid serological tests detecting IgG/IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were voluntarily performed in asymptomatic employees of 2 companies. The examination was conducted at the date and time selected online by the study participants. The testing team consisted of 2 nurses collecting the samples and 1 doctor who interpreted the results. Each positive rapid test result was verified by an RT-PCR examination from a nasopharyngeal swab. The testing kits named Vazyme: 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold-Based) were provided by the employer along with the manual and certificates., RESULTS: The overall interest in testing among employees was below the employer's expectations and reached 30% and 20% in each of the 2 companies, respectively. A total of 516 participants were included in the analysis. Ten positive results of the rapid tests were documented, including 7 for IgM and 3 for IgG antibodies. No positive result was confirmed by the detection of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR examination., CONCLUSIONS: Herein, the authors demonstrated the uselessness of rapid serological tests performed in asymptomatic volunteers for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 Long Term Care Facilities (VIVALDI study),"Krutikov, Maria; Palmer, Tom; Tut, Gokhan; Fuller, Chris; Shrotri, Madhumita; Williams, Haydn; Davies, Daniel; Irwin-Singer, Aidan; Robson, James; Hayward, Andrew; Moss, Paul; Copas, Andrew; Shallcross, Laura","<h4>Background</h4> SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major challenge for Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and many residents and staff are now sero-positive following persistent outbreaks. We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population. <h4>Methods</h4> Prospective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF. <h4>Findings</h4> Study inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection. <h4>Funding</h4> UK Government Department of Health and Social Care <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and MedRxiv on 18 January 2021 for studies in LTCFs that described the risk of infection in individuals who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to individuals who were seronegative. Search terms were deliberately broad to improve capture of relevant literature and included “SARS-CoV-2”OR “COVID-19” OR “coronavirus” AND “care home” OR “nursing home” OR “long term care facility” with no date or language restrictions. We did not identify any publications that focussed on risk of reinfection in seropositive individuals, but subsequent to our search one study has been published using data from two LTCFs in London, UK. This study reported a 96% reduction in the odds of reinfection in individuals who were seropositive compared to those who were seronegative based on 4-month follow-up in 161 participants. We found 10 studies that performed seroprevalence surveys in either staff or staff and residents in LTCFs in 8 cohorts. Five of these were carried out in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within the care homes, either as part of the subsequent investigation or as post-infection surveillance. The largest of these, which enrolled both staff and residents, was performed in 6 LTCFs and performed longitudinal antibody testing. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We undertook a cohort study in staff and residents from 100 LTCFs in England to investigate whether individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection could be infected twice. Staff and residents were offered up to three rounds of antibody testing and antibody results were linked to PCR test results which were obtained weekly from staff and monthly from residents through the national SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. This study, which was conducted in >2000 staff and residents, suggests that antibodies provide high levels of protection against reinfection for up to 10 months. Almost all cases of reinfection were symptomatic, but no cases required hospital treatment. Amongst those with detectable baseline antibodies, quantitative antibody titres against spike protein and nucleocapsid were comparable between cases of reinfection and those who did not become reinfected. <h4>Implications of all available evidence</h4> Despite high background rates of infection in LTCFs, the overall risk of reinfection was low in this population. This is broadly consistent with findings from large cohort studies of hospital staff, but, importantly, extends the evidence of substantial protection to frail elderly, who are vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 due to age-related changes in immunity (immune-senescence) and high levels of comorbidity. The low risk of reinfection in our study suggests identification of immune correlates of protection in this population will require pooling of data across multiple cohorts. As vaccination coverage in residents approaches 100% in England, it will be important to understand whether vaccination and natural infection provide comparable levels of protection against infection. Such insights will inform future policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in LTCF, and the longer-term need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as asymptomatic testing and visitor restrictions.",2021,,,,,,PPR294758,10.1101/2021.03.08.21253110,,#89049,Krutikov 2021,"",""

Following re-opening, schools resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks. During this phase, we aimed at assessing, among students and teachers, infection status, symptoms, individual behaviour, and institutional infection prevention measures. Twenty-four primary and secondary school classes, randomly selected across Berlin, were examined. Oronasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household characteristics, leisure activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, facemask wearing, and institutional preventive measures were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed. Among 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%). Compared to pre-pandemic times, screen time (e.g., TV, gaming, social media) increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity (42.2%). Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, acceptance of adapted health behaviors was high. In this post-lockdown period of low SARS-CoV2 incidence in Berlin, individual and school-level infection prevention measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance and continued preventive measures are essential to cope with future pandemic activity.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20th and 30th, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%. Of the serology positive samples, 100 samples were further tested using the SAS2pp neutralization assay; 92 (92%) samples showed neutralization activity. The seropositivity rate in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is low and varies across different regions with higher positivity in case-hospitals than control-hospitals. The lack of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 8% of the tested samples could mean that assay is a more sensitive assay or that neutralization assay has a lower detection limits; or possibly that some samples had cross-reaction to spike protein of other coronaviruses in the assay, but these were not specific to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease,99,3,115273,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115273,2010257316,#89783,Alserehi 2021,"",""
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 prevalence in saliva and gastric and intestinal fluid in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy in coronavirus disease 2019 endemic areas: Prospective cross-sectional study in Japan,Miyake S.; Ashikari K.; Kato S.; Takatsu T.; Kuwashima H.; Kaneko H.; Nagai K.; Watari I.; Sato T.; Yamaoka Y.; Yamamoto T.; Ryo A.; Maeda S.; Nakajima A.; Higurashi T. ,"Objectives: Gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) is useful for the early detection and treatment of many diseases; however, GIE is considered a high-risk procedure in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era. This study aimed to explore the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids to which endoscopy medical staff are exposed. Method(s): The study was a single-center cross-sectional study. From June 1 to July 31, 2020, all patients who underwent GIE at Yokohama City University Hospital were registered. All patients provided 3 mL of saliva. For upper GIE, 10 mL of gastric fluid was collected through the endoscope. For lower GIE, 10 mL of intestinal fluid was collected through the endoscope. The primary outcome was the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids. We also analyzed serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and patients' background information. Result(s): A total of 783 samples (560 upper GIE and 223 lower GIE samples) were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on saliva samples did not show any positive results in either upper or lower GIE samples. However, 2.0% (16/783) of gastrointestinal fluid samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences in age, sex, purpose of endoscopy, medication, or rate of antibody test positivity were found between PCR positive and PCR negative cases. Conclusion(s): Asymptomatic patients, even those with no detectable virus in their saliva, had SARS-CoV-2 in their gastrointestinal tract.

Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and anxiety level about COVID-19 were determined. Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment., RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001).

Concerning the danger of disease contagion, it is necessary to detect asymptomatic or mild cases, especially in hospital staff who are highly exposed to the disease. Objective(s): In this serosurvey study, we aimed to estimate IgG seroprevalence among hospital staff in two public hospitals to determine local transmission and infection risk factors, as well as protective immunity among high-risk populations. Method(s): Screening was offered to the hospital staff of two public hospitals in Shiraz, Iran. Screening involved the measurement of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Besides, a checklist that consisted of questions about sociodemographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics was completed by the participants. Result(s): Among 494 participants in this study, 29 (5.8%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in their blood. Besides, 320 (64.8%) had at least one of the clinical symptoms within six months before this survey. Among participants with positive PCR, nine (21.4%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while this figure was seven (33.3%) for individuals with positive CT scans. Non-proper disposal of used protective equipment or infectious wastes (OR = 26.5), rotational daily work shifts (OR = 7.5), being anxious about getting COVID-19 (OR = 3.8), and age (OR = 1.06) were the significant determinants of having anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the hospital staff.

We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England., METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers were recruited across three English regions and tested monthly from March to November 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies using five different immunoassays. In positive individuals, antibody responses and long-term trends were modelled using mixed effects regression., FINDINGS: In total, 2246 individuals attended 12,247 visits and 264 were seropositive in >=2 assays. Most seroconversions occurred between March and April 2020. The assays showed >85% agreement for ever-positivity, although this changed markedly over time. Antibodies were detected earlier with Abbott (N) but declined rapidly thereafter. With the EuroImmun (S) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) assays, responses increased for 4 weeks then fell until week 12-16 before stabilising. For Roche (N), responses increased until 8 weeks, stabilised, then declined, but most remained above the positive threshold. For Roche (S), responses continued to climb over the full 24 weeks, with no sero-reversions.

However, prevalence of infection among these groups is unknown. METHOD(S): Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for RT-PCR and serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on mortuary and cemetery workers in Qatar. We gathered data on specific job duties, living conditions, contact history, and clinical course. Environmental sampling was carried out to explore any association with infection. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with infection. RESULT(S): All 47 mortuary workers provided a NPS and 7(14.9%) were PCR-positive; 32 provided a blood sample and 8 (25%) were antibody positive, 6 (75%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided a NPS and 5 (6.6%) were PCR-positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, 3 (13.6%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Three (22.2 %) and 20 (83.3%) of infected mortuary and cemetery were asymptomatic. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95%CI 1.7-14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7-13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95%CI 1.9-42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35.

Specifically, 18.7% of seropositive KTR and 1.1% of the entire cohort were asymptomatic. Household exposure was found to markedly increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission., CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in KTR living in one of the France's highest risk zone for Covid-19 during the first French lockdown was as low as 6.3%.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they also keep the pressure off hospitals. PHCPs are assumed to be at high risk of a COVID-19 infection, as they are exposed to a large portion of the population (usually with less personal protective equipment than other frontline health care workers(HCWs)). Nevertheless, previous seroprevalence studies focussed on the general population or HCWs in hospital settings, rather than PHCPs. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PHCPs after the first and during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave in Flanders (Belgium) and compare it to the seroprevalence in the general population (blood donors). A prospective cohort of PHCPs, mainly GPs (n=698) was screened for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at five different time-points (June-December 2020). The dried blood spots they produced were analysed using a Luminex multiplex immunoassay. The seroprevalence of PHCPs remained stable between June and September 2020 (4.6-5.0%), but increased significantly from October to December (8.1-13.4%) 2020. The seroprevalence of PHCPs was not significantly higher than the seroprevalence of the blood donors at the end of December 2020. In conclusion, the sharp increase in seroprevalence during the second COVID-19 wave in Flanders shows that PHCPs were more at risk during the second wave compared to the first one. However, the increase was in line with the general population suggesting that PHCPs mainly got infected in their private settings.",2021,,,,,,PPR303142,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254327,,#93069,Marien 2021,"",""
"Detection of IgM, IgG and SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the personnel of the University of Milan, March through May 2020: the UNICORN study.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Rota, Federica; Favero, Chiara; Dioni, Laura; Manenti, Alessandro; Hoxha, Mirjam; Pariani, Elena; Albetti, Benedetta; Pesatori, Angela Cecilia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Bollati, Valentina; UNICORN Consortium investigators","OBJECTIVES: In Italy, the pandemic of COVID-19 resulted in congestion of hospitals and laboratories and probably determined an underestimation of the number of infected subjects, as the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly performed on hospitalised patients. Therefore, limited data are available about the number of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in the general population across time. To understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, we have developed a cross-sectional study (the 'UNIversity against CORoNavirus study') to investigate infection trends in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020., PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 2023 subjects asymptomatic at the enrolment., PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A nasal mid-turbinate swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and blood specimen for testing serum antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) were collected., RESULTS: Subjects showing positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig is 237 (11.7%). Only 1.2% (n=25) of the total population had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the large majority (21/25) of them were observed in March. A total of 226 subjects (11%) had IgM (n=19; 0.9%), IgG (n=155; 7.7%) or both (n=52; 2.6%) against SARS-CoV-2. Subjects with a present or past SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ from other subjects as regards the number of cohabiting family members, travels, fever and upper and lower respiratory infection episodes., CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study support the hypothesis that the actual spread of the virus in Lombardy was underestimated in the official records. However, as it is not known how long Ig persist, numbers should be taken cautiously. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 in a health workers population in Nouakchott-Mauritania,Salem M.L.O.; Sidiya M.A.M.M.; Eibih A.B.A.; Maouloud M.M.; Ngaide B.H.; Dedy L.; Hamza L.M.; Yacoub F. ,"The first outbreak of epidemic respiratory disease due to unknown etiology was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) firstly used the term ""new coronavirus 2019"" on December 29, 2019. This pandemic, which is currently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was subsequently called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all employees of the Nouakchott National Hospital Center (CHN). The study was conducted during the week 20/05/2020 to 27/05/2020. It involved 853 employees of all ranks (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, secretaries, security personnel, administrators...) of whom 504 were male and 331 were female, with a sex ratio of 1,52 with an average age of 39 years, ranging from 20 to 60 years. The screening for IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Biotime (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) immunochromatographic technique. Out of 835 employees included in our study, 14 were positive (1.67%) of whom 12 had IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 2 had isolated IgM. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in these 14 patients and was positive in six. While PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in particular rapid tests (RDTs) are a diagnostic complement to COVID-19. They have the advantage of being easy to realize, of being safe both in the laboratories and outside the laboratories. RDTs enabled us to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within CHN employees.

Methods We analyzed the national COVID-19 database that contains data regarding COVID-19 testing, management, and clinical outcomes in Duhok. For this study, different subdistricts within each district of Duhok were considered distinct clusters. Blood samples were collected from and questionnaires were administered to eligible and consenting participants who were members of different families from the subdistricts. Immunoassays were conducted to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the associations between certain variables were investigated. Results The average number cases of COVID-19 before November 2020 was 23141 ± 4364, which was significantly higher than the average number of cases between November 2020 and February 2021 (3737 ± 2634; P = 0.001). A total of 743 individuals agreed to participate and were enrolled in the study. Among the participants, 465/743 (62.58%) were found to have antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Among the participants with antibodies, 262/465 (56.34%) denied having any history of COVID-19-related symptoms. The most common symptom was fever (81.77%), followed by myalgia (81.28%). We found that antibody levels increased steadily with age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.117; P = 0.012). A significant association was found between antibody levels and the presence of symptoms (P = 0.023; odds ratio = 1.0023; 95% confidence interval = 1.0002-1.0061). Conclusions A significant reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases was observed. This might be due to the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Duhok. However, infection-prevention measures should be followed as it remains unclear whether acquired immunity is protective against reinfection. It expected that the infection rates during the next wave will not be as high as the first wave due to the high infection rate in the society.",2021,,,,,,PPR303244,10.1101/2021.03.23.21254169,,#93085,Hussein 2021,"",""

The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity in IBD patients followed at our referral center. The role of treatments for IBD and risk factors for infection were also evaluated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, all IBD patients followed at our referral centre between May 27th and July 21st, 2020 and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Specific IgG antibodies were evaluated by a commercial ELISA kit and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was performed in seropositive patients., RESULTS: Two-hundred and eighteen patients, 128 Crohn's disease (CD) and 90 Ulcerative colitis (UC) [age 44, (19-77) years; ongoing biologics in 115 (52.7%)] were enrolled. No patient had major SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 IgG were detected in 3 out of 218 (1.37%) patients with IBD (2 CD and 1 UC), all on biologics (2.6%).

Furthermore, though some previous studies have investigated the association of demographic factors such as race with SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, fewer have correlated exposure risk to surrogates for socioeconomic status such as health insurance coverage. Methods We used a highly specific serological assay utilizing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in remnant blood samples collected by the University of North Carolina Health system. We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort with Bayesian regression, as well as the association of critical demographic factors with higher prevalence odds. Findings Between April 21st and October 3rd of 2020, a total of 9,624 unique samples were collected from clinical sites in central NC and we observed a seroprevalence increase from 2.9 (1.7, 4.3) to 9.1 (7.2, 11.1) over the study period. Individuals who identified as Latinx were associated with the highest odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at 7.77 overall (5.20, 12.10). Increased odds were also observed among Black individuals and individuals without public or private health insurance. Interpretation Our data suggests that for this care-accessing cohort, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was significantly higher than cumulative total cases reported for the study geographical area six months into the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. The increased odds of seropositivity by ethnoracial grouping as well as health insurance highlights the urgent and ongoing need to address underlying health and social disparities in these populations.",2021,,,,,,PPR303156,10.1101/2021.03.25.21254320,,#93072,Lopez 2021,"",""
High seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 among healthcare workers in a north italy hospital,Airoldi C.; Patrucco F.; Milano F.; Alessi D.; Sarro A.; Rossi M.A.; Cena T.; Borre S.; Faggiano F. ,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been the key players in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. Result(s): Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55-18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%). Conclusion(s): The high seroprevalence observed can be partially explained by the timing and the population seroprevalence; the study was conducted in an area with huge spread of the infection.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

To address this, we evaluated serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (NIH-Moderna) vaccines in IBD patients enrolled in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Design We obtained sera from 48 patients who had undergone vaccination with one or two vaccine doses. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and IgG (Siemens COV2T and sCOVG assays), anti-Spike IgG (in-house ELISA), and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Roche). Results All IBD patients (15/15) who completed two-dose vaccine schedules achieved seroconversion to high levels. Two IBD patients with history of COVID-19 infections and who were seropositive at baseline seroconverted to high levels after the first dose. Concurrent biologic use was 85% (41/48), including 33% of patients (16) on TNF antagonist monotherapy, 42% (17) on vedolizumab monotherapy, 6% (3) on vedolizumab combination therapy with thiopurine, and 8% (4) ustekinumab; 1 patient was receiving guselkumab for psoriasis. Three patients (6%) were on oral steroids at the time of vaccination. Conclusion IBD patients receiving biologics can seroconvert with robust serological responses after complete Pfizer-BioNTech and NIH-Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.

Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions., PARTICIPANTS: 275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children., RESULTS: In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes. Class level explained 24% and school level 8% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models., CONCLUSIONS: With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04448717.

The registration of patients with COVID-19 in the country was carried out on the basis of the positive results of the examination for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using the PCR method. To study herd immunity, the WanTai SARS-CoV-2 Ab Rapid test (China) was used to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) in blood. In the period from August 27, 2020 to September 11, 2020, in all 14 administrative-territorial regions of Uzbekistan, blood samples of 86879 people who sought medical help at an outpatient clinic at their place of residence were tested for the presence of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. According to official figures, 0.14% of the population were infected withCOVID-19. The proportion of the population with the presence of specific protective antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 23.1%. This proves that the actual incidence of COVID-19, on the national average, was at least 165 times higher than officially reported. An uneven territorial distribution of the level of herd immunity was revealed. All regions were conditionally divided into 3 zones: 1) regions with a high level of herd immunity > 20% (8 regions), 2) regions withan average level of herd immunity < 20% and > 10% (3 regions), 3) regions with a low the level of herd immunity < 10% (3 regions). The degree of population affected in different regions of the county did not depend on the population density in the region, its age and gender composition. It was shown that the factors that influenced the intensity of the epidemic process and the formation of the level of herd immunity were the degree of external and internal migration.Copyright © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

After relaxing measures during summer, a second wave began in mid-September and extended until Christmas 2020., METHODS: We compared the main features of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two pandemic waves. We examined the information collected with rapid diagnostic tests and PCR at one university clinic in Madrid, epicenter of the pandemic in Spain., RESULTS: A total of 1569 individuals (968 during the 1st wave and 601 during the 2nd wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies using finger prick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens using either oral swab or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time tested persons was 12.6% during the 1st wave and 7.7% during the 2nd wave (p < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions were noticed within 6 months at low rates, both below 5%. Positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen during the 2nd wave was recognized in 3.5% of tested individuals, being two cases considered as reinfections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion during the first wave compared to the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of year 2020 was around 20%. Seroreversions within six months occurred in 4%. Seroconversions and reinfections during the second wave were clinically less severe than during the 1st wave. Hypothetically, promotion of wider face masking, outdoor activities, and gathering restrictions during the 2nd wave most likely contributed to reduced exposures to large size inoculum.

Transmission of infection among health care personnel performing surgical tracheostomies on COVID-19 patients.,"Angamuthu, Natarajan; Geraldine Gagasa, Emelia; Baker, Daryll; Tsui, Janice; Evan D'Souza, Rovan","BACKGROUND: Staff and patient safety are of paramount importance while performing a surgical tracheostomy (ST) during the corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 infection among the healthcare personnel (HCP) performing ST on COVID-19 patients., METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two HCP participating in 71 ST procedures performed at our institution between 26th March 2020 and 27th May 2020 were identified. A COVID-19 health questionnaire was distributed among staff with their consent. Data related to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (new onset continuous cough, fever, loss of taste and/or loss of smell) among HCP involved in ST as well as patient related data were collected., RESULTS: Of the HCP who responded, eleven (15%,11/72) reported key COVID-19 symptoms and went into self-isolation. Ten members from this group underwent a COVID-19 swab test and three tested positive. Only one HCP attended hospital for symptomatic treatment, none required hospitalisation. Sixty percent (43/72) of the responders had a COVID-19 antibody test with a positive rate of 18.6% (8/43). Among the patients undergoing a ST, 67% (37/55) required a direct intensive care unit (ICU) admission; the mean age was 58 years (29-78) with a male preponderance (65.5%). The median time from intubation to ST was 15 days (range 5-33,IQR = 9). The overall mortality was 11% (6/55)., CONCLUSIONS: ST can be carried out safely with strict adherence to both, personnel protective equipment and ST protocols which are vital to mitigate the potential transmission of COVID-19 to the HCP.

"Safety and Effectiveness of Orthopaedic Medical Staff in Providing Support in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Investigation from Wuhan, China.","Wen, Yin-Xian; Wang, Hua; Tie, Kai; Ni, Qu-Bo; Qin, Jun; Tan, Yang; Pan, Zheng-Qi; Chen, Biao; He, Hang-Yuan; Chen, Liao-Bin","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether it is safe and effective for orthopaedic medical staff to provide support to the work against COVID-19., METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two orthopaedic medical staff from the orthopaedic center of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were included in this retrospective investigation. A total of 43 surgeons and 69 nurses provided medical support in the treatment of COVID-19 patients from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2020 in four different hospitals in Wuhan. We collected data on the age, gender, and body temperature of orthopaedic medical staff, as well as the results for their chest CT scans, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests, and training and examinations on COVID-19 knowledge. We also collected data on the time span of work, the number of infected staff during the support period, the number of COVID-19 patients the surgeons treated and the cure rate, the performance of the surgeons as assessed by the specialists and patients, and the number of infected staff during the pandemic., RESULTS: Among the 49 surgeons and 73 nurses, 43 surgeons and 69 nurses provided support against COVID-19. A total of 12 surgeons and 11 nurses provided support in the fields of respiration, intensive care, and emergency. A total of 34 surgeons and 58 nurses worked in the designated wards restructured for COVID-19 in the orthopaedic building. The average time span of work for the surgeons and nurses was 14.78 +/- 3.64 days and 24.77 +/- 7.58 days, respectively. No staff were infected during the support period. Over 1000 patients were received in the fever clinic by orthopaedic surgeons. The overall number of the treated hospitalized patients was 622. Among these patients, 226 cases were mild, 318 were mild to moderate, and 58 were severe or critical. The cure rate was 96.01%, 99.37%, and 52.00% respectively. The performance of the surgeons was scored 87.02 +/- 3.17 and 90.69 +/- 3.58 by the specialists and the patients, respectively. During the whole pandemic, 3 surgeons and 3 nurses who did not participate in the support work were infected in the early stages. The morbidity of all the orthopaedic staff was 4.92% during the whole pandemic, while no one was infected during the support work., CONCLUSION: Our investigation indicated that although they worked outside their specialty, it was safe and effective for the orthopaedic staff to provide medical support in the work against COVID-19 with adequate precautions and proper training.

Real-world experience of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in UK healthcare workers.,"Robinson, Alyss V; Weaving, Gary; Philips, Barbara J; Eziefula, Alice C; Shipman, Kate E; Chevassut, Timothy","BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers is variable throughout the world. This study compares the use of two antibody assays among large cohorts of healthcare workers in southern England., METHODS: This cohort study includes data obtained from staff at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (WSHT) and Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals (BSUH) during voluntary antibody testing, using Abbott and Roche SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays at each Trust respectively., RESULTS: The observed seroprevalence level was 7.9% for the WSHT/Abbott cohort versus 13% for the BSUH/Roche cohort. Based on a previous positive PCR, we find that the false-negative rate of the Abbott and Roche assays were 60.2% and 19% respectively, implying sensitivity levels of 39.8% and 81%. Within these cohorts, seropositivity was most strongly associated with those of South Asian ethnicity, allied health professionals and male sex (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study, neither antibody test performed to the specification level stated by the manufacturer. More rigorous testing of these and other assays in target populations is recommended prior to widespread usage if they are to provide data that might be useful to control the pandemic.

Case-Control Study of Individuals with Discrepant Nucleocapsid and Spike Protein SARS-CoV-2 IgG Results.,"Wang, Hannah; Wiredja, Danica; Yang, Lu; Bulterys, Philip L; Costales, Cristina; Roltgen, Katharina; Manalac, Justin; Yee, Jennifer; Zehnder, James; Shi, Run Zhang; Boyd, Scott D; Pinsky, Benjamin A","BACKGROUND: Laboratory-based methods for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection vary widely in performance. However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results., METHODS: Over a two-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis., RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] versus 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] versus 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6., CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies. These findings have implications for the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, especially with the advent of spike antigen-targeted vaccination, as a subset of patients with true infection are anti-N negative and anti-S1 positive.

We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees, and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using mixed-effects multivariable Poisson regression models., FINDINGS: Overall, 3'421 participants (29% of all employees) were included with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% [95%CI, 3.7-5.1] at baseline to 8.5% [95%CI, 7.6-9.5] at the last visit.

Healthcare workers have previously been shown to have experienced higher rates of infection than the general population. We aimed to assess the extent of infection in staff working in our healthcare setting., DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of antibody results, compared with staff demographic data, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection., SETTING: A large teaching hospital in the North West of England., PARTICIPANTS: 4474 staff in diverse clinical and non-patient facing roles who volunteered for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by the Roche Elecsys assay between 29 May and 4 July 2020., RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 17.4%. Higher rates were seen in Asian/Asian British (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04) and Black/Black British (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.45) staff. Staff working in any clinical location were more likely to be seropositive (OR 2.68, 95% 2.27 to 3.15). Staff were at an increased risk of seropositivity as the 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days change' increased in the clinical area in which they worked (OR 1.12, 95% 1.10 to 1.14). Staff working in critical care were no more likely to have detectable antibodies than staff working in non-clinical areas. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 41.8% and antibodies were detected in 30.7% of these individuals. In staff who reported no symptoms, antibodies were detected in 7.7%.

Healthcare workers (HCW) in radiology departments are exposed to a high infection risk similar to HCWs in the ICU or dedicated COVID wards. The goal of our paper is to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 among radiology HCWs in two different hospitals and regions in Germany with a low and high COVID-19 prevalence and to compare it to the prevalence in other clinical personnel. Additionally, we assessed the number of radiological procedures performed in patients with a positive PCR test (C+) followed by a short review of the risk for nosocomial infections of radiology HCWs., MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first COVID-19 wave between March and July 2020, we evaluated a region with one of the highest COVID-19 rates (776-1570/100 000) in Germany (Hospital A). Additionally, we assessed Hospital B in a region with a low prevalence (65/100 000). We tested the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among the whole staff with a subgroup analysis for radiology in both hospitals. We calculated the total number of different radiological procedures performed in C+ patients., RESULTS: In Hospital A 594 PCR-proven C+ patients were treated resulting in 2723 radiological procedures. 24 % (n = 6) of the radiology technicians and 13.35 (n = 2) of radiologists had a positive IgG test. The rates were similar to positive rates in HCWs in COVID-19 wards and ICUs within the hospital. The most frequently performed procedures in C+ patients were chest X-rays (3.17/patient) and CT examinations (1.15/patient). In Hospital B 50 C+ patients were treated, resulting in 64 radiological procedures. None of the HCWs tested IgG positive. The most frequently performed examinations were also chest X-rays (1.04/patient) and CT (0.2/patient)., CONCLUSION: HCWs in radiology have a high occupational infection risk similar to that of HCWs in ICUs and dedicated COVID wards., KEY POINTS: . The risk of acquiring COVID-19 increases with the amount of contact with infected individuals.. . The occupational risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection for radiology staff is similar to that of nurses and physicians in COVID wards.. . Hygiene concepts and medical resources have to be adapted for further COVID outbreaks.. .

Lower Household Transmission Rates of SARS-CoV-2 from Children Compared to Adults - Results from the FamilyCoviDD19-Study,"Galow, Lukas; Haag, Luise; Kahre, Elisabeth; Blankenburg, Judith; Dalpke, Alexander; Lück, Christian; Berner, Reinhard; Armann, Jakob Peter","Background: While lockdown and social distancing measures effectively reduce transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 in public spaces crowded indoor spaces remain a significant venue for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Analyzing seroprevalence in households with confirmed index-cases we can assess transmissibility and risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility more accurately than PCR based studies. Methods: Households with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected member in Dresden (Saxony, Germany) were invited to participate in the FamilyCoviDD19 study between June 2020 and January 2021. Personal history and characteristics of the households were obtained and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed. Findings:150 households with 414 participating household-members were enrolled. 51% of all study participants were seropositive. The secondary attack rate (SAR) in households with an index-case &amp;lt; 18 years was 0&middot;15 compared to 0&middot;38 in households with an adult index-case. In 56% of the households there was no detectable transmission. Temporal separation and mask wearing reduced transmissions as well as the likelihood of all household members being seropositive significantly. Interpretation: Household transmissions are detected more frequently by seroprevalence than observed in PCR based studies. Children and adolescents are less likely to transmit the disease compared to adults. Temporal separation and mask wearing reduces transmission rates in households significantly.

Time series analysis and mechanistic modelling of heterogeneity and sero-reversion in antibody responses to mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Manisty, Charlotte; Treibel, Thomas Alexander; Jensen, Melanie; Semper, Amanda; Joy, George; Gupta, Rishi K; Cutino-Moguel, Teresa; Andiapen, Mervyn; Jones, Jessica; Taylor, Stephen; Otter, Ashley; Pade, Corrina; Gibbons, Joseph; Lee, Jason; Bacon, Joanna; Thomas, Steve; Moon, Chris; Jones, Meleri; Williams, Dylan; Lambourne, Jonathan; Fontana, Marianna; Altmann, Daniel M; Boyton, Rosemary; Maini, Mala; McKnight, Aine; Chain, Benjamin; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Moon, James C","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 serology is used to identify prior infection at individual and at population level. Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity., METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements., FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks' follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%)., INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections. The mechanisms that underpin faster clearance and lower rates of sustained anti-S1 production may impact on the longevity of humoral immunity., FUNDING: Charitable donations via Barts Charity, Wellcome Trust, NIHR.

Clinical course of the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease 2019 (COVID-19) isextremely heterogeneous, and infected individuals may be asymptomatic or develop acuterespiratory manifestations. Elderly people and patients with pre-existing comorbidities, includingmalignancies, may be at higher risk due to their immunological impairment. On the other hand, stilllimited evidence suggests that some target drugs used to treat hematological cancers, includingtyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), may have a direct antiviral action or an indirect immunomodulatoryeect on the abnormal inflammatory host response to SARS-CoV-2. Aims. To describe the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in acohort of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Methods.This is an ongoing prospective study ideated and conducted in the Centers of the regionalnetwork Rete Ematologica Veneta (REV). According to the Italian Ministry of Health data as of Jul 22,2020, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Veneto, as documented by molecular test onpharyngeal swab, was 0.4%. For comparison, two other centers from Regions with lower prevalence(Lazio and Friuli-Venezia Giulia) were included. All consecutive CML patients coming to theparticipating Centers were oered to participate to the study, which was approved by local IRBs.Patients in Treatment Free Remission (TFR) phase (i.e. not taking TKI at the time of pandemic) were included as a control group. After collecting information about risk factors for COVID-19 (travels, work exposure, cohabitation with infected subjects) and respiratory or general symptomsexperienced from mid Feb 2020, patients were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgGantibodies through a immunochromatographic qualitative assay (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid TestCassette, Menarini Diagnostics, IT; sensitivity IgG 97.2%, IgM 87.9%, specificity IgG/IgM 100%).Patients with positive results underwent a pharyngeal swab for molecular detection of the virus. Results. From May 18 to Jul 29, 2020 a total of 339 patients were enrolled (238 from REV centers and101 from other centers). Males were 183 (54%), median age was 63.2 (range 26.5-93) years. Mediantime from CML diagnosis was 8 (range 0.1-29.6) years. The majority of patients were in frontline TKItreatment (n=174, 51.3%), and the remaining were in 2ndline (n=80, 23.6%), 3rdor further line of treatment (n=35, 10.3%), or in TFR (n=50, 14.7%). The type of TKI currently assumed was imatinib(n=134, 39.5%), nilotinib (n=63, 18.6%), dasatinib (n=52, 15.4%), bosutinib (n= 24, 7.1%), ponatinib(n=14, 4.1%) or experimental (n=2, 0.6%). The majority of patients was in major (n=79, 23.3%) or deepmolecular response (n=204, 60.2%). Thirteen and 3 patients declared close contact with COVID-19 infected individuals at work and/or athome, respectively. The frequency of newly onset or worsening symptoms during the last months was as follows: anosmia (2.4%), ageusia (2.1%), cough (4.7%), pharyngitis (2.6%), dyspnea (2.4%),fever (3.2%), headache (7.7%), asthenia (13.6%), arthralgia (14.9%), dizziness (6.5%), nausea/vomiting(2.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%). Five patients out of the 238 in the REV cohort (2.1%) had a positive IgG test, and two of them were also IgM-positive. All resulted negative at swab performed after the serological assay. They were 4males and 1 female, aged between 53 and 72 years. One of them, in treatment with nilotinib, had asymptomatic infection in early March, confirmed at that time by molecular tests, and reported close contact with infected subjects both at work and at home. All the other patients (2 in treatment with imatinib, 1 with nilotinib and 1 with bosutinib) reported no or only mild symptoms and had notperformed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 before. Anosmia, ageusia and fever were the onlysymptoms significantly associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive test (p<0.001). All the patients from the other two Regions and all the patients in TFR had a negative IgG/IgM test. Conclusions. We reported for the first time the serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection inCML patients.

SARS-CoV-2-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Responses in Norwegian Health Care Workers After the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study,Trieu M.-C.; Bansal A.; Madsen A.; Zhou F.; Saevik M.; Vahokoski J.; Brokstad K.A.; Krammer F.; Tondel C.; Mohn K.G.I.; Blomberg B.; Langeland N.; Cox R.J. ,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries experienced infection in health care workers (HCW) due to overburdened health care systems. Whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. METHOD(S): In a Norwegian prospective cohort study, we enrolled 607 HCW before and after the first COVID-19 wave. Exposure history, COVID-19-like symptoms, and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays. RESULT(S): Spike-specific IgG/IgM/IgA antibodies increased after the first wave in HCW with, but not in HCW without, COVID-19 patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with >=4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up; 8 were positive (7 seroconverted, 1 had undetectable antibodies). CONCLUSION(S): We found increases in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19 patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a low-prevalence setting; however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Peripartal anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA/IgG in asymptomatic pregnant women during regional SARS-CoV-2-outbreak.,"Hausler, Sebastian; Weigl, Marco; Ambrosch, Andreas; Gruber, Rudolf; Seelbach-Gobel, Birgit; Fill Malfertheiner, Sara","OBJECTIVES: The Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses special challenges for the society and especially the medical staff. Even if a rather mild course is assumed among pregnant women the measures to prevent transmission of the infection are of outstanding importance., METHODS: To screen asymptomatic pregnant women during admission to our university maternal hospital we focused on anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses. Hundred and fifty one women admitted to the hospital for childbirth or caesarean delivery were included. In case of suspicious anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels an RT-PCR was performed to confirm an ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2., RESULTS: A total of 89% showed negative results for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA antibodies, whereas 3% were borderline and 7% positive (both labeled as suspicious). In only one patient with suspicious serology we detected SARS-CoV-2-RNA in the following RT-PCR. 2% presented anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies, all being positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA. The observed positive rate of our study collective of 10.6% seemed much higher than the expected one (1.3%) based on the reports of the Robert Koch Institute and the specifications given by the test's manufacturer. The expected positive predictive value (PPV) was 4.3-6.7 times higher than the observed one., CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first report of anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels in the peripartum period of asymptomatic women. As the positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology poorly correlated with the confirmatory RT-PCR and the fact that mainly the detection of the virus by PCR correlates with the patient's infectiousness we suggest to rather perform a SARS-CoV-2-PCR-based admission screening in perinatal centers to prevent the spread of the disease.

Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set.

Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site., Results: Among 24749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17233 [69.6%]), were women (19361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10000 in the community up to 1 week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6).

The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination. Methods Adult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021. Results 17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 (±1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 49% and 83%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021. Conclusions Results of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.",2021,,,,,,PPR296521,10.1101/2021.03.11.21253226,,#89089,Williamson 2021,"",""

A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28,314 subjects from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias, and sampling design. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 28,314 Iranians selected, 11,256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male, and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals.

Patients were categorized as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in the database., Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end points were post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, including recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID) diagnoses or positive NAAT results and recorded comorbidities., Results: The cohort included 3257478 unique patients with an index antibody test; 56% were female with a median (SD) age of 48 (20) years. Of these, 2876773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, and 378606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test result were older than those with a positive result (mean age 48 vs 44 years). Of index-positive patients, 18.4% converted to seronegative over the follow-up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (95% CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index vs those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (95% CI, 2.73-2.97) at 0 to 30 days, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.6-0.74) at 31 to 60 days, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) at 61 to 90 days, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19) at more than 90 days., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with positive antibody test results were initially more likely to have positive NAAT results, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but became markedly less likely to have positive NAAT results over time, suggesting that seropositivity is associated with protection from infection.

It caused many deaths, not sparing health workers. The active detection of infection among health professionals is essential to ensure the safety of them and to reduce the spread of the virus. We evaluated use of the qualitative serological test in asymptomatic healthcare workers in the Sondrio Hospital. Material (patients) and methods: We analyzed 220 asymptomatic healthcare workers assessed for qualitative serological test from March 2020 to date; trial is actually ongoing. We chose qualitative NADALR COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (test cassette) REF 243001N-10, by Nal Von Minden GmbH (Germany). This is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgM in human whole blood, serum or plasma specimens. The test procedure is not automated and requires no special training or qualification. It is necessary a fingerprick blood sample and provides a qualitative result within 15 minutes. It has a high sensitivity with 94,1% and 99,2% specificity. Some of the subjects analyzed were also evaluated with quantitative serological test (Diasorin test). Result(s): 25/220 asymptomatic cases tested resulted positive to qualitative serological rapid test (Table 1), 5 of which were conniving with people positive to COVID-19 but not been swabbed. In 7/25 subject positive we had a quantitative positive IgG response; these people are found to be positive to nasopharyngeal swab. We have had 195/220 cases with qualitative negative response, in 43 of which the result of the rapid test has been confirmed by the quantitative serological test; in 152 cases the quantitative test was not carried out. Conclusion(s): Rapid qualitative serological test is ready, economic and able to identifies asymptomatic subjects who may have developed immunity.

Association between SARS-CoV-2 and exposure risks in health care workers and university employees - a cross-sectional study.,"Nygren, David; Noren, Jonas; De Marinis, Yang; Holmberg, Anna; Fraenkel, Carl-Johan; Rasmussen, Magnus","BACKGROUND: In health care workers SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be an occupational health risk, often associated with transmission between health care workers. Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Skane University Hospitals in Malmo and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact). In health care workers, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with work in a designated COVID-19-unit (OR 5.7 (95CI 2.1-16)) and caring for COVID-19-patients during the majority of shifts (OR 5.4 (95CI 2.0-15)). In all participants, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case (OR 10 (95CI 2.0-45)) in the household., CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed previous findings of elevated risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers in COVID-19-units, despite exclusion of units with known outbreaks. Interestingly, health care workers in non-COVID-19-units had similar risk as University employees. Further measures to improve the safety of health care workers might be needed.KEY POINTSPrevious findings of elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers with COVID-19 patient contact was confirmed, despite exclusion of wards with known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Early areas impacted by this pandemic in the US include Essex County, New Jersey. Beyond understanding the prevalence of active infections and deaths, it is important to understand the true burden of infection in the community, as indicated by seroprevalence of antibodies directed to the virus. Understanding the spectrum of disease is key to the effectiveness of primary prevention and control measures and the design of interventions against transmission of infection. <h4>Methods</h4> We utilized venue-based-sampling (VBS), implemented by a community partner, to sample members of the community in Essex County. In VBS the venues are randomized as a proxy for randomizing the attendees of the venues. We asked standard demographic questions, questions about symptoms and PCR testing and previous antibody testing. Participants provide a blood sample collected by finger stick with the Neoteryx Mitra Collection device. Samples were tested using a novel ELISA based approached developed by our team. <h4>Results</h4> From September 15, 2020 to December 22, 2020, we conducted 92 randomly selected sampling events where we approached 1349 individuals for screening. Of these, 924 consented and had complete data for analysis. Only 6.5% of the sample reported any COVID-19 like symptoms while 45.9% had sought out a COVID-19 test. In total 13 (1.4%) participants received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. While 33 participants (2.6%) sought a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, only 0.5% of the sample reported a positive antibody result. Testing in this study identified 83 (9.0%) participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We recruited a large sample of the population of Essex County, New Jersey using VBS, electronic surveys, novel sample collection and lab methods. Our findings suggest that the burden of SARS-Cov-2 is slightly more than six times than that suggested by PCR testing. This burden is higher than most estimates obtained through studies of remnant blood samples from hospitals (4.2%), samples from staff at a public-school system (2.9%), and residents of a California county recruited with targeted Facebook ads (1.5%). (9-11) Moreover, with only 6.5% of the sample reporting any COVID-19-like symptoms, our finding suggests that the number of asymptomatic persons may be close to 1.5 times greater than anyone reporting symptoms.",2021,,,,,,PPR292976,10.1101/2021.03.02.21252766,,#88954,Raymond 2021,"",""

Testing was performed to and a questionnaire was completed by 4592 workers on a voluntary basis. We computed the apparent IgM, IgG, and combined IgM or IgG prevalence, along with the true prevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CI) using Bayesian inference. <h4>Results</h4> We found an apparent prevalence of 3.1% for IgM, 1.0% for IgG, and 3.9% for either antibody class. The estimated true prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1-4.3) for IgM, 0.6% (95% CI 0.0-1.3) for IgG and 2.5% (95% CI 0.1-5.3) for IgM or IgG.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic myeloidleukemia,Claudiani S.; Rosadas C.; McClure M.; Khan M.; Tedder R.S.; Innes A.J.; Milojkovic D.; Apperley J. ,"Background: The new SARS-CoV-2-induced disease (COVID-19) pandemic has represented a huge challenge forthe health systems and has been responsible for almost 700.000 deaths worldwide as of 1st August2020. Older age, male sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and socioeconomic factorsare risk factors forsevere COVID-19. While the direct eect of solid cancer on the COVID-19 outcome has beeninvestigated and is still debated, limited information is available on the impact of an underlyinghematological malignancy on the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the clinical presentation and theoutcome of the infection. We report on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large cohort of patients (pts) with chronicmyeloid leukemia (CML). Method(s): We retrospectively investigated the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through serological testing in a singlecentre cohort of CML pts. Of more than 600 pts on active follow-up, we have screened 161 ptsbetween 1st June and 27th July 2020. At each consultation, we recorded any exposure to or symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 6 months. The Imperial Hybrid DABA, a two-step double antigen binding assay (DABA) for the detection and measurement of total antibody directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 w asused for analysis. The cut-o (CO) for positivity is established by adding 0.1 to the average of opticaldensity (OD) obtained for the negative controls. A sample-OD/cut-o (S/CO) value >= 1 is consideredreactive. Result(s): 161 CML pts in chronic phase underwent serological testing (median age 54 years (18-92), malen=94). Twenty pts were o TKI (post-alloSCT, n=12; in treatment free remission n=6; pregnancy=1and intolerance n=1) and 141 were on active treatment (imatinib [n=41], dasatinib [n=38], nilotinib[n=23], bosutinib [n=21], asciminib [n=11], ponatinib [n=6] and K0706 [n=1]). The ethnic distribution was White (n=119), Asian-Indian (n= 24), Asian-Chinese (n=3), Black (n=9), Arab (n=5), Mixed Asian-White (n=1). Eighteen pts (11.2%) have tested positive (Table 1). Thirty-eight pts (23.6%) reported symptomscompatible with COVID-19 of whom 12 (31.6%) were DABA positive. Six of 123 (4.9%) asymptomaticpts also tested positive. The time from onset of symptoms to the date of testing were similar in bothseropositive (105 days, range 56-180) and seronegative pts (100 days, range 21-205). The medianS/CO ratio was 9.9 (1-23.3) in the symptomatic and 1.5 (1.2-21.4) in the asymptomatic pts. Among the 18 positive pts, the median age at symptom presentation was 54 years (38-75) and 12were males. The median time from CML diagnosis was 7.6 years (0.2-20) and two pts were post-alloSCT. Ethnicity was White, Asian-Indian, Black in 8 (44.4%), 6 (33%) and 4 (22.2%), respectively. In 15 pts (83.3%) symptoms were absent or mild, moderate in 2 and severe in one patient 2 yearspost-alloSCT on continuing immunosuppression for GvHD. Only 2/18 had PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2at the time of infection and both were positive. Of the 16 pts not tested for antigen, 2 had been in close contact with a family member with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the mild cases, the most frequent symptoms were fever (n=7) and cough (n=6), followed by fatigue (n=2), myalgia(n=2) and anosmia (n=2). One patient presented only with acute limb ischemia, derived fromthrombus in the superficial femoral artery. One patient had radiological features of COVID-19pneumonia, but did not require hospitalization. The only patient with severe COVID-19 developedpneumonia requiring CPAP, was refractory to tocilizumab (anti-IL6), but recovered after startingruxolitinib (JAK2-inhibitor). The median time to complete resolution of symptoms was 21 days (7-56). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of infection in our CML pts is similar to that of the overall population, which suggeststhat they are capable of mounting appropriate antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, in seropositive pts symptoms were mild. Of note is the higher prevalence in the BAMEcommunity and underlines the potential role of socioeconomic factors in disease transmission.Expansion of this CML cohort and serial antibody testing in seropositive patients will provide furtherinformation regarding prevalence and durability of serological responses.",2020,/,Blood,136,SUPPL 1,20,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-142454,634314462,#86372,Claudiani 2020,"",""

Transmission rates vary from region to region, and are influenced by many factors including population susceptibility, travel and uptake of preventive measures. To date there have been relatively few studies examining the impact of the pandemic in poor, rural regions of India. We report on a study examining COVID-19 burden in a rural community in Tamil Nadu. <h4>Methods: </h4> The study was undertaken in a population of approximately 130000 people, served by the Rural Unit of Health and Social Affairs (RUHSA), a community health center of CMC, Vellore. We established and evaluated a COVID-19 PCR-testing programme for symptomatic patients – testing was offered to 350 individuals, and household members of test-positive cases were offered antibody testing. We also undertook two COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys in the same community, amongst 701 randomly-selected individuals. <h4>Results: </h4>: There were 182 positive tests in the symptomatic population (52.0%). Factors associated with test-positivity were older age, male gender, higher socioeconomic status (SES, as determined by occupation, education and housing), a history of diabetes, contact with a confirmed/suspected case and attending a gathering (such as a religious ceremony, festival or extended family gathering). Amongst test-positive cases, 3 (1.6%) died and 16 (8.8%) suffered a severe illness. Amongst 129 household contacts 40 (31.0 %) tested positive. The two seroprevalence surveys showed positivity rates of 2.2% (July/Aug 2020) and 22.0% (Nov 2020). 40 tested positive (31.0%, 95% CI: 23.02 -38.98). Our estimated infection-to-case ratio was 31.7. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> A simple approach using community health workers and a community-based testing clinic can readily identify significant numbers of COVID-19 infections in Indian rural population. There appear, however, to be low rates of death and severe illness, although vulnerable groups may be under-represented in our sample. It’s vital these poor, rural populations aren’t overlooked in ongoing pandemic monitoring and vaccine roll-out in India.",2021,,,,,,PPR295896,10.21203/rs.3.rs-289385/v1,,#89067,Isaac 2021,"",""

SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression. <h4>Results:</h4> Among 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early.

Material(s) and Method(s): At the end of February 2020, we developed at the hospital a strategy to diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infection consisting of complementing the realization of PCR tests at real time with a quick technique of lateral flow immunochromatography to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the virus. We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020. Result(s): 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689). Conclusion(s): The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's.

Methods In a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing. Results 13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7. Conclusion Natural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.",2021,,,,,,PPR296492,10.1101/2021.03.09.21253218,,#89083,Lumley 2021,"",""

However, little is known about which groups among the general population have been more affected. Methods: A convenience sampling strategy via online advertising recruited 3046 adults. Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related symptoms, COVID-19 testing, self-medication and prescribed medications were recorded. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were measured with an ELISA. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using cluster-corrected and adjusted Poisson&rsquo;s regression models. Results: A crude positivity rate among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, was estimated at 29.10%, with a maximum seroprevalence of 41.53% corrected by test characteristics and an antibody decay rate of 27%. Regression models demonstrated a strong association towards marginalized low-income and vulnerable residents with limited health access. Presence of a COVID-19 case (PR 1.39, 1.24-1.57) or death (PR 2.14, 1.74-2.62) in a household increased greatly the risk of other household members acquiring infection. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among those who self-medicated to prevent infection (PR 1.36, 1.27-1.46).

In April 2020 at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, one of the three oncologic hubs in Lombardy where the Health Regional Authorities referred all the cancer patients of the region, we implemented a prospective longitudinal study aimed at monitoring the serological response to SARS-Cov-2 in HCP. One hundred and ten HCP answered a questionnaire and were screened by nasopharyngeal swabs as well as for IgM/IgG levels; seropositive HCPs were further screened every 40-45 days using SARS-CoV-2-specific serology. We identified a fraction of HCP with long-term anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, though negative for viral RNA, and thus probably able to safely approach fragile cancer patients. Monitoring asymptomatic HCP might provide useful information to organize the healthcare service in a Cancer Center, while waiting for the effectiveness of the active immunization by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which will provide protection from infection.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race/ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago’s first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies. Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the comorbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.",2021,,,,,,PPR292982,10.1101/2021.03.02.21252767,,#88955,Mustanski 2021,"",""
"COVID Seroprevalence, Symptoms and Mortality During the First Wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada","=Action to beat coronavirus/Action pour battre le coronavirus (Ab-C) Study Investigators; Jha, Prabhat","<h4>Background</h4> Efforts to stem Canada’s SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can benefit from direct understanding of the prevalence, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and information on asymptomatic infection. <h4>Methods</h4> We surveyed a representative sample of 19,994 adult Canadians about COVID symptoms and analyzed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from self-collected dried blood spots (DBS) in 8,967 adults. A sensitive and specific chemiluminescence ELISA detected IgG to the spike trimer. We compared seroprevalence to deaths to establish IFRs and used mortality data to estimate infection levels in nursing home residents. <h4>Results</h4> The best estimate (high specificity) of adult seroprevalence nationally is 1.7%, but as high as 3.5% (high sensitivity) depending on assay cut-offs. The highest prevalence was in Ontario (2.4-3.9%) and in younger adults aged 18-39 years (2.5-4.4%). Based on mortality, we estimated 13-17% of nursing home residents became infected. The first viral wave infected 0.54-1.08 million adult Canadians, half of whom were <40 years old. The IFR outside nursing homes was 0.20-0.40%, but the COVID mortality rate in nursing home residents was >70 times higher than that in comparably-aged adults living in the community. Seropositivity correlated with COVID symptoms, particularly during March. Asymptomatic adults constituted about a quarter of definite seropositives, with a greater proportion in the elderly. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Canada had relatively low infection prevalence and low IFRs in the community, but not in nursing homes, during the first viral wave. Self-collected DBS for antibody testing is a practicable strategy to monitor the ongoing second viral wave and, eventually, vaccine-induced immunity among Canadian adults.",2021,,,,,,PPR293015,10.1101/2021.03.04.21252540,,#88960,=Actiontobeatcoronavirus/Actionpourbattrelecoronavirus(Ab-C)StudyInvestigators 2021,"",""

Serum samples were analysed using both chemioluminescent assay (Liason SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, Diasorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and neutralising antibodies (NT-Abs) assay., RESULTS: In the period 18 Mach-24 June, 1922 BD were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 BD was tested in parallel with SARS-CoV2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2 and 21.6%, respectively. SARS-CoV2 IgG quantification was correlated with NT-Abs titres. In 78.2% subjects NT-Abs titre was maintained, while in 15.8% decreased of one four-fold dilution and in 6.0% increased of one four-fold dilution., CONCLUSIONS: The duration of immunity of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the course of pandemic and for this reason monitoring of NT Abs is important.

"Serological surveys to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults (Sero-MAss study), Massachusetts, July-August 2020: a mail-based cross-sectional study","Snyder, Teah; Ravenhurst, Johanna; Cramer, Estee; Reich, Nicholas; Balzer, Laura; Alfandari, Dominique; Lover, Andrew","<h4>Background</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. The state of Massachusetts was especially impacted during the initial stages; however, the extent of asymptomatic transmission remains poorly understood due to limited asymptomatic testing in the “first wave.” To address this gap, a geographically representative and contact-free seroprevalence survey was conducted in July-August 2020, to estimate prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections. <h4>Methods</h4> Students, faculty, librarians and staff members at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were invited to participate in this study along with one member of their household in June 2020. Two separate sampling frames were generated from administrative lists: all undergraduates and their household members (primary sampling group) were randomly selected with probability proportional to population size. All staff, faculty, graduate students and librarians (secondary sampling group) were selected as a simple random sample. After informed consent and a socio-behavioral survey, participants were mailed test kits and asked to return self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and then IgM antibodies if IgG-positive. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for survey non-response. Binomial models were used to assess factors associated with seropositivity in both sample groups separately. <h4>Results</h4> Approximately 27,000 persons were invited via email to assess eligibility. Of the 1,001 individuals invited to participate in the study, 762 (76%) returned blood samples for analysis. In the primary sampling group 548 returned samples, of which 230 enrolled a household member. Within the secondary sampling group of 214 individuals, 79 enrolled a household member. In the primary sample group, 36 (4.6%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated weighed prevalence for this population of 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.0). In the secondary sampling group, 10 (3.4%) of 292 individuals had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated adjusted prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.4). No samples were IgM positive. No association was found in either sample group between seropositivity and self-reported work duties or customer-facing hours. In the primary sampling group, self-reported febrile illness since Feb 2020, male sex, and minority race (Black or American Indian/Alaskan Native) were associated with seropositivity. No factors except geographic regions within the state were associated with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the secondary sampling group. <h4>Interpretation</h4> This study provides insight into the seroprevalence of university-related populations and their household members across the state of Massachusetts during the summer of 2020 of the pandemic and helps to fill a critical gap in estimating the levels of sub-clinical and asymptomatic infection. Estimates like these can be used to calibrate models that estimate levels of population immunity over time to inform public health interventions and policy. <h4>Funding</h4> UMass Faculty Fund (A Lover); UMass Faculty Discretionary Funds (N Reich); UMass Institute for Applied Life Science “Midigrant” (#169076; A.

A study to measure seroprevalence was conducted in July 2020 to assess the level of contamination in these neighbourhoods after the first wave of the pandemic, and to identify factors associated with seropositivity. <h4>Methods</h4> SCoPe is a cross-sectional survey conducted in selected persons aged six years old and over living in three neighbourhoods in Perpignan. Households were selected by systematic sampling and participants by random sampling. Collected blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using the EIecsys® immunoassay to target the coronavirus’s spike protein. Antibody seroprevalence was estimated from weighted data and associated factors were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. <h4>Results</h4> The seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 35.4% (95% CI: 30.2-41.0). Over a fifth of seropositive individuals (21.7% ([14.1-31.8]) did not report any COVID-19 symptom. People aged 15-64 years old were at greater risk of seropositivity than those aged 65 years or over. Obesity prevalence was 40.7% (35.8-45.8) and obese people were more likely to be seropositive (aOR=2.0 [1.1-3.8]). The risk of being seropositive was higher in households with clinical COVID-19 cases (One case: aOR=2.5 [1.3-5.0]). In the neighbourhood with the highest measured seroprevalence, people living in a dwelling with 1-2 rooms had a higher risk of being seropositive than those living in a 4-room house (aOR=2.8 [1.2-6.3]). Working during the lockdown was associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (aOR=0.2 [0.03-1.0]). <h4>Conclusion</h4> Transmission prevalence of the SARS-COV-2 virus in this vulnerable population was very high during the COVID-19 pandemic’s first wave.

Fortunately, most infected individuals recover and are then resistant to re-infection for a period, indicating that a vaccination approach can be successful. Elucidation of rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within select regions across the United States of America (USA) will help direct vaccination efforts and together will inform our approach towards achieving herd immunity. Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August to December 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days of this time frame, versus a significant increase to 9.24% in the last 58 days, and a final rate of 12.86% in December 2020. Approximately 56% of Spike seropositive individuals also had immunoreactivity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the Spike protein, which is associated with viral neutralization. Males and females in the Cincinnati area showed nearly identical rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians were not significantly different. Interestingly, donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed that the West side of Cincinnati had a rate of 9.63% versus 8.13% on the East side (demarcated by Interstate-75), while the adjoining area of Kentucky was 7.04% (as demarcated by the Ohio River).

Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the prevention of disease among this population. Methods: We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French university hospital after the first wave (May-June 2020), based on a validated lateral flow immuno-assay test (LFIAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics as well as data on the working characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and 23 care activities were systematically recorded. The effectiveness of protective equipment was also estimated, based on self-declaration of mask use. SARS-CoV-2 IgG status was modelled by multiple imputations approach, accounting for the performance of the test and data on serum validation ELISA immunoassay. Findings: Among the 3,234 enrolled HCWs, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Contact with relatives or HCWs who developed COVID-19 were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during naso-pharyngeal sampling, patient mobilisation, clinical and eye examination was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without self-declared appropriate use of protective equipment. Interpretation: Main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs were i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures.

A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 +/- 11 years) in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our hospital in late May, 2020.

We quantified IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain and estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model accounting for test performance. <h4>Results:</h4> We recruited 2,214 participants from August 10 to September 11, 2020 and 22.3% had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers above levels in pre-pandemic samples. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.5% (32.1 - 46.8) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case, 104 (87-126) infections were unreported.

In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether healthcare workers with high exposure to Covid-19 patients had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than other healthcare workers in a Norwegian University Hospital. We also investigated the prevalence of asymptomatic healthcare workers in a ward with a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak., METHODS: Healthcare workers from five wards at Akershus University Hospital were included between May 11 and June 11, 2020. Blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and seroprevalences compared between participants with high and low exposure to Covid-19 patients. Demographic data and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors were recorded in a questionnaire. Naso-/oropharyngeal swabs from participants from the outbreak ward were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: 360/436 (82.6%) healthcare workers participated. 9/262 (3.4%) participants from wards with high exposure to Covid-19 patients were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive versus 3/98 (3.1%) from wards with low exposure (OR 1.13; 95%CI 0.3-4.26, p = .861).

Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab test performed for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (primary study). Additionally, they were invited to complete a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19 individuals and their COVID-19-related symptoms (secondary study). Prevalence of antibodies (IgG, IgM or both) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated., RESULTS: Seventy nine percent of the hospital's HCWs (N = 2210) took part in the primary study. Antibodies were detected in 61 participants, a prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5-3.1). The prevalence was slightly higher in nurses (3.4%), registrars (3.9%), and wardens (3.4%).

We used the Siemens spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody assay to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and then estimated seroprevalence for the US dialysis and adult population by standardizing by age, sex and region. We also compared January 2021 seroprevalence and case-detection rates to that from a similar subsample of patients receiving dialysis who had been tested in July 2020. <h4>Results</h4> Patients in the sample were disproportionately from older age and minority race/ethnic groups. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 18.9% (95% CI: 18.3-19.5%) in the sample, 18.7% (18.1-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (20.3-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population (range 15.3-20.8% in the Northeast and South respectively). Younger age groups (18-44 years), and persons self-identifying as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living in the poorest neighborhoods were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence (25.9% (24.1-27.8%), 25.1% (23.6-26.4%), 24.8% (23.2-26.5%) respectively). Compared to data from July 2020, we observed diminished variability in seroprevalence by geographic region and urban-rural status. Estimated case detection rate increased from 14% to 23% in July 2020 to January 2021. <h4>Conclusions</h4> A year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US, fewer than one in four adults have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

We aimed to determine whether prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied between six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods Participants aged 25-79 years enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort were randomly selected within ethnic groups and invited to test for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answer COVID-19 related questions. We estimated prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within ethnic groups using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar time. Results Between June 24-October 9, 2020, we included 2497 participants.

Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 exposure varied across ethnic groups, while the most common determinant was having a household member suspected of infection. In Ghanaians, seropositivity was associated with older age, larger household sizes, living with small children, leaving home to work and attending religious services.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in health care and hospital workers (HCHWs) and assess how antibody levels change over time. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional study of employed HCHWs at a freestanding, urban pediatric tertiary care hospital. Employed HCHWs $18 years old who were asymptomatic and worked in clinical hospital locations were eligible to participate. Participants completed blood draws and surveys at baseline (between May 4, 2020, and June 2, 2020) and 2 months later (between July 6, 2020, and August 7, 2020). Surveys collected demographic information, SARS-CoV-2 exposures, and previous COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULT(S): In total, 530 participants enrolled in and completed baseline study activities. The median age was 37 years (range 19-67 years); 86% identified as female, and 80% identified as white. Two months later, 481 (91%) HCHWs completed another survey and blood draw. Four of 5 (0.9%) seropositive subjects at baseline remained seropositive at 2 months, although 3 had decreasing IgG indices.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large prospective cohort study of elite football players in Germany (May-June 2020): implications for a testing protocol in asymptomatic individuals and estimation of the rate of undetected cases,Mack D.; Gartner B.C.; Rossler A.; Kimpel J.; Donde K.; Harzer O.; Krutsch W.; von Laer D.; Meyer T. ,"Objectives: Elite professional football players and staff are a unique group that might give insight into the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Germany and thus can serve as a model for geographical distribution and an estimation of undetected infections. Method(s): In this prospective cohort study seroprevalence was determined twice in May and June 2020 in players and staff from the German Bundesliga. As screening assays, a commercial ELISA (Euroimmun) and a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (Roche) were used, and an in-house neutralization assay (NT) was used as reference standard. Participants were tested twice weekly using PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs. Result(s): Seroprevalence (NT used as confirmation) in 2164 samples from 1184 players and staff was rather similar in May (23/1157, 1.99%) and June (21/1007, 2.09%). All participants were PCR-negative during the study period. Significant regional differences in seroprevalence were not observed. When comparing seroprevalence with the cumulative incidence of infections derived from the German notification system (subgroup matching to cohort; men, age 20-69 years), IgG was found eight to ten times more frequently, pointing to a high rate of undetected infection. ELISA and CLIA correlated only moderately (kappa 0.52). Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence with a high-quality diagnostic in Germany seemed to be around 2%. The number of undetected infections seems to be eight to ten times higher than in notification data. The quality of antibody assays is rather variable, thus results should ideally be confirmed at least by a second assay to prove IgG positivity.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",2021,/,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,27,3,473,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.11.033,2010459430,#87270,Mack 2021,"",""

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19. Method(s): Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics. Result(s): Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusion(s): In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.Copyright © 2020, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.",2021,/,Public Health Reports,136,1,88-96,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033354920966064,2007102999,#86819,McPherson 2021,"",""

In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Patients and Methods: From April 1st, 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of Covid-19, were evaluated and tested for SARSCoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARSCoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARSCoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference between mildly symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (38 vs. 17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6 vs. 10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARSCoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic Covid-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARSCoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.",2020,/,Tumori,106,2 SUPPL,74-75,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300891620953388,634192488,#84848,Zambelli 2020,"",""

Main Method(s): Pregnant women admitted for labor and delivery at two Spanish hospitals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test and by detection of serum immunoglobulins G and M. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared in women with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with those with negative tests. Key Findings: Between March 31st and September 30th, 2020, 1211 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 5.4% (n = 65), corresponding to (i) 22 ongoing infections at admission, including two with mild clinical symptoms and 20 asymptomatic women; (ii) 43 cases of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure; (iii) and 1146 women who were negative for both SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serological test. None of the screened mothers required hospital admission for coronavirus disease before or after delivery, nor were any of the newborns admitted to the intensive care unit. All newborns from mothers with positive PCR on admission were PCR negative. There were no significant differences in maternal or perinatal outcomes among the three studied groups.

Laboratory correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the U.S,Anand S.; Montez-Rath M.; Han J.; Bozeman J.; Kerschmann R.; Parsonnet J.; Chertow G. ,"Background: We investigated the association of laboratory surrogates of health status with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in patients on dialysis. Aim of the study Recognize the association of routinely collected laboratory tests with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody Methods: We used data from July 2020 on SARS-CoV-2 total antibody seropositivity from a nationwide sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis (n = 2292, 8% seropositive). In separate logistic regression models accounting for age, sex, region, zip code tabulation area race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000, we modeled the odds of seropositivity for seven laboratory covariates compared with a reference value. For serum albumin, we additionally evaluated its distribution by seropositive status in the antecedent six months. Result(s): Odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were higher among patients with albumin <4 g/dL, creatinine <12.5 mg/ dL, and hemoglobin <10 g/dL. Similar trends emerged for sodium, potassium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone. Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL. Serum albumin concentrations were identical in January and February among patients with and without seropositivity in July, but dropped starting in March among patients with seropositivity, with peak difference observed in May (median 3.6 (25th, 75th percentile 3.3, 3.9) versus 3.8 (3.5, 4.0)) g/dL in seropositive and seronegative groups, p value<0.0001). Conclusion(s): Laboratory values associated with poorer health status and higher risk for mortality were also associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis.

Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence using multiple serology platforms,"Carreno, Juan Manuel; Mendu, Damodara Rao; Simon, Viviana; Shariff, Masood; Singh, Gagandeep; Menon, Vidya; Krammer, Florian","Serological tests are important tools helping to determine previous infection with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to monitor immune responses. The current tests are based on spike (S), the receptor binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrate. Here, we used samples from a high seroprevalence cohort of health care workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using three distinct serological assays. 501 serum samples were tested using: a) a research-grade RBD and spike based tandem enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MS-RBD ELISA, MS-spike ELISA), b) a commercial RBD and spike based tandem ELISA (Kantaro-RBD, -spike), and c) a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Abbott Architect). Seroprevalence ranged around 28% during the early stage of the pandemic (a: 28.4% positives; b: 28.1%; c: 27.3%). Good correlation was observed between the MS and Kantaro RBD ELISAs and between the MS and Kantaro spike ELISAs. By contrast, modest correlations were observed between the Abbott Architect and both RBD and spike-based assays. A proportion of HCWs (n=178) were sampled again 3-5 months after the first time point. Although antibody levels declined in most of the positive individuals, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD-spike based assays remained unchanged. However the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Lastly, we tested six samples of individuals who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and found that seroconversion was detected by the RBD-spike assays but, of course as expected, not the NP based assay. In summary, our results consolidate the strength of different serological assays to assess the magnitude and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.",2021,,,,,,PPR289378,10.1101/2021.02.24.21252340,,#85228,Carreno 2021,"",""

This observational study depicts SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and serological curves among first-line healthcare workers (HCWs) at Padua University Hospital (PdUH), North-East Italy. <h4>Method</h4> 344 HCWs, working at the PdUH Emergency Department and Infectious Disease Unit, underwent a SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab with paired IgM and IgG antibody detection for 4 consecutive weeks. At every session, a questionnaire recorded symptoms, signs and recent contacts with SARS-CoV-2 patients. Positive cases were followed up for 5 months. <h4>Results</h4> Twenty-seven HCWs (7.84%) had positive serology (Abs) with 12 positive swabs during the study period. Two additional HCWs were positive by swab but without Abs. Fourteen cases (4%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection before the beginning of the study. An HCW with autoimmune disease showed false Ab results. 46% of individuals with Abs reported no symptoms, in accordance with previous population studies. Fever, nasal congestion, diarrhoea and contacts with SARS-CoV-2 individuals correlated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 96% of Abs+ cases showed persistent positive antibodies 5 months later and none was re-infected. <h4>Discussion</h4> Correct use of PPEs and separate paths for positive/negative patients in the hospital can result in a low percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs, even in high risk settings. Frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs is worthwhile, irrespective of HCWs’ symptoms, due to the lack of specificity together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases. Further studies are needed to elucidate the neutralizing effect of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",2021,,,,,,PPR287888,10.1101/2021.02.23.21249481,,#85187,Barbaro 2021,"",""

This is the case of the HCV infection that, in Italy, had recently seen important milestones towards its elimination which, now, risk being nullified. On the other hand, one of the biggest questions regarding the epidemiology of COVID-19 is the real burden of the asymptomatic carriers. It would be very useful to associate the screening for both the diseases, in order to effectively respond to two important clinical needs. Method(s): A prospective observational cohort study was set-up in an urban area of the Naples province, in which a contemporary screening for HCVAb and for SARS-Cov-2 IgG/IgM rapid blood tests was performed. All the positive patients underwent RT-PCR for HCVRNA and/or SARS-Cov-2-RNA. The study was approved by our Ethical Committee. Result(s): Of the 3845 people who live and work in the chosen area, 3556 were eligible for the screening and, of these, 2740 (77.05%) participated voluntarily from June 25 to July 12, 2020. Of them, 39 patients(1.4%) resulted SARS-Cov2-IgM- or -IgG-positive. None of these resulted subsequently positive for SARS-Cov2-RNA. Forty-one patients were HCVAb-positive(1.5%) and, of them, 5(0.18%) resulted HCVRNA-positive. Of those HCVAb positive, 36/41(87.8%) reported awareness of their positivity and, in 88.8% of cases(32/36), had already been subjected to antiviral therapy with a 96.87%(31/32)SVR. Of the other 4 patients aware of their positivity, 2(50%) were HCVRNA-positive. Of the remaining 5 HCVAb-positive patients, that were unaware of their positivity, 2 were HCVRNA-positive. Of notice, HCVAb-positivity was detected in patients of >41 years with 82.0%(32/39) in the 61-80 years age-class. Conclusion(s): The screening of an entire cohort of an urban area of Southern Italy showed a seroprevalence of anti-SARS-Cov2-Ab and HCV-Ab of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, whereas only 0.18% had an active HCV infection.

We age-sex-standardized our seroprevalence rates using census population projections and adjusted for laboratory assay performance. Confidence intervals were generated with a two-stage bootstrap. We used Bayesian modeling to test whether seroprevalence changes over time were statistically significant., RESULTS: Seroprevalence remained below 10% at all sites except New York and Florida, where it reached 23.2% and 13.3%, respectively. Statistically significant increases in seroprevalence followed peaks in reported cases in New York, South Florida, Utah, Missouri and Louisiana. In the absence of such peaks, some significant decreases were observed over time in New York, Missouri, Utah, and Western Washington. The estimated cumulative number of infections with detectable antibody response continued to exceed reported cases in all sites., CONCLUSIONS: Estimated seroprevalence was low in most sites, indicating that most people in the U.S. have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of July 2020. The majority of infections are likely not reported. Decreases in seroprevalence may be related to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, or evidence of waning of detectable anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody levels at the population level. Thus, seroprevalence estimates may underestimate the cumulative incidence of infection. Copyright Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2021.

Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India., Methods: : The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies., Results: : Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Portugal in May-July 2020: Results of the First National Serological Survey (ISNCOVID-19).,"Kislaya, Irina; Goncalves, Paulo; Barreto, Marta; Sousa, Rita; Garcia, Ana Cristina; Matos, Rita; Guiomar, Raquel; Rodrigues, Ana Paula; ISNCOVID-19 Group","INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to estimate and describe the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies (immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G) in Portugal in May-July 2020., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey was developed after the peak of the first epidemic wave on a sample of 2301 Portuguese residents, aged 1 year or older. Survey sample was selected using a two-stage stratified non-probability sampling design (quota sampling). SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence estimates of immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G and 95% confidence intervals were stratified by sex, age group, health region and education., RESULTS: Overall, seroprevalence was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.0% - 4.2%). Higher prevalence rates were observed in male (4.1%, 95% confidence interval: 2.6% - 6.6%) and those with secondary education (6.4%, 95% confidence interval: 3.2% - 12.5%). Differences in seroprevalence by age group and region were not statistically significant., DISCUSSION: The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the cumulative incidence reported by the National Surveillance System but far from necessary to reach herd immunity., CONCLUSION: Our results support limited extent of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the study population possibly due to early lockdown measures implemented in Portugal and support the need to continue monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in order to increase our knowledge about the evolution of the epidemic and to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population over time.",2021,/,Acta medica portuguesa,34,2,87-94,,https://dx.doi.org/10.20344/amp.15122,33641702,#82863,Kislaya 2021,"",""

Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was performed. SARS-CoV-2 viral reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record. Data were analyzed using univariate statistical methods with clustering for multiple births., RESULTS: In total, 1,000 patients delivered between May 1 and September 22, 2020. Fifty-eight (5.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. Twenty-three also tested viral positive during pregnancy. Three of 1,000 (0.3%) were viral positive on admission but antibody negative. The median age was 30 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 26-33 years) and body mass index was 31.75 kg/m2 (IQR 27.7-37.5 kg/m2). The cesarean delivery rate was 34.0%. The study population was primarily white (71.6%); however, 41.0% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients identified as Black, 18.0% as Hispanic/Latino, 3.3% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and only 27.9% as White (p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 infection was more likely in patients without private insurance (p = 0.0243). Adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes were not more likely in patients with evidence of infection during pregnancy. Two SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. There were no maternal deaths during the study period., CONCLUSION: In this largely rural Midwest population, 6.1% of delivering patients had evidence of past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rates of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy were higher among racial and ethnic minorities and patients without private insurance. The SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and their neonates were not found to be at increased risk for adverse outcomes., KEY POINTS: .

Design(s): Retrospective analysis of SNF electronic health records. Setting(s): Qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results were available from 81 SNFs in 16 states. Participant(s): Six hundred and sixty nine SNF residents who underwent both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following the first positive PCR test for confirmed cases, or first PCR test for non-cases. Result(s): Among 397 residents with PCR-confirmed infection, antibodies were detected in 4 of 7 (57.1%) tested within 7-14 days of their first positive PCR test; in 44 of 47 (93.6%) tested within 15-30 days; in 182 of 219 (83.1%) tested within 31-60 days; and in 110 of 124 (88.7%) tested after 60 days. Among 272 PCR negative residents, antibodies were detected in 2 of 9 (22.2%) tested within 7-14 days of their first PCR test; in 41 of 81 (50.6%) tested within 15-30 days; in 65 of 148 (43.9%) tested within 31-60 days; and in 9 of 34 (26.5%) tested after 60 days. No significant differences in baseline resident characteristics or symptoms were observed between those with versus without antibodies. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that vulnerable older adults can mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, and that antibodies are most likely to be detected within 15-30 days of diagnosis. That antibodies were detected in a large proportion of residents with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the complexity of identifying who is infected in real time.

To this end a specific response plan, integrating recommendations from relevant networks (AIOM, NCCN, ISS, ANIPIO, FNOPI), was implemented to minimize exposure risks and fatality rates for patients (pts.) and personnel. Method(s): From March 10, triage checkpoints at hospital main entrances were activated to regulate access to wards, outpts. chemotherapy facility and diagnostics units (A). From April, additional stations were established at further building allocating outpts. clinics and surgical day care (B). Nursing staff was involved in several intervention domains: 1. development and updating of triage forms for pts. and caregivers (10 updates). 2. Education and guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE). 3. regulation of inflow at triage stations. This was achieved through a specific protocol including support for access forms compilation, collection of travel/contact history, thermoscan survey, monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation for unfit patients, direct interaction with referral physicians through point-of-care (POC) audits to secure access for symptomatic patients and 'suspect COVID-19 cases' in need of non-deferrable treatments. These POC audits were mainly aimed at separating cancer and treatment-symptoms from indicators of possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4. Nasopharyngeal swabbing for personnel and 'suspect cases' at POC and within a precautionary program for all immunocompromised petients accessing the hematology-oncology Unit. 5. From May 15, setup and administration of rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM with POC nasopharyngeal swabbing for those displaying positive antibody results. 6.

High seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India; What does it tell us about managing a pandemic and beyond?,George C.E.; Inbaraj L.R.; Chandrasingh S.; De Witte L.P. ,"People living in urban slums or informal settlements are among the most vulnerable communities, highly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and vulnerable to the consequences of the measures taken to control the spread of the virus. Fear and stigma related to infection, mistrust between officials and the population, the often-Asymptomatic nature of the disease is likely to lead to under-reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India 3 months after the index case and recruited 499 adults (age >18 years). The majority (74.3%) were females and about one-Third of the population reported comorbidities. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibody for COVID-19 was 57.9% (95% CI 53.4-62.3). Age, education, occupation and the presence of reported comorbidities were not associated with seroprevalence (P-value >0.05). Case-To-undetected-infections ratio was 1:195 and infection fatality rate was calculated as 2.94 per 10 000 infections. We estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 was very high in our study population. The focus in this slum should shift from infection prevention to managing the indirect consequences of the pandemic. We recommend seroprevalence studies in such settings before vaccination to identify the vulnerability of COVID-19 infection to optimise the use of insufficient resources. It is a wake-up call to societies and nations, to dedicate paramount attention to slums into recovery and beyond-to build, restore and maintain health equity for the 'Health and wellbeing of all'.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods We cloned and purified the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV and examined their immunogenicity with serum from patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. An ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein for IgG detection was tested with serum from 149 healthy blood donors who donated 3 years previously and with serum positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV (by indirect immunofluorescence assay) from 106 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was studied with the ELISA in healthy blood donors who donated during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, non-pneumonic hospital inpatients, and symptom-free health-care workers. All positive samples were confirmed by two separate western-blot assays (with recombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike polypeptide). Findings Western-blot analysis showed that the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic.

Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 platform (SeeGene Inc.,Rep. of Korea) or the GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2 platform (Cepheid, USA). Intravenous blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories). <h4>Setting:</h4> Academic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Participants: We invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study. Main Outcome Measures: The CAST study aimed to examine the infection rate and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current accepted gold standard platform in Ireland. <h4>Results:</h4> By July 2020, 398 tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, indicating a positive diagnosis for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The CAST study enrolled 137 HCW, with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 45/86 (52%) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 44/45 (98%) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 2/51 control participants (4%), with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (4/51). We demonstrate that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results.

We determined the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all health care workers (HCW) at a hospital. Method(s): Cross-sectional study (14-27/04/2020). We determined SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in all HCW including external workers of a teaching hospital in Madrid. They were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Result(s): Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (88,7%) were evaluated. The mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1), and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Of these, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high- (33.1%) and medium- (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p = 0.007), but not for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p > 0.05). HWC with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR-positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis seropositivity was significantly associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), nurse assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27).

We studied Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-antibody seroprevalence in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County., METHODS: On 3 and 4 April 2020, we tested 3328 county residents for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a rapid lateral-flow assay (Premier Biotech). Participants were recruited using advertisements that were targeted to reach county residents that matched the county population by gender, race/ethnicity and zip code of residence. We estimate weights to match our sample to the county by zip, age, sex and race/ethnicity. We report the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We adjust for test-performance characteristics by combining data from 18 independent test-kit assessments: 14 for specificity and 4 for sensitivity., RESULTS: The raw prevalence of antibodies in our sample was 1.5% [exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.0%]. Test-performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95% CI 99.2-99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95% CI 76.0-88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test-performance characteristics was 1.2% (95% CI 0.7-1.8%). After weighting for population demographics, the prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 1.3-4.2%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 53 000 [95% CI 26 000 to 82 000 using weighted prevalence; 23 000 (95% CI 14 000-35 000) using unweighted prevalence] people were infected in Santa Clara County by late March-many more than the ~1200 confirmed cases at the time., CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that COVID-19 was likely more widespread than indicated by the number of cases in late March, 2020. At the time, low-burden contexts such as Santa Clara County were far from herd-immunity thresholds. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known., METHODS: We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population., RESULTS: Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls., CONCLUSIONS: There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status.

Interpretation of serological results in with respect to international reference material can inform this essential question. Methods 1,507 West Midlands dental care professionals were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was determined and the cohort was followed longitudinally for 6 months until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and commencement of vaccination. Results Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3% in this cohort, compared to estimates in the general population of between 6-7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3 and 6-month follow up and conferred a 74% reduced risk of infection. During follow-up, no PCR-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. Post-vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in individuals with who were seropositive at baseline. Conclusion Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 months after initial sampling and 9 months from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.

The surveillance of seropositive individuals serves as an indicator to the extent of infection spread and provides an estimation of herd immunity status among population. Reports from different countries investigated this issue among healthcare workers (HCWs) who are ""at risk"" and ""sources of risk"" for COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in one of the COVID-19 referral centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia using three different serological methods., Methods: In-house developed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), commercially available electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and microneutralization (MN) assay were utilized to determine the seroprevalence rate among the study population. 204 HCWs participated in the study. Both physicians and nurses working in the COVID-19 and non COVID-19 areas were included. Twelve out of 204 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with variable disease severity. Samples from recovered HCWs were collected four weeks post diagnosis., Results: The overall seroprevalence rate was 6.3% (13 out of 204) using the in-house ELISA and MN assay and it was 5.8% (12 out of 204) using the commercial ECLIA. Among HCWs undiagnosed with COVID-19, the seroprevalence was 2% (4 out 192). Notably, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in 3 (25%) out 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19., Conclusions: Our study, similar to the recent national multi-center study, showed a low seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies among HCWs. Concordance of results between the commercial electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), in-house ELISA and MN assay was observed. The in-house ELISA is a promising tool for the serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, seroprevalence studies may underestimate the extent of COVID-19 infection as some cases with mild disease did not have detectable antibody responses.

Health care workers (HCW) may be at higher risk of contracting the disease within the working environment and therefore the seroprevalence in this population is of particular interest. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in Vorarlberg HCW in a prospective cohort study. Methods A total of 395 HCW have been tested at three different time points for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for NP and RBD. Enrollment started in June 2020 (t1), two months after the end of the first wave. Re-testing took place between October to November at the beginning of the second wave (t2), and again at the end of the second wave in January 2021 (t3). Results At t1, 3% of HCW showed a strong IgG-specific responses to either NP or RBD. At t2, the rate increased to 4%, and after the second wave in January 2021, 14% had a strong response, which was assessed to be stable for up to ten months. The amount of HCW with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 38% higher than the number of infections found by RT-PCR. Conclusion We found low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a hotspot setting after the first wave but a very high increase during the second massive wave.

Nationwide seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic population in South Korea: a cross-sectional study.,"Nah, Eun-Hee; Cho, Seon; Park, Hyeran; Hwang, Inhwan; Cho, Han-Ik","OBJECTIVE: Asymptomatic active infection might be an important contributor to the COVID-19 outbreak. Serological tests can assess the extent of exposure and herd immunity to COVID-19 in general populations. This study aimed to estimate the nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, sex and clinical status in South Korea., DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany)., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39% (95% CI=0.20% to 0.58%): 0.30% (95% CI=0.06% to 0.54%) for men and 0.48% (95% CI=0.18% to 0.78%) for women. The rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity varied significantly between different regions of Korea (p=0.003), but not with age group, sex, or the statuses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension or smoking., CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Korean population is still immunologically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but the seroprevalence has increased relative to that found in studies performed prior to September 2020 in Korea.

The health department of the fourth largest city in the U.S. recognized that sound estimates of viral impact were needed to inform decision-making., METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases., RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was higher than previously reported and is greater than that estimated from RT-PCR data.

However, the number of cases is vastly underreported using these methods. Seroprevalence studies estimate cumulative infection incidences and allow monitoring of transmission dynamics, and the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the population.

Sampling was carried out weekly and began 17 days before Mexico's first officially confirmed case. The 24,273 sera obtained were analyzed by chemiluminescent-linked immunosorbent assay (CLIA) IgG S1/S2 and, later, positive cases using this technique were also analyzed to determine the rate of neutralization using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We identified 40 CLIA IgG positive cases before the first official report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico. The national seroprevalence was 3.5% in February and 33.5% in December.

A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 7 and November 30, 2020, in a multi-specialty hospital in Eastern India designated as COVID hospital during this pandemic. Study participants included 2,110 HCWs, including those who have recovered from COVID infection., METHOD: HCWs were required to complete a questionnaire and give written consent to participate in the study. Their venous blood sample was collected for serum analysis of IgG antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by chemiluminescent immunoassay., RESULTS: Positive IgG antibodies were seen in 924 participants with a point prevalence of 43.79%. Slightly higher reactivity was seen in males. History of COVID-19 infection was noted in 10.9%, with the highest antibody response in 81% cases. A maximum of 87.9% reactivity was seen in the first two months, and a significant fall was noted in the fourth month, with reactivity seen in only 50% of the study participants., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a variable immune response in the infected population.

Unexpected False-Positive Rates in Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 Serology Using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG Assay.,"Geisler, Daniel; Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J; Wheeler, Sarah E","OBJECTIVES: Serologic assay performance studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) in pediatric populations are lacking, and few seroprevalence studies have routinely incorporated orthogonal testing to improve accuracy., METHODS: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays., RESULTS: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance., CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children.

Understanding the trends in COVID-19 positivity rates over time is crucial in planning and mitigation of the virus. This current study analyzes the trends in COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 antigen and antibody positivity rates over a 3-month time-span from October to December 2020. A retrospective study was conducted collecting data from a mobile testing program during October to December 2020 in the Phoenix metropolitan area. COVID-19 antigen and antibody positivity rates were analyzed. A total of 6710 patients were included in the study. As the months progressed, more patients were tested (October: 1635; November: 2037; December: 3038). The COVID-19 antigen positivity rate was significantly higher in December, compared to October and November (13.43% vs. 11.43 and 10.86%, p = 0.021). COVID-19 IgG rates were also significantly higher in November and December, compared to October (16.65 and 16.50% vs. 8.74%, p < 0.001).

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody in Echocardiography and Stress Laboratory.,"Jain, Renuka; Kroboth, Stacie; Ignatowski, Denise; Khandheria, Bijoy K","Purpose: Transesophageal echocardiography is an aerosol-generating procedure, and exercise stress testing is a potentially aerosol-generating activity. Concern has been raised about heightened risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among health care personnel participating in these procedures. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in echocardiography and stress laboratory staff., Methods: All staff who worked in the echocardiography and stress laboratories of one high-traffic urban hospital from March 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, were asked to voluntarily participate. Those willing to participate were consented, and past COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test (ARCHITECT, Abbott Laboratories) from June 15, 2020, to July 3, 2020. Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record, and self-reported symptoms were documented with a participant survey., Results: A total of 43 staff members (86.0% of 50 total laboratory staff) participated. A majority of participants were less than 40 years old (69.8%), were White (86.0%), and were women (79.1%); mean body mass index was 24.9 +/- 4.7 kg/m2. Of the 43 staff members tested for past COVID-19 infection, 3 (7.0%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody result. There were no unique features in the 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects; of these, 2 had known prior COVID-19 infection and 1 was asymptomatic., Conclusions: This study provides clinical data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in echocardiography and stress laboratory staff who regularly participate in a variety of procedures that are or may be aerosol-generating.

Preventive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries. This study contributes to future decision making by understanding population immunity against SARS-CoV2 and its relation to living conditions and foccus that comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions are needed.",2021,/,Medicina,81,2,135-142,,,33906129,#103220,Figar 2021,"",""
"EXPRESS: Comparison of four high throughput, automated immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Oakey, Jane; Haslam, Shonagh; Brown, Andrew Peter; Eglin, Janet; Houghton, Brittany; Singleton, Dawn","BACKGROUND: A number of immunoassays have been developed to measure antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. More data is required on their comparability, particularly amongst those with milder infections and in the general practice population. The aim of this study was to compare four high throughput automated anti SARS-CoV-2 assays using samples collected from hospitalised patients and healthcare workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we collected general practice samples to compare antibody results and determine seroprevalence., METHODS: Samples were collected from 57 hospitalised patients and 9 healthcare workers at 14 days and at 28 days following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were also collected from 225 patients presenting to general practice. Four assays were used: Abbott Architect IgG, Beckman Coulter DxI 800 IgG, Roche Cobas e801 total antibody and Siemens Advia Centaur XPT total antibody., RESULTS: All 4 assays showed concordance at 14 days in 83.9% of hospitalised patients and in 66.7% of healthcare workers. All 4 assays showed concordance at 28 days in 88.4% of hospitalised patients and 77.8% of healthcare workers. The sensitivity to detect recent infection was higher for the IgG assays than the total assays. All 4 assays showed concordance of 95.1% in the general practice population. Seroprevalence ranged from 4.9-5.8% depending on the assay used., CONCLUSIONS: All 4 assays showed excellent comparability but it may be possible to obtain a negative result for any of the anti SARS-CoV-2 assays in patients with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and FDA authorized for emergency, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this ""first wave"" and suggest that the notion of ""herd immunity"" at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.",2021,/,PloS one,16,4,e0250319,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250319,33909646,#103636,Jin 2021,"",""

Japan is known to have relatively smaller number of its infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection., Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by the decade of age and sex., Results: There were 33 positive IgG among 1000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (population: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934-69,868).

Seroprevalence surveys are an important tool to identify not just cases that have come to clinical attention, but all previously infected recipients. We performed a seroprevalence survey of the adult heart transplant program at a large New York City Hospital System. 232 (87% of recipients being followed) subjects were tested, of whom 37 (15.9%) were found to be previously infected. This is comparable to the overall rate of prior infection in the NYC metro area. Disease course tended to be more severe than in the general population; however, this was at least partially driven by traditional risk factors of age and comorbidities. Lastly, 9 of 10 recipients who were initially found to be PCR positive subsequently tested positive for antibodies, confirming the ability of this population to mount a humoral response. In conclusion, prevalence of COVID 19 in heart transplant recipients on immunosuppression was comparable to that in the general population of NYC, and 90% of those with an initially positive viral swab developed antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 Ig G among Healthcare Workers and the General Population.,"Milani, Gregorio P; Bianchetti, Mario G; Togni, Giuseppe; Schoenenberger, Andreas W; Muggli, Franco","It is assumed that healthcare workers are at the highest risk to be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, few data from healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection support this assumption. We investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (Ig G) against SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the general population in a well-defined geographical area. The first part of the study was conducted in May 2020 in Val Mesolcina (Southern Switzerland), a valley with ~8000 inhabitants. All healthcare workers were invited. All participants (n = 488) of the Swiss Longitudinal Cohort Study (SWICOS), a cohort representative of the general population, were also invited. Circulating Ig G against spike protein subunit 1 of SARS-CoV-2 were tested in each subject. Subjects with positive Ig G were tested again after 6 months. The condition of being a healthcare worker, rather than a part of the general population, was tested as a predictor of seroprevalence positivity by both simple and multiple (adjusted for age and sex) logistic regression. Eleven (2.6%) of the 423 SWICOS participants and 46 (16%) out of 289 healthcare workers were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Phase I screening (August 2020) covered a total of 1305 individuals screened at major markets/lorry stations, major shopping malls, hospitals and research institutions involved in COVID–19 work. The screening was performed using a strip–in–cassette lateral flow type Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit that simultaneously and separately detected IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS–CoV–2 nucleocapsid protein. In Phase I, 252/1305 (19%) tested positive for IgM or IgG or both. Exposure rate was significantly higher among individuals tested at markets/lorry stations (26.9%) compared to those at Shopping Malls (9.4%). The 41—60–years age group had the highest exposure rate (27.2%). People with only a basic level or no formal education had a higher exposure rate (26.2%) than those with tertiary level education (13.1%); and higher in informally employed workers (24.0%) than those in the formal sector (15.0%). Phases II and III screening activities in October and December 2020, respectively, showed no evidence of increased seroprevalence, indicating either a reduced transmission rate or loss of antibody expression in a subset of the participants. The Upper East region has the lowest exposure rate, with only 4 of 200 participants (2%) seropositivity. Phase IV screening in February 2021 showed that exposure rates in the upper income earners (26.2%) had almost doubled since August 2020, reflective of Ghana′s second wave of symptomatic COVID–19 cases, which began in December 2020. The Phase IV results suggest that seroprevalence levels have become so high that the initial socioeconomic stratification of exposure has been lost. Overall, the data indicates a much higher COVID–19 seroprevalence in the Greater Accra Region than was officially acknowledged, likely implying a considerably lower case fatality rate than the current national figure of 0.84%.

We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody conversion by high-throughput Luminex assays in saliva samples collected weekly in 1,509 children and 396 adults in 22 Summer schools and 2 pre-schools in 27 venues in Barcelona, Spain, from June 29 th to July 31 st 2020, between the first and second COVID-19 pandemic waves. Saliva antibody conversion defined as ≥4-fold increase in IgM, IgA and/or IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens between two visits over a 5-week period was 3.22% (49/1518), or 2.36% if accounting for potentially cross-reactive antibodies, six times higher than the cumulative infection rate (0.53%) by weekly saliva RT-PCR screening. IgG conversion was higher in adults (2.94%, 11/374) than children (1.31%, 15/1144) (p=0.035), IgG and IgA levels moderately increased with age, and antibodies were higher in females. Most antibody converters increased both IgG and IgA antibodies but some augmented either IgG or IgA, with a faster decay over time for IgA than IgG. Nucleocapsid rather than spike was the main antigen target. Anti-spike antibodies were significantly higher in individuals not reporting symptoms than symptomatic individuals, suggesting a protective role against COVID-19. To conclude, saliva antibody profiling including three isotypes and multiplexing antigens is a useful and more user-friendly tool for screening pediatric populations to determine SARS-CoV-2 exposure and guide public health policies during pandemics.",2021,,,,,,PPR315434,10.1101/2021.04.20.440593,,#102971,Dobano 2021,Sara Perlman-Arrow (2021-05-10 23:58:33)(Select): Antibodies measured from saliva and not blood - does this meet our criteria?; ,""
Screening and Confirmatory Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Comparison of Health and Non-Health Workers in a Nationwide Healthcare Organization in Central Europe.,"Bartko, Johann; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Stiasny, Karin; Schloegl, Andrea; Forjan, Ernst; Zwettler, Elisabeth; Krauter, Andreas; Keil, Felix; Sedille-Mostafaie, Nazanin","Despite being located close to the European epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Austria has managed to control the first wave. In Austria, the largest health insurance fund covers 7 million people and has 12,000 employees, including 3700 healthcare workers (HCW). For patient and staff safety, transmission control measures were implemented and mass testing of employees for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted. An IgG SARS-CoV-2 rapid test on fingerstick blood was used as a screening test (ST), followed by serologic studies with 3 different immunoassays and confirmatory testing by a neutralization test (NT). Among 7858 employees, 144 had a positive ST and 88 were confirmed by a NT (1.12%, CI: 0.9-1.38%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the ST was 69.3% (CI: 60.5-77.2). Interestingly, 40% of the NT positive serum samples were tested negative in all 3 immunoassays. Of the total sample, 2242 HCW (28.5%) were identified. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in the prevalence of NT positives in HCW compared to non-HCW (23/2242 vs. 65/5301, p = 0.53). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was not increased among HCW.

Serosurveys are essential to understanding the extent of virus transmission. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi., METHODS: Between 19 July and 14 August 2020, 4487 households were selected using a random sample stratified by region and citizenship of the head of household (UAE citizen or non-citizen). A cluster sample of 40 labour camps was selected. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were collected. Each participant was first tested by Roche Elecsys R Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, followed, when reactive, by the LIAISON R SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay., RESULTS: Among 8831 individuals from households, seroprevalence was 10.4% [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 9.5-11.4], with higher seroprevalence in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain regions compared with those in Al Dhafra. In households, we found no sex difference and UAE citizens had lower seroprevalence compared with those of other nationalities. Among 4855 workers residing in labour camps, seroprevalence was 68.6% (95% CI 61.7-74.7), with higher seroprevalence among workers from Southeast Asia. In households, individuals with higher body mass indexes demonstrated higher seroprevalences than individuals with normal weight. Anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of household populations in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi remained unexposed to SARS-CoV-2.

A total of 2457 persons participated in the study; 584 (23.7%) reported having experienced at least one flu-like symptom since the onset of the pandemic. The maximum SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Cuenca was 13.2% (CI: 12-14.6%) (IgM or IgG positive). Considering PCR confirmed infections, the prevalence was 11% (CI: 10-12.4%). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between rural and urban areas. Participants aged 35-49 years old, living with a COVID-19 positive person, at least six people in a household, physical contact with someone outside the household, a contact with a person outside the home with flu-like symptoms, using public transport, and not having enough resources for living, significantly increased the odds for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Overall, there was good adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Having known someone who tested positive for COVID-19, having a primary or secondary level of education, and having enough resources for living, significantly increased the odds for higher adherence.

We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya., METHODS: We recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance., RESULTS: Crude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CrI 17.5-24.4%).

Like other coronaviridae, the viral transmission occurs mainly through droplets. In addition, the virus has been detected in different clinical specimens, suggesting a potential transmission by other routes, including blood transfusion. However, the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via blood products is still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors from South-Eastern Italy. Moreover, in the seropositive donors, we searched for the presence of the virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Overall, 1,797 blood donors from the Apulia region were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using a commercially available assay. Only 18/1,797 donors (1.0%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; in none of them SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Our results indicate that most of the blood donors in Apulia remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic; further, none had detectable virus both in nasopharyngeal swabs and in blood samples.

METHOD(S): We compared serum Ig levels across platforms of viral antigens and antibodies with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms to a clinically relevant cohort of 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULT(S): In controls, the best-performing virus-specific antibody detection platforms were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (sensitivity 87%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value [PPV] 100%, negative predictive value [NPV] 94%), spike IgG3 (sensitivity 93%, specificity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid protein (NP) IgG (sensitivity 93%, specificity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. Twenty individuals with unknown history had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. Spike IgG3 provided the highest accuracy for predicting serologically positive individuals with virus neutralization activity (misidentified 1/20 unknowns compared to 2/20 for RBD and NP IgG).

Prevalence of coronavirus antibody among 764 frontline healthcare workers at an academic hospital,"Iwuji, Kenneth; Islam, Ebtesam; Nugent, Kenneth ","INTRODUCTION: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a major impact on frontline health care workers. Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced hospitals to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to health care workers is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure among health care workers. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 in frontline healthcare workers at University Medical Center (UMC) and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas. METHOD(S): Blood samples were collected on 764 asymptomatic healthcare workers at University Medical Center and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARSCoV- 2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer. RESULT(S): The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.8%. Six of the 764 participants tested positive. Three of the six participants with positive results had prior COVID-19 diagnosis with mild symptoms managed at home. The other three had asymptomatic infection. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. Possible explanations for this include adequate PPE measures, low COVID-19 infection in Lubbock, Texas, inadequate time for IgG response, and possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract defense system without eliciting a systemic immunologic response.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,76,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726616.88202.9a,634767282,#101694,Iwuji 2021,"",""

In this study, we conducted a serosurvey of asymptomatic infections among food workers and performed serological and cellular response analyses of asymptomatic subjects in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our data showed that up to 5.91% of the food workers carried SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies asymptomatically; however, in 90.4% of them, the antibody level declined over a 2-week period. IgM and IgG antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, were significantly lower in asymptomatic subjects than in recovered symptomatic patients with similar disease courses. Furthermore, the asymptomatic subjects showed lymphopenia and a prominent decrease in the B-cell population, as well as a low frequency of antibody-secreting cells and a low cytokine response.

In this respect, we aimed to develop a serological test for specifically detecting anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies., Methods: We collected serum and saliva samples from 609 individuals who work at TBZMED affiliated hospitals in Tabriz, Iran, from April to June of 2020. Real-time PCR technique was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 genome using specific primers. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was designed based on virus nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, and the collected sera were subjected to IgM and/or IgG analysis., Result: Real-time PCR results showed that 66 people were infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Our designed ELISA kit showed 93.75% and 98% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. In this study, 5.74% of participants had specific IgG against RBD, whereas the percentage for IgM positive individuals was 5.58%. Approximately the same results were observed for S protein. The number of positive participants for NP increased further, and the results of this antigen showed 7.38% for IgG and 7.06% for IgM., Conclusion: The ELISA test beside real-time PCR could provide a reliable serologic profile for the status of the disease progress and early detection of individuals. More importantly, it possesses the potential to identify the best candidates for plasma donation according to the antibody titers. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital employees in Italy - a single center study.,"Marco, Daperno; Guiotto, Cristina; Casonato, Ines; Pagana, Guido; Micalizzi, Sergio; Azzolina, Maria Carmen Rita; Norbiato, Claudio; Cosseddu, Domenico; Rocca, Rodolfo; COVID-Serology in HCP Group","BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak early in 2020 overwhelmed the Italian national health system, and hospitals were considered places at high risk of spreading the infection. We explored specific antibody seroprevalence of all employees at a single hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak, to identify areas of risk in nosocomial setting and to evaluate the usefulness of antibody testing., METHODS: All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined., RESULTS: The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers (95% of the eligible population). Overall, 153 participants (9.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 cases (7.9%) and at least one was positive in 180 cases (11.5%). Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included: being a smoker, working in Emergency or Medicine Departments, being a healthe care practitioner, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and having undergone a nasopharyngeal swab test. The tests were accurate in discriminating infected cases, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.867 using manufacturer-suggested cut-offs and 0.929 using optimized cut-offs. For discriminating symptomatic subjects, this value was 0.915 using optimized cut-offs., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population of hospital workers was overall about 10%, with an excess prevalence in roles and departments associated with contacts with COVID-19 patients.

To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals from four different communities to estimate cumulative incidence of infection. Our results showed that 1,332 individuals (3.77%) showed positive COVID-19 antibody (either IgM or IgG). Males had a lower positivity rate than females (3.02% versus 4.52%). The antibody positivity rates showed a clear trend of increase according to patients' ages and varied among different communities. The results indicate that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Afterwards, a number of public health interventions were implemented, including lock-down, face mask ordinances, and social distancing. Studies that rely on viral RNA testing of symptomatic patients have shown that these multifaceted interventions contributed to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and delayed the epidemic's progression. However, these estimates of confirmed cases may miss large numbers of asymptomatic patients and recovered symptomatic patients who were not tested. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection. The results suggest that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.

Nevertheless, data about risk of infection for health care workers are sparse. METHOD(S): In a large primary care facility, 151 workers underwent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing. In addition, participants had to complete a survey regarding symptoms and their individual risk of infection. RESULT(S): Symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 occurred in 72%, fever in 25% of all subjects. Four workers (2.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.8-7.1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. None of these was free from COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. Source of infection was presumably professional in three of four individuals. CONCLUSION(S): Our systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of health care workers in a large outpatient centre revealed an apparently low rate of 2.6% past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Relative risk for infection following health care profession cannot be derived as data about infection rates in the corresponding general population are lacking.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

We completed serological assays using samples collected from health care workers to identify antibody types associated with SARS-CoV-2 protection and COVID-19 severity. Rare SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies elicited by past CCV infections were not associated with protection; however, the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections was significantly reduced in individuals with higher common betacoronavirus (βCoV) antibody titers. Since antibody titers decline over time after CCV infections, individuals in our cohort with higher βCoV antibody titers were more likely recently infected with common βCoVs compared to individuals with lower antibody titers. Therefore, our data suggest that recent βCoV infections potentially limit the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections through mechanisms that do not involve cross-reactive antibodies.

Here, we investigated the importance of age in household transmission dynamics., Methods: We enroled 112 households (291 participants) in a case-ascertained study in Bergen, Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020, collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in sera collected 6-8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to define household attack rates., Findings: The overall attack rate was 45% (95% CI 38-53) assessed by serology, and 47% when also including seronegative RT-PCR positives. Serology identified a higher number of infected household members than RT-PCR. Attack rates were equally high in children (48%) and young adults (42%). The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members and 42% in RT-PCR negative contacts. Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults. The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever (aOR 3.31 [95% CI 1.52-7.24]; p = 0.003) or dyspnoea (aOR 2.25 [95% CI 1.80-4.62]; p = 0.027) during acute illness., Interpretation: Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT-PCR.

Healthcare workers who face potential COVID-19 exposure are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Estimating the prevalence of infection among healthcare professionals, determining the related risk factors and applying effective infection control measures are essential for the continuity of the health system. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers in our hospital who have participated extensively in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In the study, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test results of 774 healthcare workers between March 24, 2020, and September 10, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Age, sex, profession, and the status of being diagnosed with COVID-19 before the antibody test were determined for the healthcare workers in the study. When the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody results were evaluated, it was determined that 57 healthcare workers were positive, 708 healthcare workers were negative, and 9 healthcare workers were borderline. The seroprevalence among the workers of our hospital was found to be 7.4%. The antibody positivity rate was 75.6% in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and/or thoracic computed tomography and it was found to be 3.5% in individuals without the diagnosis. The semi-quantitative antibody index values of the healthcare workers who were seropositive and diagnosed with COVID-19 before the test (n= 31) and those who did not (n= 26) were statistically compared and a significant difference was found between the two groups (p<0.01). In our study, the highest seropositivity was observed among residents (12.3%) and among nurses (11.1%), respectively. When the seropositivity rates of the residents and the nurses were compared with other occupational groups, the differences were found to be statistically significant (p= 0.04, p= 0.04, respectively). In conclusion, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined as 7.4% among healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital with high patient admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was announced as 0.81% in the press release made by the Ministry of Health of Turkey in July 2020, it is seen that the rate of seroprevalence among health care workers is significantly larger than the community.

Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in residents of Karachi-challenges in acquiring herd immunity for COVID 19,"Zaidi, Samreen; Rizwan, Faiza; Riaz, Quratulain; Naz, Arshi; Waheed, Samra; Shamsi, Tahir; Siddiqui, Asma; Khawaja, Shabnam; Imam, Mehjabeen ","BACKGROUND: The recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global emergency. There is large number of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 that are not reported. Hence, serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies is warranted for a better estimation of the actual number of infected patients to limit the disease spread and to get an idea of herd immunity. METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood Diseases at Pakistan. The study includes healthcare workers (HCWs), community and industrial workers. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. RESULT(S): A total of 1675 samples have been received from three groups of population. The percentage positivity for industrial employees is high (50.3%) for HCW (13.2%) and community population (34%).Total percentage for positive antibodies result is ~36%. CONCLUSION(S): Our seroprevalence is 36%, which still far from herd immunity that needs to be at least 60-70% in population. If we consider acquiring 60% seroprevalence in next few months, then herd immunity is not far from reality, provided the antibodies did not decline with time. Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest a study with larger population to implement stronger and targeted interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

This is especially true for those who attended and were followed up at primary care settings. OBJECTIVE(S): We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of possible cases and among probable cases followed in primary care. METHOD(S): We selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups from a total population of 19 899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona. We also invited all the patients that had been followed by General Practitioners (GPs). For both populations, we used COVID-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassays, which qualitatively assess the presence of patient-generated Immunoglobulins G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). RESULT(S): Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample participated in the study. The mean age was 43.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 21.79] and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.47% (95% confidence interval = 3.44-8.58). Six hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed up by GPs. The mean age was 46.97 years (SD = 20.05) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among possible cases was lower than expected.

The diagnosis of acute infection relies on RT-PCR based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity., METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays., RESULTS: The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection., CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a combined testing strategy utilising assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay.

We performed a serial cross-sectional serosurvey throughout the first pandemic wave among patients from the largest health board in Scotland. Screening of 7480 patient serum samples showed a weekly seroprevalence ranging from 0.10% to 8.23% in primary and 0.21% to 17.44% in secondary care, respectively. Neutralization assays showed that highly neutralizing antibodies developed in about half of individuals who tested positive with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, mainly among secondary care patients. We estimated the individual probability of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantified associated risk factors. We show that secondary care patients, male patients, and 45-64-year-olds exhibit a higher probability of being seropositive. The identification of risk factors and the differences in virus neutralization activity between patient populations provided insights into the patterns of virus exposure during the first pandemic wave and shed light on what to expect in future waves.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

COVID-19 testing in a UK dental practice - results of a pilot study.,"Greenwall, Linda; Cebula, Marcus; Greenwall Cohen, Joseph; Effenberger, Susanne","Objective In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused a disease outbreak that soon became a global pandemic. Dentists are potentially exposed to infectious microorganisms, including SARS-CoV-2, by virtue of the transmission routes and work environment. This study aims to determine the infection load in a dental healthcare setting during the onset of the pandemic in the UK, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of recommended test regimens in order to estimate potential risks for caregivers and patients in a dynamically changing pandemic environment. Methods Twenty-four persons (dental personnel of one dental office and family contacts) were included in this pilot study, and their infection load was determined between March and May 2020 using antigen and antibody tests. Results Of the 24 subjects, three tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were quarantined accordingly. After six weeks, they tested negative for the virus, had built antibodies and had no remaining symptoms, enabling an efficient return to work.

We investigated the potential role of asymptomatic infection and silent transmission in London care homes that reported no cases of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic., Methods: Five care homes with no cases and two care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 (non-outbreak homes) were investigated with nasal swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks later. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on RT-PCR positive samples. Serology results were compared with those of six care homes with recognised outbreaks., Findings: Across seven non-outbreak homes, 718 (387 staff, 331 residents) individuals had a nasal swab and 651 (386 staff, 265 residents) had follow-up serology. Sixteen individuals (13 residents, 3 staff) in five care homes with no reported cases were RT-PCR positive (care home positivity rates, 0 to 7.6%) compared to 13 individuals (3.0 and 10.8% positivity) in two homes reporting a single case.Seropositivity across these seven homes varied between 10.7-56.5%, with four exceeding community seroprevalence in London (14.8%). Seropositivity rates for staff and residents correlated significantly (rs 0.84, [95% CI 0.51-0.95] p <0.001) across the 13 homes. WGS identified multiple introductions into some homes and silent transmission of a single lineage between staff and residents in one home., Interpretation: We found high rates of asymptomatic infection and transmission even in care homes with no COVID-19 cases.

","AIMS & OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of SARSCoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) forced to attend adult patients during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): A retrospective observational study was conducted in a Spanish tertiary care hospital from March to May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 serology tests were performed to all HCW. The PICU attended COVID-19 adult patients between March 19th and April 24th of 2020. Safety preventive measures taken in the PICU and characteristics of the infected HCW were analyzed. RESULT(S): A total of 105 HCW worked in the PICU during COVID-19 pandemic: 78 nurses or nurse assistants and 27 physicians.

Here, we evaluated infection control measures in a prospective longitudinal single-center study at the Vienna General Hospital, the biggest tertiary care center in Austria, with a structurally planned low SARS-CoV-2 exposure. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were assessed by Abbott ARCHITECT chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) in 599 health care workers (HCWs) at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in early April and two months later. Neutralization assay confirmed CLIA-positive sam-ples. A structured questionnaire was completed at both visits assessing demographic parameters, family situation, travel history, occupational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure, and personal protective equipment handling. At the first visit, 6 of 599 participants (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The seroprevalence increased to 1.5% (8/553) at the second visit and did not differ depending on the working environment. Unprotected SARS-CoV-2 exposure (p = 0.003), positively tested family members (p = 0.04), and travel history (p = 0.09) were more fre-quently reported by positively tested HCWs. Odds for COVID-19 related symptoms were highest for congestion or runny nose (p = 0.002) and altered taste or smell (p < 0.001).

We conducted a study to gain further knowledge on prevalence, transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 among preschool children, their parents and caretakers. <h4>Methods</h4> Children, their parents and care givers in 14 childcare facilities in Dresden, Saxony/ Germany were invited to participate in the KiTaCoviDD19-study between July 2020 and January 2021. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed up to 4 times during the study period in all participating adults and personal characteristics as well as epidemiological information of personal SARS-CoV-2 history were obtained. Stool viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed every 2-4 weeks in all participating children. <h4>Results</h4> In total, 318 children, 299 parents and 233 childcare workers were enrolled. The percentage of seropositive adults and SARS-CoV-2 positive detected children rose considerably by January 2021. However, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive children was considerably lower than the rate of seropositive adults. Overall, we detected a maximum of three connected cases in children. About 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children could not be connected to a secondary case within our study population. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The study could not provide evidence for a relevant asymptomatic (“silent”) spread of SARS-CoV-2 in childcare facilities, neither in a low nor a high prevalence setting. This finding adds to the evidence that childcare and educational settings do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. <h4>Table of Contents Summary</h4> This longitudinal study among children, parents and childcare workers provides further insight on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and transmission within childcare facilities. <h4>What’s Known on This Subject</h4> Based on age distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections and previous data of very limited spread of COVID-19 among primary and secondary schools there is reason to believe that children play a less crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission than initially assumed. <h4>What This Study Adds</h4> Previously published studies focus mainly on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools.

It has been shown that the development of potent neutralizing humoral immunity against SARS CoV-2 leads to an increased probability of survival. However, the question of whether immunocompromised patients develop antibodies has not yet been sufficiently investigated; (2) Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were examined in hemodialysis patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation as well as patients after kidney transplantation. Patients were interviewed about symptoms and comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history; (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 16 out of 259 patients (6%). The trend of infections here reflects the general course of infection in Germany with a peak in November/December of 2020. Remarkably, patients on the waiting list experienced only mild disease. In contrast, transplanted patients had to be hospitalized but recovered rapidly from COVID-19. Most interesting is that all immunosuppressed patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after infection; (4) Conclusion(s): Even with extensive hygiene concepts, an above-average number of patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of infections in Germany. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the formation of antibodies even in these immunocompromised patients, we expect vaccination to be effective in this group of patients.

The proportion of HCP infected with COVID-19 is not well-reported. The conversion rate of HCP working in COVID-19 units is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCP working in designated COVID-19 intensive care units (ICU). METHOD(S): HCP who participated in the management of COVID-19 patients in the surgical and medical ICUs were recruited over a 2-month period. Serological testing was performed using CMC-19D SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Rapid Antibody Test (Audacia Bioscience, Windsor, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. Demographic data including age, sex and race were reported. Participants completed a questionnaire identifying the presence or absence of any medical comorbidities or recent symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc). No identifiable data was collected on the participants. RESULT(S): A total of 375 HCP in the surgical and medical ICUs participated in the study. The incidence of positive IgG antibodies was 8% (n=31). The majority of the participants were nurses (n=194, 52%) and female (n=257, 69%). There was no difference in seroconversion rate between medical professions. There was a higher prevalence of positive antibodies in men despite comprising 21% of the participants (p=0.013). A history of fever (p=0.003), chills (p=0.001), cough (p=0.011), wheezing (p=0.001), shortness of breath (p=0.001), loss of taste or smell (p=0.001) were more prevalent in patients with IgG antibodies. Chronic renal disease (p=0.01) was also more prevalent. Self-reporting to the adherence of wearing PPE all or nearly all the time was 95%. People who did not wear PPE all the time had an increased risk of seroconversion (11 vs 5%) but this was not statistically significant (p=0.2). CONCLUSION(S): The seroprevalence of at-risk HCP managing COVID-19 in an area with high prevalence was less than 10% using a rapid antibody test. There was no difference between different HCPs.

The objective is to determine the extent of infection in the general population and the cumulative incidence by age group., Methods: It was carried out with a longitudinal analytical study, in the population of the Lambayeque region, located in the north of Peru. The selection was carried out in multistages (districts, area, household, and finally choosing the interviewee within the house). Seroprevalence was estimated as a positive result of the rapid test whether it was positive IgM or positive IgG. An adjustment was made for the sampling weights used., Results: The seroprevalence found in the region was 29.5%. Young people between 21 and 50 years old presented the highest seroprevalence frequencies. A total of 25.4% were asymptomatic. The most frequent complaint was dysgeusia and dysosmia (85.3% and 83.6%). Dysosmia (PR = 1.69), chest pain (PR = 1.49), back pain (PR = 1.45), cough (PR = 1.44), fever (PR = 1.41), general malaise (PR = 1.27) were associated factors with the higher the frequency of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. Reporting of complete isolation at home decreased the frequency of positivity (PR = 0.80), however, reporting having ARI contact (PR = 1.60), having contact with a confirmed case (PR = 1.51), and going to market (PR = 1.26) increased the frequency of positivity for SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: These results suggest that Lambayeque is the region with the highest seroprevalence in the world, well above Spain, the United States and similar to a study in India.

Substantial Differences in SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Elicited by Natural Infection and mRNA Vaccination,"Assis, Rafael; Jain, Aarti; Nakajima, Rie; Jasinskas, Al; Kahn, Saahir; Palma, Anton; Parker, Daniel; Chau, Anthony; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Muqolli, Fjolla; Khalil, Ghali; Escobar, Jessica Colin; Ventura, Jenny; Davies, Huw; Albala, Bruce; Boden-Albala, Bernadette; Schubl, Sebastian; Felgner, Philip","We analyzed data from two ongoing serologic surveys, a longitudinal cohort of health care workers (HCW) from the University of California Irvine Medical Center (Orange County, CA, USA), collected from May and December 2020 through March 2021, and a cross sectional county-wide study in July 2020 (actOC; Orange County, CA) and a more focused community study in the city of Santa Ana (Santa Ana Cares; Orange County, CA, USA), collected in December 2020 - in order to compare the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and vaccination. In addition, we serially tested 9 volunteers at multiple time points to analyze the time course of vaccine-induced antibody response in more detail. In May 2020, 1060 HCW were enrolled and had finger stick samples collected. Finger stick samples were again collected in December 2020, before vaccination, as well as January, February and March 2021 during vaccination campaign. A total of 8,729 finger stick blood specimens were probed and analyzed for IgG and IgM antibodies using a coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM).The microarray contained 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens including nucleocapid protein (NP) and several varying fragments of the spike protein, as well as 4 SARS, 3 MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens.Based on a random forest based prediction algorithm, between May and December, prior to vaccine rollout, we observed that seropositivity in the HCW cohort increased from 4.5% to 13%. An intensive vaccination campaign with mRNA vaccines was initiated on December 16, 2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. The observed seropositivity of the HCW specimens taken in the last week of January 2021 jumped to 78%, and by the last week in February it reached 93%, and peaked at 98% seropositive in March. The antibody profile induced by natural exposure differed from the profile induced after mRNA vaccination. Messenger RNA vaccines induced elevated antibody (Ab) reactivity levels against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike, and cross-reactive responses against SARS and MERS RBD domains. Nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is an immunodominant antigen induced after natural exposure, is not present in the vaccine and can be used as a biomarker of past exposure. The results show that naturally-exposed individuals mount a stronger anti-spike response upon vaccination than individuals that were not previously exposed. Longitudinal specimens taken at approximately weekly intervals from 9 individuals show variation in the response to the mRNA vaccine, with some showing a vigorous response to the first dose (prime) and others requiring a subsequent dose (boost) to reach high anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels. Antibody titers determined by serial dilution of the specimens were used to accurately compare antibody levels in these samples. mRNA vaccinees after the boost have higher Ab titers (up to 10 times higher) than convalescent plasmas from donors who recovered from natural infection. The results of this study exemplify the time course and outcomes expected from similar mRNA mass vaccination campaigns conducted in other institutions.",2021,,,,,,PPR313376,10.1101/2021.04.15.440089,,#102907,Assis 2021,"",""
No findings of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swabs from patients at an emergency outpatient ophthalmological healthcare facility in a Swedish county hospital: a cross-sectional study,"Granstam, E.; Krifors, A.; Freyhult, E.; Akerblom, H.","Background COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Virus has been found in conjunctiva of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Conjunctivitis has also been reported as a presenting symptom of disease. Objective The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctiva and throat among patients presenting at the emergency outpatient ophthalmological healthcare facility at a county hospital along with investigating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among staff at the department. Methods and Analysis Swabs from conjunctiva and throat of patients were analysed with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples for serological analysis were obtained from staff. A questionnaire was used to investigate symptoms associated with COVID-19 during the last 3 months as well as symptoms for which the patients were seeking ophthalmological healthcare. Results In total, 68 patients and 70 individuals from the staff were included in the study. Conjunctivitis was observed in 7% of patients. One patient, presenting with reduced visual acuity due to preretinal haemorrhage in the macula, was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab. Contact tracing was negative. All other RT-PCR tests were negative. Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was found in 4% of staff. Conclusions Our study demonstrated low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among patients as well as low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-antibodies among staff at the ophthalmological ward.

Here, we report the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with active cancer at the Division of Oncology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, a comprehensive cancer institution in the capital of Lombardy, Milano. Patients and Methods: From April 15th to May 15th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 testing has been performed in patients with active cancer by paired real time-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (Elitech, Torino, IT) and chemiluminescent immunoassays for detection of antiviral IgG in blood (Abbot, Sligo, IR or Diasorin, Saluggia, IT). Active cancer was defined as a solid tumor requiring anticancer treatment or supportive care. Tested patients were either outpatients with at least one suggestive symptom of COVID-19 assessed by telephone triage per local guidelines, or inpatients routinely tested at hospital admission, irrespective of symptoms. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization at Niguarda Hospital during the study period have been tested and results pooled for evaluating concordance of NPS with serology. Result(s): 118 patients were tested by NSP, and paired serology is available at the moment for 63 (53.4%). In the outpatient setting, 517 underwent telephone triage and 58 reported at least one symptom (11.2%). Of these, 3/29 and 3/14 (10.3 and 21.4%) tested positive on NSP and serology, respectively. In the cohort of inpatients, tested regardless of symptoms, 2/82 and 4/42 (2.4 and 9.5%) tested positive on NSP and serology, respectively. Finally, among oncology physicians, 2/34 and 2/34 (5.9%) tested positive on NSP and serology, respectively. 7 additional hospitalized patients displaying COVID-19 disease have been tested. Overall, the accuracy between NSP and serology was 82.5% and concordance was 0.415 (Cohen's k). In 5 cases, serology was positive and NSP negative, whereas the opposite was found in 6. Recruitment and testing are still ongoing at the moment of abstract submission and complete results will be presented. Conclusion(s): In our series of patients with active cancer during a peak period of the pandemic in Lombardy, 11% of outpatients displayed COVID-19 associated symptoms and 10% had positive NSP.

The COVID-19 pandemic was announced by WHO in February 2020. In the Kaliningrad region, the first case (imported) was registered in early March 2020, the beginning of the epidemic increase fell on the 14th week. 2020, and the peak incidence was reached in the 22nd week of the year, after which there was a steady decrease in the number of cases. The study of population immunity was carried out at the 32nd week during the period of the lowest level of intensity of the epidemic process. Purpose of the study. Assessment of the assessment of the level of population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the population of the Kaliningrad region during the period of the epidemic incidence of the population of COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study was carried out as part of the first stage of the Rospotrebnadzor program to assess population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 among the population of the Russian Federation. The selection of volunteers for the study was carried out by a questionnaire survey and subsequent randomization. The analysis includes the results of a survey of 2675 people. The number of volunteers in age groups ranged from 314 to 493 people. The results obtained were processed by the methods of variation statistics. Results. The results obtained showed that the average seroprevalence in the population was 50.2%, while the highest seroprevalence was found in the child age group 1-17 years (66.9%) and among persons aged 18-29 (57.0). No significant gender differences were found (men - 48,3 +/- 1,6%, women - 51,1 +/- 1,1%). The distribution of the proportion of seropositive people in the settlements of the region varied from 33,9% to 59.6%. The largest share of seroprevalence in the representative samples was found among people engaged in art / creativity (55,3%), the smallest - among educational workers (42,0%). Among COVID-19 convalescents, the level of humoral immunity reached 94,6%. Most of the seropositive volunteers (95,2%) did not have any symptoms of COVID-19, that is, they belonged to the category of asymptomatic carriers. Output.

METHODS We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. RESULTS A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P=0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status. CONCLUSIONS The presence of anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the ensuing 6 months.

"Insights from Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G Serology Test Results from a National Clinical Laboratory, United States, March-July 2020",Kaufman H.W.; Chen Z.; Meyer W.A.; Wohlgemuth J.G. ,"Serologic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) provide information on past infection and immune response. To better understand the persistence of immune response and the proportion of the population who can develop one, the authors assessed patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity over time in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or IgG at a large national reference laboratory. More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages >=55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%). IgG serology testing can identify an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that varies based on age, sex, and duration since exposure. Loss of detectable IgG seropositivity occurs, in some patients, over weeks or months. Adults may be infecting household children.Copyright © 2021 Harvey W. Kaufman et al.

COVID19 mortality among cancer patients (pts) is higher than in general population. The identification of asymptomatic COVID19 cancer pts is important from both a personal and a health system point of view as immunosuppression increases COVID19 disease severity. Screening for asymptomatic carriers is being tested in some categories. The best method for screening and monitoring is yet unknown. Material(s) and Method(s): Azienda Usl Toscana Centro Oncology department tested pts receiving chemo-or radio-therapy. Aims were checking the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID19 cancer pts and evaluating the need and the best method for subsequent monitoring. Pts were offered both a quantitative serologic IgM and IgG test (Qt-ST) and a RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (NOS). As the Qt-ST is costly and requires hours for response, in S.M. Annunziata Hospital (SMA), pts were also tested with a qualitative serologic IgM and IgG method (Ql-ST) to collect information on different serologic assays. Result(s): Between May 11th and 17th, 1148 pts receiving an active antineoplastic treatment signed a written informed consent and were screened with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in NOS and Qt-ST. 317 pts in SMA were also tested with Ql-ST. 16 pts refused RT-PCR, 3 Qt-ST and none Ql-ST. 89 pts with haematological malignancy didn't receive ST. Only 0.44% (5/1132) of asymptomatic cancer pts had a positive RT-PCR. 1 of them had COVID19 disease and was declared healed 14 days before screening. All pts with a positive RT-PCR in NOS had a positive Qt-ST for IgM. 1/5 had also IgG positivity. Qt-ST was positive in 26/1145 pts (2.3%): 3 were IgM+/ IgG+, 10 IgM+/IgG-and 13 IgM-/IgG+. 19.2% of pts with a positive Qt-ST (5/26) were asymptomatic carriers of COVID19 disease. In SMA, 6/317 (1.9%) had a positive Qt-ST, 21 (6.6%) a positive Ql-ST and all were negative for RT-PCR in NOS.

The importance of being retrospective': Medical directivities in COVID-19 time,Farolfi A.; Bonfiglioli R.; Paccagnella A.; Mattana F.; Fanti S. ,"Aim/Introduction: More than 2 million people worldwide had tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 200,000 deaths are attributed to this virus. In order to minimize the diffusion of the infection through hospital operators, that are people with highest risk, we analyzed the efficient impact of medical directivities in our hospital unit. Material(s) and Method(s): 66 operators have worked at our high volume PET center located in a red zone from February 2020 until today: 55 in the nuclear medicine unit, 11 in the radiopharmaceutical unit at cyclotron site. In this setting, in order to limit patients and especially operators' exposure, adoption of preventive measures was needed. Our directives were: everyday change of individual protection devices, use of alcohol solution for disinfection (hand and equipment), repeated sanification of ambients during the day, respect of social distancing and limitation of operators contact with patients to the minimum necessary. In addiction, we set up a new entrance triage protocol in order to try to reduce the risk of contact with possible infective patients: nurses measured patients' temperature at their arrival, the head chief checked if the exam requests were appropriate, excluding suspected infective patients in which nuclear imaging tools were not necessary. All the operators underwent serology lab rapid tests on peripheral blood to check the presence of SARS-CoV-2019 IgG and IgM. Result(s): we reduced the number of PET performed every day from 70 before COVID time to around 40. Out of 66, 62 (94%) of our operators had negative tests not only for IgM but also for IgG. Only 4 operators resulted to have IgG positivity; of these, one had positive COVID nasopharyngeal swab (one before and one after blood test) while 2/4 were negative. Conclusion(s): Changing our daily clinical practise we have created a new filter in addition to the face mask, resulting in a free COVID-zone in our department until now. At this point the readers may be thinking that the limit of this study is its retrospective design. But this is the rhythm of the science (oh science, oh yeah): retrospective view is indeed the real power of this study.

"The ""false-positive"" conundrum: IgA reference level overestimates the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.","Caramelli, Bruno; Escalante-Rojas, Maria C; Chauhan, Hiteshi K C; Siciliano, Rinaldo F; Bittencourt, Marcio S; Micelli, Antonio C","Background: On 12 June 2020, Brazil reached the second position worldwide in the number of COVID-19 cases. Authorities increased the number of tests performed, including the identification of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgA, and IgM). There was an overflooding of the market with several tests, and the presence of possible false-positive results became a challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the seroprevalence and immunoglobulin blood levels in a group of asymptomatic individuals using the reference levels provided by the manufacturer., Methods: Levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were determined in blood serum by the same ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. Patients must be free of symptoms., Results: From 20 to 22 May 2020, 938 individuals were tested. There were 441 (47%) men, age 53 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 39-63.2). The sample included 335 (35.7%) subjects aged >=60 years old. Subjects with a positive test were 54 (5.8%) for IgG and 96 (10.2%) for IgA and 42 (4.5%) for both IgG and IgA. The prevalence of IgG and IgA positive test was not different in men and women and not different in individuals under 60 and over 60 years of age. Conversely, analysing only individuals with positive tests, the levels of IgG in positive subjects were significantly higher than those with an IgA positive test, 3.00 (IQR = 1.68-5.65), and 1.95 (IQR = 1.40-3.38), respectively; P = 0.017. Additionally, individuals with isolated IgA positive tests had significantly lower levels of IgA than those with both IgA and IgG positive tests: 1.95 (IQR = 1.60-2.40) and 3.15 (IQR = 2.20-3.90), respectively, P = 0.005. These latter data suggest that IgA shows a deviation of the distribution to the left in comparison to IgG distribution data. Indeed, many subjects reported as IgA positive had immunoglobulin levels slightly elevated., Conclusions: In conclusion, we strongly suggest caution in the interpretation of IgA test results. This recommendation is more important for those with positive IgA just above the reference level. Copyright © 2021 by the Journal of Global Health.

Method(s): A follow-up survey 1 month later (April-May 2020) measured infection by rRT-PCR and IgM, IgA, and IgG to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein by Luminex. Antibody kinetics, including IgG subclasses, was assessed until month 3. Result(s): At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in 501 participants without previous evidence of infection. IgM, IgG, and IgA levels declined in 3 months (antibody decay rates 0.15 [95% CI,. 11-.19], 0.66 [95% CI,. 54-.82], and 0.12 [95% CI,. 09-.16], respectively), and 68.33% of HCWs had seroreverted for IgM, 3.08% for IgG, and 24.29% for IgA. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 (highest levels) and IgG2, followed by IgG3, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusion(s): Continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs remains critical, particularly in high-risk groups. The observed fast decay of IgA and IgM levels has implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to SARS-CoV-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity-defined by the level of antibodies-is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response. This response activity level may be essential for durable protection, potentially explaining why re-infections occur with SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses.",2021,/,Nature communications,12,1,1018,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21336-8,33589636,#81165,Bartsch 2021,"",""

The first case of COVID-19 in New York City was officially confirmed on 1 March 2020 followed by a severe local epidemic1. Here, to understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conduct a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. We describe the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' group, which is enriched in cases of COVID-19 during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group, which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups; seropositive samples were found as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July, seroprevalence remained stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population.

This study aimed to evaluate the value of COVID-19 antibody rapid test assessment in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from 20th March until 20th May 2020. The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate. In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended. Result(s): A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36.14+/-8.70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87.7% were males). Most of the participants (73.3%) had history of exposure. One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47.9%) of them had at least one positive result. Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test; of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG. The rate of positive IgM and IgG in participants with positive chest CT-scan was 1.6 or 1.3 times more than those with negative chest CT-scan, respectively (p < 0.05). The percentage of positive results for both IgM and IgG in participants having positive RT-PCR test was 1.7 times more than those having negative RT-PCR test (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Rapid antibody test could help in diagnosis of COVID-19 in asymptomatic or symptomatic EMS personnel who did not undergo RT-PCR test or the test was reported as negative.

To characterize statewide seroprevalence and point prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rhode Island. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households across Rhode Island in May 2020. Antibody-based and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 were offered. Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans/Blacks were oversampled to ensure adequate representation. Seroprevalence estimations accounted for test sensitivity and specificity and were compared according to age, race/ethnicity, gender, housing environment, and transportation mode. Results. Overall, 1043 individuals from 554 households were tested (1032 antibody tests, 988 PCR tests). The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 2.1% (95% credible interval [CI] = 0.6, 4.1). Seroprevalence was 7.5% (95% CI = 1.3, 17.5) among Hispanics/Latinos, 3.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 15.0) among African Americans/Blacks, and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 2.4) among non-Hispanic Whites. Overall PCR-based prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI = 0.5, 3.1). Conclusions.

SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility,"Abdelmoniem, R.; Fouad, R.; Shawky, S.; Amer, K.; Elnagdy, T.; Hassan, W. A.; Ali, A. M.; Ezzelarab, M.; Gaber, Y.; Badary, H. A.; Musa, S.; Talaat, H.; Kassem, A. M.; Tantawi, O.","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a high-risk category during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis, with frontline HCWs at emergency departments (EDs) may be at an even higher risk. Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt. Methods: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14 th , 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. Results: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR. This illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs regardless of symptoms, and the need for strict measures in securing HCWs to reduce transmission from healthcare facilities to the community during the current pandemic.",2021,Jan,Journal of Clinical Virology,134,,,WOS:000609162400001,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104710,,#81077,Abdelmoniem 2021,"",""

Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the target populations for vaccination. They are relevant not only in the community, but also for critical population subgroups such as nursing homes or health care facilities. They will assist in strategizing the vaccination policy especially since there is limited availability of the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy Objective To evaluate the seroprevalence in Health Care Workers (HCW) at our hospital and to identify parameters which may affect it. Methodology: The Baseline profiling and seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) was assessed among 3258 healthcare workers (HCWs) of Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram, Haryana, India, as a part of an ongoing cohort study.The fully automated LIAISON SARS CoV 2 S1/S2 IgG test using the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for the quantitative determination of anti S1 and anti S2 specific IgG antibodies to SARS CoV 2 was used to test serum samples collected before the receipt of the vaccine. Seroprevalence was evaluated as per gender, age, association with previous Covid-19 diagnosis, use of supplements, and role in the hospital and type of exposure. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 3258 participants tested for IgG serology (S1 and S2 proteins) 46.2% (CI 44.4 to 47.9%) were positive (i.e. had an antibody titre more than 15 Au/ml). Higher seroprevalence was seen in the others ie non clinical health care workers (including management, research personnel, pharmacists, technicians, general duty staff, housekeeping, security, food and beverage, and facility maintenance teams) (50.2 Au/ml) than that in clinical HCW (ie doctors and nurses)where it was significantly lower (41.4 Au/ml, p= 0.0001). Also, people with history of Covid-19 were found to have significantly higher antibody levels (p = 0.0001). Amongst the healthcare workers, doctors and nurses had higher relative risk of acquiring Covid-19 infection (RR = 1.21; 95% C.I.: 1.12 to 1.31). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Seroprevalence in healthcare workers at our hospital is high at 46.2%. It is higher in non-clinical HCW than in clinical HCW . The risk of acquiring Covid 19 infection was higher in clinical HCW and thus, this subgroup may benefit most from vaccination. History of Covid 19 may provide double the protection, in particular in those who had it recently. <h4>Keywords:</h4> SARS CoV 2, vaccination, herd immunity, healthcare workers, seroprevalence",2021,,,,,,PPR282324,10.1101/2021.02.10.21251543,,#80666,Kataria 2021,"",""

Universal polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing demonstrate little to no transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a rural community,Appa A.; Takahashi S.; Rodriguez-Barraquer I.; Chamie G.; Sawyer A.; Duarte E.; Hakim J.; Turcios K.; Vinden J.; Janson O.; Manglik A.; Peluso M.J.; Deeks S.G.; Henrich T.J.; Torres L.; Rodgers M.; Hackett J.; Chiu C.; Havlir D.; Greenhouse B. ,"Background: Limited systematic surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the early months of the US epidemic curtailed accurate appraisal of transmission intensity. Our objective was to perform case detection of an entire rural community to quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural town of Bolinas, California (population 1620), 4 weeks after shelter-in-place orders. Participants were tested between April 20 and 24, 2020. Prevalence by PCR and seroprevalence from 2 forms of antibody testing were performed in parallel (Abbott ARCHITECT immunoglobulin [Ig]G and in-house IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Result(s): Of 1891 participants, 1312 were confirmed Bolinas residents (>80% community ascertainment). Zero participants were PCR positive. Assuming 80% sensitivity, it would have been unlikely to observe these results (P<.05) if there were >3 active infections in the community. Based on antibody results, estimated prevalence of prior infection was 0.16% (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.02%-0.46%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive result on both tests was 99.11% (95% CrI, 95.75%-99.94%), compared with PPV 44.19%-63.32% (95% CrI, 3.25%-98.64%) if 1 test was utilized. Conclusion(s): Four weeks after shelter-in-place, SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rural Northern California community was extremely rare. In this low-prevalence setting, use of 2 antibody tests increased seroprevalence estimate precision. This was one of the first community-wide studies to successfully implement synchronous PCR and antibody testing, particularly in a rural setting.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors after the first COVID-19 wave in Canada,Saeed S.; Drews S.J.; Pambrun C.; Yi Q.-L.; Osmond L.; O'Brien S.F. ,"BACKGROUND: Case detection underestimates the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the first COVID-19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors across Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population-level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at two-week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS-CoV-2 reactive to non-reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. RESULT(S): Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self-identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero-reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. DISCUSSION: Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While >99% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

After the first epidemic wave, we conducted population-based serological surveys to determine extent of infection, risk factors for infection, and neutralization antibody levels to assess the real infections in the random sampled population., Methods: We used a multistage, stratified cluster random sampling strategy to conduct serological surveys in three areas - Wuhan, Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and six provinces selected on COVID-19 incidence and containment strategy. Participants were consenting individuals >1 year old who resided in the survey area >14 days during the epidemic. Provinces screened sera for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG, and total antibody by two lateral flow immunoassays and one magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay; positive samples were verified by micro-neutralization assay., Findings: We enrolled 34,857 participants (overall response rate, 92%); 427 were positive by micro-neutralization assay. Wuhan had the highest weighted seroprevalence (4*43%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]=3*48%-5*62%), followed by Hubei-ex-Wuhan (0*44%, 95%CI=0*26%-0*76%), and the other provinces (<0*1%). Living in Wuhan (adjusted odds ratio aOR=13*70, 95%CI= 7*91-23*75), contact with COVID-19 patients (aOR=7*35, 95%CI=5*05-10*69), and age over 40 (aOR=1*36, 95%CI=1*07-1*72) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among seropositives, 101 (24%) reported symptoms and had higher geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers than among the 326 (76%) without symptoms (30+/-2*4 vs 15+/-2*1, p<0*001)., Interpretation: The low overall extent of infection and steep gradient of seropositivity from Wuhan to the outer provinces provide evidence supporting the success of containment of the first wave of COVID-19 in China.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among North Dakota community pharmacy personnel: A seroprevalence survey.,"Johnson, Amanda; Vincent, Brenda; Carson, Paul; Skoy, Elizabeth","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has disrupted much of the health care system. Despite changes in routine practices, community pharmacists have continuously served their patients throughout the pandemic. Frontline health care workers, including community pharmacy personnel, are at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this observational study was to report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a sample of North Dakota community pharmacy personnel., METHODS: This observational study was conducted in 2 cities in North Dakota with the highest COVID-19 rates at the time of investigation. Community pharmacy personnel were tested for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using a rapid antibody test. In addition to antibody testing, participants completed a questionnaire reporting on demographics, previous COVID-19 exposure, previous COVID-19 symptoms, and personal protection equipment (PPE) practices., RESULTS: A total of 247 pharmacy personnel from 29 pharmacies were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The timing and use of PPE varied by location. Among the 247 community pharmacy personnel, 14.6% tested positive for IgM, IgG, or both. Survey data revealed a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) between a positive antibody test and direct contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio: 2.65 [95% CI: 1.18-5.95]), but there were no statistically significant effects related to the workplace, including PPE use, personnel role, or the number of hours worked. The self-reported loss of taste or smell was the only significant symptom associated with a positive antibody test (18.91 [3.10-115.59])., CONCLUSION: Community pharmacy personnel may be at an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure compared with the general population.

610 ABO and Rh blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in pregnancy,Haizler-Cohen L.; Collins A.; Moncada K.; Davidov A.; Fruhman G. ,"Objective: Previous studies suggest a relationship between ABO and Rh blood groups and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Infection status in these studies was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Antibody testing may be a more accurate method to assess susceptibility since it detects both current and past infection. Universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women, a generally healthy population, will more likely include a higher number of asymptomatic individuals. This is contrary to studies in the non-pregnant population who were more likely to be tested due to symptomatic presentation. Our objective was to correlate ABO and Rh blood groups to SARS-CoV-2 antibody results in pregnant women admitted to labor and delivery (L&D). Study Design: This is a retrospective chart review of women who were admitted to L&D in seven hospitals in the Northwell Health System in New York state between 5/27/20 to 8/23/20. Women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were included in the study. ABO and Rh blood groups were collected for all subjects. Categorical data were analyzed using 2-tailed chi square tests. Result(s): Of 2930 women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results, 448 (15.3%) were seropositive and 2482 (84.7%) were seronegative. The prevalence of A, B, AB and O blood groups were 32.3%, 16%, 4.9% and 46.6% in the antibody positive group and 32.6%, 17.5%, 5% and 44.7% in the antibody negative group. The percentage of Rh positive women was 93.7% and 90.6% in the antibody positive and negative groups, respectively. ABO blood group was not significantly correlated with antibody status, p=0.84. Rh negative women had a statistically significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate, p=0.03. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to report the association between blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among medical students in Copenhagen,"Madsen, Johannes; Nielsen, Jacob P.S.; Fogh, Kamille; Hansen, Cecilie; Nielsen, Pernille; Lange, Theis; Hasselbalch, Rasmus; Garred, Peter; Iversen, Kasper","<h4>Background: </h4> Healthcare workers are at a higher risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. However, detailed knowledge about medical students and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Thus, we measured the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a cohort of Danish medical students. Methods We invited all medical students at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) to participate. A venous blood sample was drawn along with completing a self-report questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and related to symptomatology, social behaviour, and work-life. Seropositive samples were screened for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies. Results Between October 19th and 26th 1,120 students participated in questionnaire, of these 1,096 were included in the study. Of all included 379 (34.58%) of the participants were seropositive. The risk of seropositivity was significantly increased for participants attending two parties at UCPH, on February the 29th and March 6th 2020 (OR 5.96 (95% CI 4.34-8.24, p<0.001). Further, 461 students (42.06%) worked with COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with risk of seropositivity (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03-1.85, p=0.033). The symptom most substantially associated with seropositivity was loss of smell and/or taste (n=183 of all, 31.35%) with an OR of 24.48 (95% CI 15.49-40.60, p<0.001). Conclusion Medical students have the highest reported seropositivity in the Danish healthcare system. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission amongst the students appear to be partly related to working with COVID-19 infected patients, but to a greater extent, their social behaviour.",2021,,,,,,PPR282367,10.1101/2021.02.09.21251421,,#80673,Madsen 2021,"",""

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France., METHODS: Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968., FINDINGS: Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1.9 [SD 0.9] years; range 5 months to 4.4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4.3%; 95% CI 2.6-7.1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7.7%; 4.2-11.6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3.7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1.3-6.8) of the children and 6.8% (3.2-11.5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5.5%; 95% CI 2.9-10.1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5.0% (95% CrI 1.6-9.8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7.1 [95% CI 2.2-22.4])., INTERPRETATION: According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres.

While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community-based survey to estimate DC’s SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity-associated factors. <h4>Methods</h4> A mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27 – August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID-like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity. <h4>Results</h4> Among a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P≤0.006). <h4>Conclusions</h4> These findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC. <h4>What is already known on this subject?</h4> Traditional case-based detection and syndromic surveillance efforts might not identify mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is particularly true among people in the general population who do not have increased risk of severe illness or might not be tested otherwise. Consequently, the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infections might not be known. <h4>What this study adds?</h4> A community-based seroprevalence survey conducted in Washington, DC, during July 27 – August 21, 2020 estimated that 7.6% of the convenience sample had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating prior infection. At the time of this survey, most of the participants reported that they had not been previously infected with or tested for SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight both the value of serologic surveillance in complementing other surveillance methods, and the importance of continued prevention and mitigation measures, such as maintaining physical distances of at least 6 feet, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, practicing frequent hand hygiene, and wearing face masks properly and consistently around people who do not live with you.",2021,,,,,,PPR285055,10.1101/2021.02.15.21251764,,#82272,Sherman 2021,"",""

Methods: We chose 1 588 inhabitants of Mazandaran province with cluster sampling. We measured their SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum levels. Demographics, risk factors, and symptoms were collected. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by age and city and the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol and further stratified by demographic variables and risk factors.

The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in intravenous drug users in comparison to non-drug users,Mohammadi Z.; Eghtesad S.; Hashemi-Shahri S.M.; Tabatabaei S.M.; Sharafkhah M.; Poustchi H. ,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 infection has led to a worldwide pandemic, and new cases are on the rise. Intravenous drug users (IVDU) are presumably at a higher risk of being infected since they have poor personal hygiene, live in groups, and have risky behaviors. The current study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in IVDU in comparison with non-drug users (N-DU). METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on 167 IVDU and 134 N-DU. A questionnaire gathering data on demographics, comorbidities, and use of personal protective equipment was administered to all participants. In addition, 5 cc of blood was taken from each individual to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (Pishtaz Teb SARS-Cov-2 ELISA kits). RESULTS The mean age of N-DU and IVDU were 38.9 +/- 12.9 and 40.38 +/- 10.24 years, respectively. COVID-19 seroprevalence in IVDU was 9.7%, and 4.8% in N-DU, but this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION While the seroprevalence of COVID-19 was not significantly different among the two groups, IVDU should still be considered by policymakers as a high-risk group due to their lifestyle and risky behaviors.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of >10,000 samples at hospitals in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan., Methods: Between August 6 and October 1, 2020, we collected samples of residual blood from the patients who visited or were admitted to five hospitals and a foundation in Hyogo. We tested the samples for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Sera that were positive by ECLIA or CLEIA were analyzed by an immunochromatographic (IC) test and neutralizing activity assay., Results: We tested 10,377 samples from patients aged between 0 and 99 years old; 27 cases (0.26%) were positive on the ECLIA, and 51 cases (0.49%) were positive on CLEIA. In the 14 cases that tested positive on both ECLIA and CLEIA, the positive rates on the IC test and for neutralizing activity were high (85% and 92%, respectively). In 50 cases (0.48%) that were positive by either ECLIA or CLEIA, the corresponding rates were low (20% and 6%, respectively). The positive rate of neutralizing antibody was 0.15%., Conclusions: These results indicate that most Hyogo Prefecture residents still do not have antibodies and should avoid the risk of incurring a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two or more antibody tests should be required for seroepidemiological studies of the antibody for SARS-CoV-2, and a neutralizing activity assay is also essential.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a University Community: A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Student Return to Campus on Infection Risk Among Community Members,"Arnold, Callum; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Herzog, Catherine; Gontu, Abhinay; Bharti, Nita; Small, Meg; Rogers, Connie; Schade, Margeaux; Kuchipudi, Suresh; Kapur, Vivek; Andrew, Read; Ferrari, Matthew","<h4>Background: </h4> Returning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term. Findings Of 345 community participants, 19 (5.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8.1%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20-50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3.24, 2.14-4.91; 1.62, 1.08-2.44; respectively). Interpretation Despite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. Objective(s): To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Result(s): The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. Conclusion(s): At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens. These findings may indicate that non-citizens and less educated individuals may be less attentive to preventive measures.

Eligibility was stratified to meet age, race, and ethnicity quotas that matched regional demographic profiles., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as measured by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay., Results: Among 4675 adult outpatients (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.9] years; 3119 women [66.7%]; 3098 White [66.3%] and 4279 non-Hispanic [91.5%] individuals) presenting for non-COVID-19-associated health care across Virginia, the weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.1%) and ranged from 0% to 20% by zip code. Seroprevalence was notably higher among participants who were Hispanic (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.1%-14.3%), residing in the northern region (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%), aged 40 to 49 years (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8%-7.1%), and uninsured (5.9%; 95% CI, 1.5%-10.3%).

SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroprevalence Among Maintenance Dialysis Patients in the United States.,"Walker, Adam G; Sibbel, Scott; Wade, Curtis; Moulton, Nick; Marlowe, Gilbert; Young, Amy; Fadem, Stephen Z; Brunelli, Steven M","Rationale & Objective: Reported COVID-19 cases underestimate the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients receiving maintenance dialysis are at high risk for COVID-19, and higher case rates have been reported relative to the general population. To better understand infection patterns, we performed a seroprevalence study among maintenance dialysis patients at a large dialysis organization in the United States., Study Design: Cross-sectional., Setting & Participants: We measured IgG antibodies in an IRB-approved study of remnant serum samples collected for routine laboratory screenings in a national sample of 12,932 maintenance dialysis patients (27 May-01 Jul 2020)., Exposure: State, sex, age, and race., Outcomes: Seropositivity; ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 case rate., Analytic Approach: Seropositivity was calculated overall and by state, sex, age, and race. Ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was calculated overall and by state., Results: Overall, 747 (5.8%) of samples were seropositive. Seroprevalence varied by state and was lowest in Kentucky (1.0%) but highest in New York (23.6%). Seroprevalence was similar among men and women. Among samples from patients < 70 years, 6.0%-6.5% were seropositive; whereas 5.2% and 3.9% of samples from patients 70-79 and >= 80 years, respectively, were seropositive. Samples from Black and Hispanic patients were 7.3% and 7.7% positive, respectively, compared to 2.8% of samples from White patients. After adjustment, risk differences among racial groups were lower, but not eliminated. During the study period, the known COVID-19 case rate was 3.3%. The ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was 1.7., Limitations: Imperfect assay sensitivity; results represent infections occurring before July 2020; deidentification prevented comparison of antibodies to previous COVID-19 status for individual patients; may not generalize to patients dialyzing with other providers or in other countries., Conclusions: Seroprevalence was 5.8% among dialysis patients as of 01 July 2020. This indicates the actual number of infections was 1.7-times greater than reported cases. This ratio is lower than reported in the general population, suggesting there were fewer unknown infections among maintenance dialysis patients.

Such data are in short supply, both internationally and in South Africa. The South African blood services (the South African National Blood Service, SANBS and the Western Cape Blood Service, WCBS) are coordinating a nationally representative survey of blood donors, which it is hoped can become a cost-effective surveillance method with validity for community-level seroprevalence estimation. <h4>Methods: </h4> Leveraging existing arrangements, SANBS human research ethics committee permission was obtained to test blood donations collected on predefined days (7th, 10th ,12th ,15th ,20th ,23th and 25th January) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas e411 platform currently available in the blood services’ donation testing laboratories. Using standard methods, prevalence analysis was done by province, age and race, allowing age to be regarded as either a continuous or categorical variable. Testing was performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces. <h4>Results: </h4>: We report on data from 4858 donors - 1457 in EC; 463 in NC; 831 in FS and 2107 in ZN. Prevalence varied substantially across race groups and between provinces, with seroprevalence among Black donors consistently several times higher than among White donors, and the other main population groups (Coloured and Asian) not consistently represented in all provinces. There is no clear evidence that seroprevalence among donors varies by age. Weighted net estimates of prevalence (in the core age range 15-69) by province (compared with official clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case rates in mid-January 2021) are: EC-63%(2.8%), NC-32%(2.2%), FS-46%(2.4%), and ZN-52%(2.4%). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Our study demonstrates substantial differences in dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection between different race groups, most likely explained by historically based differences in socio-economic status and housing conditions. As has been seen in other areas, even such high seroprevalence does not guarantee population-level immunity against new outbreaks – probably due to viral evolution and waning of antibody neutralization. Despite its limitations, notably a ‘healthy donor’ effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.",2021,,,,,,PPR282601,10.21203/rs.3.rs-233375/v1,,#80681,Sykes 2021,"",""

Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population., Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods:</h4> A total of 11703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates Results: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population. Interpretation: Our study estimates the overall national serological prevalence of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to be 11%, with an apparent disparity between regions.",2021,,,,,,PPR276237,10.1101/2021.01.28.21250598,,#77364,Alharbi 2021,"",""
Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgical patients in Australia: a prospective surveillance study,Coatsworth N.; Myles P.S.; Mann G.J.; Cockburn I.A.; Forbes A.B.; Gardiner E.E.; Lum G.; Cheng A.C.; Gruen R.L. ,"BACKGROUND: The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic adults admitted for elective surgery in Australian hospitals. This surveillance activity was established as part of the National Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan. METHOD(S): Participants (n = 3037) were recruited from 11 public and private hospitals in four states (NSW, Vic, SA and WA) between 2 June and 17 July 2020, with an overall 66% participation rate. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was assessed by Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs taken after induction of anaesthesia. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed by analysis of serum collected at the same time using a novel dual-antigen ELISA assay. RESULT(S): No patient (0/3010) returned a positive RT-PCR result. The Bayesian estimated prevalence of active infection of 0.02% (95% probability interval 0.00-0.11%), with the upper endpoint being 1 in 918. Positive serology (IgG) was observed in 15 of 2991 patients, with a strong positive in five of those individuals (Bayesian estimated seroprevalence 0.16%; 95% probability interval 0.00-0.47%).

Modelling studies suggest that school closures contribute to community transmission reduction. However, data among school-attending students and staff are scarce. In November 2020, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany. <h4>Methods:</h4> Students and school staff were examined, oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members performed self-swabs. Individual and institutional infection prevention and control measures were assessed. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected household members were re-tested after one week. Findings: 1119 participants were examined, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff, and 625 household members. Participants reported mainly cold symptoms (19.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight of 24 classes affecting each 1-2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2.7% (95%CI, 1.2-5.0%; 9/338), 1.4% (0.2-5.1%; 2/140), and 2.3% (1.3-3.8%; 14/611) among students, staff and household members, respectively, including quarantined persons. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic. Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask use in school, way to school on foot, and case-contacts outside school. IgG antibodies were detected in 2.0% (0.8-4.1%; 7/347), 1.4% (0.2-5.0%; 2/141) and 1.4% (0.6-2.7%; 8/576), respectively. For three of nine households with infection(s) detected at cross-sectional assessment, origin in school seemed possible. After one week, no school-related, secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1.1%. Interpretation: These data suggest that school attendance under preventive measures is feasible, provided their rigorous implementation. In balancing threats and benefits of open versus closed schools during the pandemic, parents and society need to consider possible spill-overs into their households. Deeper insight is needed into the infection risks due to being a schoolchild as compared to attending school.

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. <h4>Methods: </h4> There were two parts to this study. Between 15 th March 2020 to 15 th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst PCR-negative patients were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. <h4>Results: </h4> In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining PCR-negative patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic, with 19 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. A separate six patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst as inpatient. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond seven months, all had detectable antibodies.A higher proportion of the PCR-positive patients were frail compared to PCR-negative patients (64.3% vs 34.1%, p=0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of six months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in the PCR-positive group compared to the PCR-negative group (18.8% vs 3.8%, p<0.001). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks. This study revealed HD patients mount a humoral response detectable until at least seven months after COVID-19 infection and provides hope of similar protection with the vaccines recently approved.",2021,,,,,,PPR277197,10.21203/rs.3.rs-154513/v1,,#77409,Wickens 2021,"",""

The differences in IgM and IgG antibody prevalence in different serological assays were descriptively analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 637 participants were included in this research. Two staff were IgM positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test (cutoff value: 10 AU/ml) of 51 staff who were IgM positive in the rapid test kit. Six staff were IgG positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test of 56 staff who were IgG positive in the rapid test kit. The proportion of antibody positive staff differed greatly between the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test., CONCLUSIONS: There was a vast difference in the proportions of IgG and IgM antibody positive staff in the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test results.

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India., METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys., FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29 082 individuals from 15 613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6.6% (95% CI 5.8-7.4). Among 15 084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7.1% (6.2-8.2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74.3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case., INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020.

Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay., Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years.

Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants. Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13).

A multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent sociodemographic characteristics associated with a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 1,687 subjects were tested. 91% were male (n= 1,536) and mean age was 37 years old. The overall crude seroprevalence rate was 25.1% (n=422), but differing significantly between different sites, rising from 13.6% (11.2%-16.1%) in mine A to 34.4% (31.1%-37.7%) in mine B and 34.7% (26.2%-43.2%) in Abidjan. Non-resident workers in mines had a significantly lower prevalence rate than those living full-time in mines. Seroprevalence was 26.5% in natives of the Ivory Coast, while people coming from countries other than Africa were less likely to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Among the 422 positive subjects, 74 reported mild symptoms in the three previous months and one was hospitalized for a severe COVID-19 infection. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among mine workers in Ivory Coast is high. The low morbidity observed has probably led to an underestimation of the burden of this infection in West Africa. The high prevalence reported in subjects living in Abidjan, who have not any close contact with mine workers, may be indicative of the real seroprevalence in the Ivory Coast capital.",2021,,,,,,PPR276157,10.1101/2021.01.27.21249186,,#77358,Milleliri 2021,"",""
Cross Sectional Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Health Care Workers in Paediatric Facilities in Eight Countries,Goldblatt D.; Johnson M.; Falup-Pecurariu O.; Ivaskeviciene I.; Spoulou V.; Tamm E.; Wagner M.; Zar H.J.; Bleotu L.; Ivaskevicius R.; Papadatou I.; Jogi P.; Lischka J.; Franckling-Smith Z.; Isarova D.; Grandjean L.; Zavadska D. ,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 which may in part be driven by nosocomial exposure. If HCW exposure is predominantly nosocomial, HCWs in paediatric facilities, where few patients are admitted with COVID-19, may lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and be at increased risk during the current resurgence. AIMS: To compare SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in paediatric facilities in seven European countries and South Africa (n=8). METHOD(S): All categories of paediatric HCWs were invited to participate in the study irrespective of previous symptoms. A single blood sample was taken and data about previous symptoms documented. Serum was shipped to a central laboratory in London where IgG to SARS-CoV-2 was measured. FINDINGS: 4114 HCWs were recruited between 1st May and mid-July 2020. The overall seroprevalence range was 0-16.93%. The highest seroprevalence was in London (16.93%) followed by that in Cape Town, South Africa (10.36%). There were no positive HCWs in the Austrian, Estonian and Latvian cohorts, 2/300 positive in Lithuania (0.66%, 0.18-2.4), 1/124 (0.81%, 0.14-4.3) in Romania, and 1/76 (1.3%, 0.23-7.0) in Greece. CONCLUSION(S): The overall seroprevalence amongst paediatric HCWs is similar to their national populations and linked to national COVID-19 burden. Staff working in paediatric facilities in low burden countries have very low rates of seroprevalence and thus are likely to be susceptible to COVID-19. Their susceptibility to infection may impact on the ability to provide care in the face of increasing COVID-19 disease and highlights the need for appropriate preventative strategies in paediatric health care settings.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies. <h4>Objective</h4> To expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels. <h4>Study Design</h4> The Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification. <h4>Results</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR277509,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250943,,#78588,Molenaar 2021,"",""

SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancy: A cohort study,la Cour Freiesleben N.; Egerup P.; Hviid K.V.R.; Severinsen E.R.; Kolte A.M.; Westergaard D.; Fich Olsen L.; Pratorius L.; Zedeler A.; Christiansen A.-M.H.; Nielsen J.R.; Bang D.; Berntsen S.; Olle-Lopez J.; Ingham A.; Bello-Rodriguez J.; Storm D.M.; Ethelberg-Findsen J.; Hoffmann E.R.; Wilken-Jensen C.; Jorgensen F.S.; Westh H.; Jorgensen H.L.; Nielsen H.S. ,"STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in first trimester pregnancy have an impact on the fetal development as measured by nuchal translucency thickness and pregnancy loss? SUMMARY ANSWER: Nuchal translucency thickness at the first trimester scan was not significantly different in pregnant women with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnant women are more vulnerable to viral infections. Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1019 women with a double test taken between 17 February and 23 April 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between 14 April and 21 May 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving ~12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16) versus negative (n = 966) (P = 0.62). There was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, P = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning COVID-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies. Follow-up studies are needed to establish any risk to a fetus exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Whether LT recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared with the general population is controversial. Here we report the results of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurvey in a large LT recipient cohort. Method(s): A total of 219 LT recipients were enrolled between May 5, 2020, and August 6, 2020, at the University Hospital Heidelberg. Serum blood samples were collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. Result(s): Taking into account known risk factors of arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or leukopenia, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101 of 219 (46.1%) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients, 8 (3.7%) either had a positive test result for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. Five of eight (62.5%) did not show any clinical signs of infection, three of eight (37.5%) had self-limited disease, and none required hospitalization for COVID-19. Two of eight (25%) had known exposure to infected health care staff as the probable source of infection. Conclusion(s): In summary, LT recipients showed a SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate similar to that of the general population with a substantial percentage of unrecognized infections.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,Transplantation Proceedings,,"(Rauber, Tiwari-Heckler, Pfeiffenberger, Merle, Rupp) Department for Gastroenterology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany(Mehrabi, Mieth) Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hosp",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.11.009,2010643112,#76448,Rauber 2021,"",""

Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the United States was performed. <h4>Methods:</h4> Children and adolescents ≤ 19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, United States. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens. <h4>Results:</h4> In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%.

Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed fortnightly questionnaires on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive or prior PCR/antibody test positive) or negative cohort (antibody negative, not previously known to be PCR/antibody positive). Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, possible (subdivided by symptom-status)) depending on hierarchy of evidence. Individuals in the primary infection were excluded from this analysis if infection was confirmed by antibody only. Reinfection rates in the positive cohort were compared against new PCR positives in the negative cohort using a mixed effective multivariable logistic regression analysis. <h4>Findings</h4> Between 18 June and 09 November 2020, 44 reinfections (2 probable, 42 possible) were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 6,614 participants, collectively contributing 1,339,078 days of follow-up. This compares with 318 new PCR positive infections and 94 antibody seroconversions in the negative cohort of 14,173 participants, contributing 1,868,646 days of follow-up.

The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW), through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas in healthcare organizations. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk., METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a cross-sectional and incidence study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the Occupational Health Service (OHS) for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) was 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%.

Enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland: population-based seroprevalence surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic,Dickson E.; Palmateer N.E.; Murray J.; Robertson C.; Waugh C.; Wallace L.A.; Mathie L.; Heatlie K.; Mavin S.; Gousias P.; Von Wissman B.; Goldberg D.J.; McAuley A. ,"Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. Study design/Methods: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods. Result(s): The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area. Conclusion(s): At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health",2021,/,Public Health,190,"(Dickson, Palmateer, Murray, Robertson, Waugh, Wallace, Mathie, Heatlie, Gousias, Von Wissman, Goldberg, McAuley) Public Health Scotland, Glasgow, United Kingdom(Palmateer, Goldberg, McAuley) School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian Universi",132-134,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.014,2010639581,#74458,Dickson 2021,"",""
Bayesian estimation of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Indiana by random testing.,"Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir","From 25 to 29 April 2020, the state of Indiana undertook testing of 3,658 randomly chosen state residents for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, the agent causing COVID-19 disease. This was the first statewide randomized study of COVID-19 testing in the United States. Both PCR and serological tests were administered to all study participants. This paper describes statistical methods used to address nonresponse among various demographic groups and to adjust for testing errors to reduce bias in the estimates of the overall disease prevalence in Indiana. These adjustments were implemented through Bayesian methods, which incorporated all available information on disease prevalence and test performance, along with external data obtained from census of the Indiana statewide population. Both adjustments appeared to have significant impact on the unadjusted estimates, mainly due to upweighting data in study participants of non-White races and Hispanic ethnicity and anticipated false-positive and false-negative test results among both the PCR and antibody tests utilized in the study.

Therefore, we performed this prospective analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in children with known household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and compared their IgG status with the other adults exposed to the index case in the same household. 30 families with a documented COVID-19 index case were included. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. In particular, 16/27 (59,3%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28/53 (52,3%) of pediatric contacts (P > 0.05). Among the pediatric population, children >= 5 years of age had a similar probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (21/39, 53.8%) compared to those < 5 years old (7/14, 50%) (P > 0.05).

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in over 6000 healthcare workers in Spain.,"Varona, Jose F; Madurga, Rodrigo; Penalver, Francisco; Abarca, Elena; Almirall, Cristina; Cruz, Marta; Ramos, Enrique; Castellano Vazquez, Jose Maria","BACKGROUND: Spain has one of the highest incidences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, so Spanish health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of exposure. Our objective was to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence amongst HCW and factors associated with seropositivity., METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluating 6190 workers (97.8% of the total workforce of a healthcare-system of 17 hospitals across four regions in Spain) was carried out between April and June 2020, by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and related clinical data. Exposure risk was categorized as high (clinical environment; prolonged/direct contact with patients), moderate (clinical environment; non-intense/no patient contact) and low (non-clinical environment)., RESULTS: A total of 6038 employees (mean age 43.8 years; 71% female) were included in the final analysis. A total of 662 (11.0%) were seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (39.4% asymptomatic). Adding available PCR-testing, 713 (11.8%) employees showed evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before antibody testing, 482 of them (67%) had no previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Seroprevalence was higher in high- and moderate-risk exposure (12.1 and 11.4%, respectively) compared with low-grade risk subjects (7.2%), and in Madrid (13.8%) compared with Barcelona (7.6%) and Coruna (2.0%). High-risk [odds ratio (OR): 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-2.62] and moderate-risk (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.32-2.37) exposures were associated with positive IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after adjusting for region, age and sex. Higher antibody titres were observed in moderate-severe disease (median antibody-titre: 13.7 AU/mL) compared with mild (6.4 AU/mL) and asymptomatic (5.1 AU/mL) infection, and also in older (>60 years: 11.8 AU/mL) compared with younger (<30 years: 4.2 AU/mL) people., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW is a little higher than in the general population and varies depending on regional COVID-19 incidence. The high rates of subclinical and previously undiagnosed infection observed in this study reinforce the utility of antibody screening. An occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to working in a clinical environment was demonstrated in this HCW cohort. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021; all rights reserved.

In this study, we estimated the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort of Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March 2020. <h4>Methods:</h4> We conducted a population-based study of transmission tested each participant using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test from Orient Gene Biotech and used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. Here we report results from the baseline (13 to 18 July 2020) and the first month of follow-up (13 to 18 August 2020) study. Findings: We enrolled a total of 716 participants and estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0%-73.4%), a test-re-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0%-68.3%), and an incidence of new exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.2%) data that suggest that transmission is ongoing but is occurring at low levels.

Interpretation: Iquitos demonstrates one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of COVID-19 worldwide.

Therefore, studying the manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in transplant recipients is of particular importance., METHODS: One hundred twelve transplant patients consecutively visiting the outpatient department of 2 German transplant centers were included in this study after providing written informed consent. The patients were interviewed about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and history. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were measured concomitantly in patient sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: The risk of severe COVID-19 according to 2 recent scores differed among the analyzed patients. All patients were well educated about their presumed higher risk of a severe COVID-19 and described performing self-isolation wherever possible. Nevertheless, 20 patients reported contact with someone suspected of having COVID-19 or who tested positive shortly thereafter (18%). Despite this relatively high exposure, no clinically relevant case of COVID-19 was reported. Though SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were found in 3 patients (3%); 2 patients were asymptomatic and only 1 had mild COVID-19 symptoms and positive RT-PCR 4 weeks earlier. There were no occult SARS-CoV-2 infections, as demonstrated by negative PCR tests., CONCLUSION: Despite the high exposure level, the incidence of COVID-19 remained very low.

However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50-59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden of infection and disease in populations. <h4>Key points</h4> <h4>Question</h4> We aimed to implement a fully remote seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV-2, leveraging electronic methods and at-home self-collection of specimens to engage a representative study population. <h4>Findings</h4> The population enrolled reflected the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts, revealing a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 3.15% and higher risk of previous infection associated with healthcare workers/their cohabitants, those with comorbidities, lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in age groups 18-29 and 50-59 years old. <h4>Meaning</h4> High engagement and positive feedback from participants as well as quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies.",2021,,,,,,PPR265314,10.1101/2021.01.14.21249824,,#75374,Aatresh 2021,"",""

Method(s): HCWs at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, filled in questionnaires and provided serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody screening by Euroimmun IgG assay in March-April 2020. Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+). Result(s): The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4% of those RT-PCR-negative. The rate of previously unidentified cases was 0.7% (8/1067) and asymptomatic ones 0% (0/36). Conclusion(s): Undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases among HCWs proved rare. An increased risk was associated with Covid-19-dedicated wards. Particularly high rates were seen for wards with liberal HCW-HCW contacts, highlighting the importance of social distancing also among HCWs.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2021,/,Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease,39,"(Kantele, Laaveri, Jarvinen) Infectious Diseases, Inflammation Center, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Finland(Kantele, Pakkanen, Mero, Patjas) Human Microbiome Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finlan",101949,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101949,2010430315,#74432,Kantele 2021,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the general population and high-risk occupational groups across 18 cities in Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study,Poustchi H.; Darvishian M.; Mohammadi Z.; Shayanrad A.; Delavari A.; Bahadorimonfared A.; Eslami S.; Javanmard S.H.; Shakiba E.; Somi M.H.; Emami A.; Saki N.; Hormati A.; Ansari-Moghaddam A.; Saeedi M.; Ghasemi-Kebria F.; Mohebbi I.; Mansour-Ghanaei F.; Karami M.; Sharifi H.; Pourfarzi F.; Veisi N.; Ghadimi R.; Eghtesad S.; Niavarani A.; Ali Asgari A.; Sadeghi A.; Sorouri M.; Anushiravani A.; Amani M.; Kaveh S.; Feizesani A.; Tabarsi P.; Keyvani H.; Markarian M.; Shafighian F.; Sima A.; Sadjadi A.; Radmard A.R.; Mokdad A.H.; Sharafkhah M.; Malekzadeh R. ,"Background: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. Method(s): In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). Finding(s): From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. Interpretation(s): Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

We assessed age effects and clinical utility of serum SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies and serum inflammatory markers. Serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels were measured using chemiluminescence assays from Diazyme (Poway, CA), while serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin were measured with immunoassays obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). In 79,005 subjects, IgG and IgM levels were positive (≥1.0 arbitrary units [AU]/mL) in 5.29% and 3.25% of subjects, respectively. In antibody positive subjects, median IgG levels were 3.93 AU/mL if <45 years of age, 10.18 AU/mL if 45-64 years of age, and 10.85 AU/mL if ≥65 years of age (p<0.0001). In SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases, family members and exposed subjects (n=1,111), antibody testing was found to be valuable for case finding, and persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic symptoms. In non-hospitalized and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n=278), median IgG levels in AU/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects (n=100), 14.83 in positive outpatients (n=129), and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients (n=49, p<0.0001).

The RESPONSE (REDS-IV-P Epidemiology, Surveillance and Preparedness of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic) study conducted monthly cross-sectional serosurveys of 1000 routinely obtained donor samples in 6 metropolitan regions (see table). Study Design/Methods: Samples were captured monthly from March or April through June 2020. Siteswere selected based on reports of epidemic activity or as low prevalence control regions. Donations from COVID- 19 convalescent plasma donors were excluded. Coded samples, with routinely collected demographic data and zip code of residence, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Ortho VITROS anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 Total Ig (data reported below) with planned confirmation of reactivity on Roche Elecsys NC Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Results/Findings: Table 1 shows donor seroreactivity with 95% CI. For all sites, seroreactivity was <1.0% (range 0.1%-0.9%) at the beginning of the surveillance period. Donor seroreactivity in New York City (NYC) was about 10-fold higher in April through June as compared to March and was much higher than in other locations. There were modest increases in seroreactivity over the study timeframe for all other sites. Conclusion(s): Modest increases in seroreactivity from baseline were found in all sites, with the largest increase in NYC. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of routinely obtained blood donor samples allows for detection of asymptomatic and recovered COVID-19 cases and enables future estimation of infection incidence by geographic and other demographic parameters.

Enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland: population-based seroprevalence surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic.,"Dickson, E; Palmateer, N E; Murray, J; Robertson, C; Waugh, C; Wallace, L A; Mathie, L; Heatlie, K; Mavin, S; Gousias, P; Von Wissman, B; Goldberg, D J; McAuley, A","OBJECTIVES: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time., STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON RSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods., RESULTS: The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area., CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.

Other studies have assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies in HCWs, with disparate findings regarding risk based on role and demographics., Methods: We screened 3904 employees and clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 virus positivity and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G at a major New Jersey hospital from April 28 to June 30, 2020. We assessed positive tests in relation to demographic and occupational characteristics and prior coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms using multivariable logistic regression models., Results: Thirteen participants (0.3%) tested positive for virus and 374 (9.6%) tested positive for IgG (total positive: 381 [9.8%]). Compared with participants with no patient care duties, the odds of positive testing (virus or antibodies) were higher for those with direct patient contact: below-median patient contact, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.71 and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-2.48; above-median patient contact, aOR = 1.98 and 95% CI = 1.35-2.91. The proportion of participants testing positive was highest for phlebotomists (23.9%), maintenance/housekeeping (17.3%), dining/food services (16.9%), and interpersonal/support roles (13.7%) despite lower levels of direct patient care duties. Positivity rates were lower among doctors (7.2%) and nurses (9.1%), roles with fewer underrepresented minorities.

While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or tobacco use is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. <h4>Methods: </h4> Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n= 8,214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. <h4>Result: </h4> s Compared to people with self-identified “excellent” or very good health status, those reporting “good” or “fair” health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> In a statewide, community-based population drawn for seroprevalence studies, we find that overall health status is associated with infection rates.

Respiratory/aerial droplets transmission and the high number of ""hidden"" asymptomatic cases play a critical role in the rapid spread of the virus across countries. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population is currently unknown. It has been estimated that undocumented infections were the source for #80% of the documented cases before traveling restriction policies took place. Serological evaluation is essential for investigating the extent of SARS-CoV-2. Even more, assessing the prevalence of anti-SARSCoV-2 in hospital staff offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and at higher risk of contagious. Method(s): The study enrolled a total of 3242 employees of our hospital, ""Policlinico Riuniti"" of Foggia. The employees' group was stratified in 3 subgroups according to their relative exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high, intermediate, and low-risk groups). We used a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech) to study the seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies (IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid and spike proteins). The cut-off was set to 8 AU/mL for both IgG and IgM (specificity of 98,8% and 100%, respectively). A control group of 83 samples sera collected before the Italian COVID-19 outbreak (2018-19) was also tested. Healthcare workers with IgG or IgM concentration above 6.0 and below 8.0 AU/mL were considered borderline. Nevertheless, all of them were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA presence (AllplexTM 2019 n-CoV Assay, Seegene). Result(s): Sixty-two individuals (1.9%, 1.4-2.3%, 95% CI) tested positive for at least one antibody anti-SARS-CoV-2.

From April, in Emilia-Romagna Region, the screening for all HCWs has started through serological tests. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies (Abs) anti SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs affiliated to AUSL of Modena. Method(s):We analysed data on asymptomatic HCWs, to assess the immunological status for the regional screening, that allows Abs to be detected every two weeks. In case of positivity to serological test, SARSCoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal/oropharingeal swab takes place by RT-PCR. Result(s): From 30 March to 31 May 2020, 7711 HCWs were screened using commercial immunocromatography and chemiluminescent tests to detect specific Abs IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2. 7361 (95.4%) were IgG and IgM negative while 350(5%) were IgG and/or IgM positive. In particular, 72 (0.9%) were IgG+ and IgM+, 233 (3%) were IgG+ and IgM-, 45 (0.6%) were IgG- A nd IgM+. At follow up, 4.6% of analyzed subjects were positive, of these 4.2% was IgG+ and only the 0.4% was IgM+. The RT-PCR performed on positive HCWs revealed that 7% of them was positive for viral RNA. Conclusion(s): Serological tests could bridge the gap between the disease and symptoms onset, allowing to detect both active and past infection when used as screening. Results of serological tests were influenced by several factors: In asymptomatic people it is difficult to establish the moment of contact, so it is plausible that the serological tests were negative because the body hasn't had the time to develop the antibodies. Conversely, detection of a very low percentage of IgM in conjunction with high IgG levels could be due to a remote contact with the virus, but also due to a scarce sensibility of tests.

Although new anti-coronavirus antibodies in patients may be identified by immunological methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, the conclusive diagnosis of the disease is by the molecular RT-PCR process. We used a population-based seroepidemiological survey to quantify the proportion of the exposed population with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and evaluated whether the antibodies are a marker of total or partial immunity to the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to the virus. This cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CoVID-19 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, between April and end of October 2020. Specimens of clotted and heparinized blood (2ml) were collected from the patients. The serum and plasma were separated and stored at −80  C until use. We examined serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies from 1375 in-patients admitted to our hospitals using ELISA kits. In total, 1375 participants were enrolled in this study, and SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were detected using IgM‐IgG antibody assay in 291 patients. Among the seropositive patients studied, 187 were men (64.3%), and 104 were women (35.7%) (P<0.05). The mean age of the patients was 49 years; the majority (27%) were in age group 31-40 years. Also, the lowest frequency of cases was reported in the age group of 1-10 years (P <0.05). We determined the seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 for IgM or IgG antibodies to be 21.2%. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among SARS‐CoV‐2 patients [P=0.05; Odd Ratio=1.61(0.90-2.91)]. Conventional serological assays in SARS‐CoV‐2 cases, such as the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, have a high-throughput advantage and minimize false-negative rates that occur with the RT-PCR method.

We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions. <h4>Findings</h4> We estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%-14.3%] by the end of November.

This study is the first investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia., OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the current pandemic., METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20 to 25 May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher prevalence compared to citizens (odds ratio 13.6, p = 0.001). Having a secondary education as the highest level of education was also significantly associated with high seroprevalence compared to higher education (odds ratio 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%), Madinah (4.1% with an OR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.12-1.94), Jeddah (2.3%; OR 0.27; 95%CI: 0.31-2.25), and Qassim (2.9 %, OR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from the seroprevalence in Makkah region., CONCLUSIONS: At the early stage of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low but was higher among non-citizens These findings showed that non-citizens and the less educated may be less attentive to preventive measures.

Population-based seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a high-altitude setting in Peru,"HUAMANI, CHARLES; Velasquez, Lucio; Montes, Sonia; Mayanga Herrera, Ana; Bernabe-Ortiz, Antonio","<h4>Background: </h4> Little evidence exists about the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at high altitude. We aimed to estimate the population-based seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco at the end of the first wave. <h4>Methods:</h4> A population-based survey was conducted in September 2020 in three settings in Cusco: (1) Cusco city at 3300 meters above the sea level (m.a.s.l.), (2) the periphery of Cusco (Santiago, San Jeronimo, San Sebastian, and Wanchaq) at 3300 m.a.s.l., and (3) Quillabamba city, located at 1050 m.a.s.l. People aged greater than or equal 18 years within a family unit were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on identifying total antibodies (IgM and IgG) anti- SARS-CoV-2 in serum using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence test. Findings: We enrolled 1924 participants from 712 families. Of the total, 637 participants were COVID-19 seropositive. Seroprevalence was 38.8% (95%CI: 33.4%-44.9%) in Cusco city, 34.9% (95%CI: 30.4%-40.1%) in the periphery of Cusco, and 20.3% (95%CI: 16.2%-25.6%) in Quillabamba. In 141 families (19.8%; 95%CI: 17.0%-22.8%) the whole members were positive to the test. Living with more than three persons in the same house, a positive COVID-19 case at home, and a member who died in the last five months were factors associated with COVID-19 positivity. The smell/taste alteration was the symptom most associated with seropositivity (aOR= 14.27, 95% CI: 8.24-24.70); whereas always wearing a face shield (aOR= 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46- 0.84) or a facial mask (aOR= 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.88) reduced that probability. Interpretation: Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco was high, with significant differences between settings. Wearing masks and face shields were associated with lower rate of infection; however, efforts must be made to sustain them over time since there is still a high proportion of susceptible people.

This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV2 sero-positivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection. <h4>Methods</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi-urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecsys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS-CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained. <h4>Findings</h4> 1058 individuals (10·14%) had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. A follow-up on 346 sero-positive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of sero-positive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one-fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for sero-positivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1·79, 1·43 – 2·24, 2·81561E-06), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2·23, 1·92 – 2·59, 6·43969E-26), non-smokers (1·52, 1·16 – 1·99, 0·02) and non-vegetarianism (1·67, 1·41 – 1·99, 3·03821E-08). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for sero-positivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups -O was associated with a lower risk. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In a first-of-its-kind study from India, we report the sero-positivity in a country-wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much-sought-for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies. <h4>Funding</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR)",2021,,,,,,PPR266477,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249713,,#75413,Naushin 2021,"",""

According to the WHO situation report at April 17, there were 22, 073 HCWs contracted the infection. Whether the infection control policy and practice in the hospital setting can protect the HCWs is an important issue., METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan to explore the sero-prevalence rate among HCWs. The participants are enrolled on a voluntary basis. A structured questionnaire was collected to gather the epidemiology character and risk factors for potential exposure. ELISA tests as Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) were used to detect antibody responses. If any of the tests was positive, a western blot assay was used for confirmation., RESULTS: There were 194 HCWs participated during July 1 to Aug. 31, 2020. The mean age was 36.3 +/- 10.4. More than half of the participants had possible hospital associated risk for COVID-19 exposure (110/192, 57.3%) and 64 had possible community risk for COVID-19 exposure (64/194, 33.0%). There was only one participant had positive test by Architect IgG test and confirmed to be negative for seasonal coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

While understanding of the incidence and case-fatality rates has increased, there are limited data concerning seroprevalence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare workers during the pre-pandemic period. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers in the southern part of Kyoto city, Japan. Methods: We prospectively recruited healthcare workers from a single hospital between April 10 and April 20, 2020. We collected serum samples from these participants and quantitatively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Five (5.4%), 15 (16.3%), and 72 (78.3%) participants showed positive, borderline, and negative serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status, respectively. We found the mean titer associated with each antibody status (overall, positive, borderline, and negative) was clearly differentiated. Participants working at the otolaryngology department and/or with a history of seasonal common cold symptoms had a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer (p = 0.046, p = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Five (5.4%) and 15 (16.3%) participants tested positive and borderline, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody during the COVID-19 pre-pandemic period. These rates were higher than expected, based on government situation reports.

Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG Antibodies in a Cohort of Municipal First Responders.,"McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D","BACKGROUND: Although first responders (FRs) represent a high-risk group for exposure, little information is available regarding their risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs)., METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups., RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07)., CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.",2021,/,Prehospital and disaster medicine,,"bdf, 8918173",1-13,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X2000151X,33397545,#72396,McGuire 2021,"",""
"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serology testing in the homeless population in the City of Rome, Italy. Preliminary results.","Ralli, Massimo; Cedola, Chiara; Urbano, Suleika; Latini, Ottavio; Shkodina, Natalia; Morrone, Aldo; Arcangeli, Andrea; Ercoli, Lucia","Background: The development of COVID-19 pandemic has affected all segments of the population; however, it had a significant impact on vulnerable subjects, such as in people experiencing homelessness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 spread in homeless persons in the city of Rome, Italy. Design and Methods: Patients included in the study underwent a clinical evaluation and rapid antibody analysis on capillary blood for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptomatic patients were not included in the screening and immediately referred to local hospitals for further evaluation. Results: One-hundred seventy-three patients of both sexes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serological test. Age range was 10-80 years; people came from 35 different countries of origin and 4 continents. Test results were negative for most patients (170-98.2%); two patients had positive IgM (1.2%) and one patient had positive IgG (0.6%). Conclusions: Our study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people experiencing homelessness in the city of Rome, Italy. Most patients were negative for COVID- 19, although several factors may have had an impact on this result, such as the exclusion of symptomatic patients, the limited sensitivity of rapid serological tests in the initial stage of infection and the prevention measures adopted in these populations.

Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly. <h4>Methods</h4> Five companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR. <h4>Results</h4> Among home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Personnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employees likely to be pre-symptomatic for COVID-19 can be readily identified by screening. Increased attention for protection of employees as well as of the elderly they serve is warranted.",2020,,,,,,PPR256286,10.1101/2020.12.18.20248511,,#72863,Hassan 2020,"",""

Neutralisation assays showed that around half of individuals who tested positive by ELISA assay, developed highly neutralising antibodies, mainly among secondary care patients. We estimated the individual probability of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantified associated risk factors. We show that secondary care patients, males and 45-64-year-olds exhibit a higher probability of being seropositive.

The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. <h4>Methods:</h4> We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months.

The Silent Pandemic COVID-19 in the Asymptomatic Population,"Stout, Robert; Rigatti, Steven","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world there is a great need to understand the dynamics of spread. Currently the seroprevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 doubles every 3 months, this silent epidemic of new infections may be the main driving force behind the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases. Public health official quickly recognized that clinical cases were just the tip of the iceberg. In fact a great deal of the spread was being driven by the asymptomatically infected who continued to go out, socialize and go to work.

Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience from 181 patients in New York.,"Fierro, Luca; Nesheiwat, Nora; Naik, Hetanshi; Narayanan, Praveena; Mistry, Pramod K; Balwani, Manisha","SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid beta-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients.

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020., METHODS: Participants (n=7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in person method. IgG to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR positive test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3-4 months., CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicate more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentration produced from these asymptomatic exposures is similar to IgG levels occurring after documented non-hospitalized COVID-19, which is considerably lower than that produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.",2021,/,JCI insight,,101676073,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.146148,33755598,#91197,Demonbreun 2021,"",""
"Seroprevalence of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in a random sample of inhabitants of the katowice region, Poland",Zejda J.E.; Brozek G.M.; Kowalska M.; Baranski K.; Kaleta-Pilarska A.; Nowakowski A.; Xia Y.; Buszman P. ,"Lack of knowledge around seroprevalence levels of COVID-19 in Poland was the reason for the implementation of a seroepidemiological study in the Katowice Region (2,100,000 inhabitants). In October-November 2020, a questionnaire examination and measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were performed in a random sample of the general population (n = 1167). The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies and to assess their host-related correlates. The prevalence of IgG seropositivity was 11.4% (95% CI: 9.5-13.2%) and IgM seropositivity was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.5-5.8%). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was found in 4.8% of subjects. A positive IgG test was statistically significantly associated with age (inverse relationship), a person's contact with a COVID-19 patient, quarantine, and two symptoms in the past: fever and loss of smell/taste. Positive IgG tests were less prevalent in subjects who had diagnoses of arterial hypertension, diabetes, or rheumatologic disorders. IgM test positivity was associated with quarantine and loss of smell/taste only with no effect of chronic diseases found. In Poland, in the period October-November 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was larger than earlier estimates obtained in other European countries, probably reflecting the measurements obtained during the ""second wave"" of the epidemic.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Public Health England initiated a study, COVID-19 Surveillance in School KIDs (sKIDs), in primary schools when they partially reopened from June 1, 2020, after the first national lockdown in England to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion in staff and students., METHODS: sKIDs, an active, prospective, surveillance study, included two groups: the weekly swabbing group and the blood sampling group. The swabbing group underwent weekly nasal swabs for at least 4 weeks after partial school reopening during the summer half-term (June to mid-July, 2020). The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds., FINDINGS: During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 4.1 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 0.1-21.8) per 100 000 students and 12.5 (two of 16 038; 1.5-45.0) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (11.2%; 95% CI 7.9-15.1) of 816 students and 209 (15.1%; 11.9-18.9) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=0.13 for students and p=0.20 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=0.37). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (73.9%) of 816 students and 1015 (73.5%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted. By December, 2020, 55 (5.1%; 95% CI 3.8-6.5) of 1085 participants who were seronegative at recruitment (in June, 2020) had seroconverted, including 19 (5.6%; 3.4-8.6) of 340 students and 36 (4.8%; 3.4-6.6) of 745 staff members (p=0.60)., INTERPRETATION: In England, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low in primary schools following their partial and full reopening in June and September, 2020., FUNDING: UK Department of Health and Social Care.

The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can provide crucial epidemiological information about the extent of infections independent of virologically detected case numbers. There is no large population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey from Norway; thus we estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Norway before the introduction of vaccines and described its distribution across demographic groups. In November-December 2020, a total of 110,000 people aged 16 years or older were randomly selected from the National Population Register and invited to complete a questionnaire and provide a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. The response rate was 30%; compliance rate for return of DBS samples was 88%. The national weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 0.9% (confidence interval 0.7-1.0). Seroprevalence was highest among those aged 16-19 years (1.9%, 0.9-2.9), those born outside the Nordic countries 1.4% (1.0-1.9), and in the counties of Oslo 1.7 % (1.2-2.2) and Vestland 1.4% (0.9-1.8). The ratio of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (0.9) to the cumulative incidence of virologically detected cases by mid-December 2020 (0.8%) was slightly above one. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low before the introduction of vaccines in Norway and was comparable to virologically detected cases, indicating that most cases in the first 10 months of the pandemic were detected.

Prevalence and determinants of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the general population of the Gardena Valley,"Melotti, Roberto; Scaggiante, Federica; Falciani, Michela; Weichenberger, Christian; Foco, Luisa; Lombardo, Stefano; De Grandi, Alessandro; von Laer, Dorothee; Mahlknecht, Angelika; Pramstaller, Peter; Pagani, Elisabetta; Meier, Horand; Gaertner, Timon; Troi, Christina; Mascalzoni, Deborah; Pattaro, Cristian; Mian, Michael","<h4>Background: </h4> Community-based studies are essential to quantify the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for unbiased characterization of its determinants and outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Gardena valley, a major Alpine touristic destination which was struck in the expansion phase of the COVID-19 pandemic over the winter 2020. Methods. We surveyed 2244 representative study participants who underwent swab and serum antibody tests. We made multiple comparisons among the Abbott and Diasorin bioassays and serum neutralization titers. Seroprevalence accounted for the stratified design, non-response and test accuracy. Determinants and symptoms predictive of infection were analyzed by weighted multiple logistic regression. Results. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.9% (95% confidence interval: 25.2%, 28.6%) by June 2020. The serum antibody bioassays had modest agreement with each other. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the serum neutralizing capacity showed better performance of the Abbott test at lower than the canonical threshold. Socio-demographic characteristics showed no clear evidence of association with seropositivity, which was instead associated with place of residence and economic activity. Loss of taste or smell, fever, difficulty in breathing, pain in the limbs, and weakness were the most predictive symptoms of positive antibody test results. Fever and weakness associations were age-dependent. Conclusion. The Gardena valley had one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in Europe.

The vaccination program started in January 2021 and here we report effectiveness of the first dose of Covishield in generating antibody response and its kinetics. We further report differences in the quantitative antibody response amongst individuals who had pre-existing antibodies to SARS CoV2 and those who did not. In a group of 135 healthcare workers administered Covishield, we measured antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 directed against the spike protein (S-antigen) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S quantitative antibody detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) at days 0, 7, 14, and 28. In 44 subjects (32.5%) who had already developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at day 0 (before immunization), it was observed that antibody response was significantly higher at each time point, with the maximum increase seen between days 0 and 7. In contrast the sero-negative group (n=91) started developing antibody response only after 14 days or later. Three sero-negative individuals did not develop any antibody response even at day 28 of vaccination. It is noted that median antibody response at 28 days in seronegative subjects was similar to that of seropositive subjects at baseline (day 0) and was on a rising trajectory. Our data suggests that ChAdOx1 is highly immunogenic, particularly so where previous SARS CoV2 antibody-response is established.

Additionally, PCR testing was conducted separately for residents and staff with fever of >=37.5 degreeC. Facility-wide serological testing, including rapid kit testing and quantitative assay, was conducted twice over 1 month apart., RESULTS: A total of 322 PCR and 257 antibody tests were performed. 37 (24.3%) of the 152 individuals (25/99 residents, 25.3%; 12/53 staff, 22.6%) were identified as PCR-positive. Seven residents died with a mortality of 7.1% (7/99). Among the 37 individuals, 10 (27.0%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.

While molecular and rapid antigen tests are targeted for early diagnosis, immunoassays have a larger role in epidemiological studies, understanding longitudinal immunity, and in vaccine development and response. Method(s): The performance of the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay was evaluated against the Beckman ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in New Mexico, and against the Siemens ADVIA Centaur COV2G assay in New York. Discordant samples were parsed using a microneutralization assay. Result(s): A SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate of 23.8% was observed in the samples tested in New York (September 2020), while in the same month the positivity rate was 1.5% in New Mexico.

By the end of 2020, Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, had <2500 PCR-confirmed cases corresponding to 0.1% of the ∼1.8 million national population. We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in urban Guinea-Bissau. <h4>Methods</h4> We measured IgG antibody in point-of-care rapid tests among 140 staff and associates at a biometric research field station in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, during November 2020. <h4>Results</h4> Of 140 participants, 25 (18%) were IgG-positive. Among IgG-positives, 12 (48%) reported an episode of illness since the onset of the pandemic. Twenty-five (18%) participants had been PCR-tested between May and September; 7 (28%) were PCR-positive. Four of these 7 tested IgG-negative in the present study. Five participants reported a death in their house, corresponding to a crude annual death rate of 4.5/1000 people; no death was attributed to COVID-19. <h4>Conclusions</h4> In spite of low official number of COVID-19 cases, our serosurvey found a high prevalence of IgG-positivity. Most IgG-positives had not been ill. The official number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases grossly underestimates the prevalence during the pandemic.

The first aim was pursued by conducting a bibliographic research, consulting the principal regulatory sources. The second one was achieved with an observational study by administering a questionnaire and performing a serological test. The various protection measures imposed by national and regional legislation were analyzed. Two hundred and eighty-six pharmacists (about 8% of the invited ones) responded to the survey. Ten pharmacists reported a positive result to the serological test.

Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated., RESULTS: 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects., CONCLUSIONS: the seroprevalence values estimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence. Furthermore, the implementation of this test allowed the identification and isolation of completely asymptomatic subjects, that could have been identified only through screening with tests for viral RNA.",2020,/,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,44,5-6 Suppl 2,200-206,,https://dx.doi.org/10.19191/EP20.5-6.S2.119,33412811,#72728,Alessi 2020,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey estimates are affected by anti-nucleocapsid antibody decline.,"Bolotin, Shelly; Tran, Vanessa; Osman, Selma; Brown, Kevin A; Buchan, Sarah A; Joh, Eugene; Deeks, Shelley L; Allen, Vanessa G","We analyzed 21,676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected between March-August, 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates.

A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms,"Wagner, Angelika; Guzek, Angela; Ruff, Johanna; Jasinska, Joanna; Scheikl, Ute; Zwazl, Ines; Kundi, Michael; Stockinger, Hannes; Farcet, Maria; Kreil, Thomas; Hoeltl, Eva; Wiedermann, Ursula","<h4>Background</h4> In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. <h4>Findings</h4> We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG-borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies. <h4>Interpretation</h4> RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection. <h4>Funding</h4> This study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020 0225 104). <h4>Key points</h4> Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> At the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the interpretation of the antibody’s qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in low-prevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first months, assays targeting these antigen specificities – in contrast to RBD-specific antibody measurements – are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild COVID-19.",2020,,,,,,PPR256355,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248604,,#72873,Wagner 2020,"",""

As the capital of China, Beijing took a series of strict containment measures during the past several months. However, the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing has not been evaluated. METHODS During April 15-18, 2020, residents in Beijing were enrolled using a multi-stage cluster random sampling technique in four districts with top COVID-19 incidence and one district without case reported. Communities and households in each district were randomly selected based on probability proportional to size. Blood samples were collected and antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were tested by two kinds of colloidal gold kits. All colloidal gold positive serums and 20 randomly selected negative serums were then tested by Micro-neutralization assay. A likelihood ratio test was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals of seroprevalence with the Clopper-Pearson exact method. RESULTS A total of 2,184 residents participated in this survey, among which 13 were tested positive by colloidal gold tests. Of those who tested positive, 8 were IgM positive, 3 were IgG positive, 1 was total antibody positive, 1 was both IgM and total antibody positive. Among the 13 seropositive samples and 20 randomly selected seronegative samples, no positive sample was detected by micro-neutralization assay. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing was estimated no higher than 0.17%. CONCLUSIONS The seroprevalence of COVID-19 was low in April suggests that the comprehensive control measures to prevent and control further spread in Beijing was effective. However, the majority of the residents in Beijing were still susceptible to infection; the risk of rebound should be noted due to low population-level immunity.",2021,,,,,,PPR263311,10.21203/rs.3.rs-141246/v1,,#73070,Wang 2021,"",""

Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time., RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002).

At the state of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases.

Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil., METHODS: Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020., FINDINGS: Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed., INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil.

Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals., INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation., RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs., CONCLUSIONS: The results of serosurveillance suggest that the population of Ahmedabad is still largely susceptible.

Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers., RESULTS: In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness., CONCLUSION: Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers.

The reliability of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing - a pilot study in asymptomatic health care workers in a Croatian university hospital.,"Lapic, Ivana; Rogic, Dunja; Segulja, Dragana; Kralik Oguic, Sasa; Knezevic, Josip","AIM: To evaluate three fully automated serological assays in terms of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and perform SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing among asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) at the University Hospital Center Zagreb., METHODS: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays., RESULTS: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.",2020,/,Croatian medical journal,61,6,485-490,,,33410294,#72672,Lapic 2020,"",""

Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers. <h4>Methods</h4> Residual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures. <h4>Results</h4> We tested 112,941 individuals (∼10% of Qatar’s urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Fewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar’s urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.",2021,,,,,,PPR261818,10.1101/2021.01.05.21249247,,#73032,Coyle 2021,"",""
"Prospective Longitudinal Serosurvey of Health Care Workers in the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in a Quaternary Care Hospital in Munich, Germany.","Weinberger, Tobias; Steffen, Julius; Osterman, Andreas; Mueller, Tonina T; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Wratil, Paul R; Graf, Alexander; Krebs, Stefan; Quartucci, Carolina; Spaeth, Patricia M; Grabein, Beatrice; Adorjan, Kristina; Blum, Helmut; Keppler, Oliver T; Klein, Matthias","BACKGROUND: High infection rates among health care personnel in an uncontained pandemic can paralyze health systems due to staff shortages. Risk constellations and rates of seroconversion for health care workers during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still largely unclear., METHODS: Health care personnel (n=300) on different organizational units in the LMU Munich University Hospital were included and followed in this prospective longitudinal study in the period of March 24 until July 7, 2020. Participants were monitored in intervals of two to six weeks using different antibody assays for serological testing and questionnaires to evaluate risk contacts. In a subgroup of infected participants, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to perform whole genome sequencing for outbreak characterization., RESULTS: Health care workers involved in patient care on dedicated COVID-19 wards or on regular non-COVID-19 wards showed a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion compared to staff in the emergency department and non-frontline personnel. The landscape of risk contacts in these units was dynamic, with a decrease of unprotected risk contacts in the emergency department and an increase on non-COVID-19 wards. Both, the intensity and number of risk contacts, were associated with higher rates of seroconversion. On regular wards, staff infections tended to occur in clusters, while infections on COVID-19 wards were less frequent and apparently independent of each other., CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for front-line health care workers was increased during the first pandemic wave in Southern Germany. Stringent measures for infection control are essential to protect all patient-facing staff during the ongoing pandemic. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the country’s most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection. <h4>Design</h4> In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors ( n= 2,100) and pregnant women ( n= 2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14 th March and 11 th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls ( n= 595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807. <h4>Setting</h4> Healthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital. <h4>Participants</h4> None of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples. <h4>Results</h4> Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened ( n= 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response. <h4>Conclusions</h4> In agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. <h4>General abstract</h4> Public health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women ( n= 4,100) were sampled at random between 14 th March-11 th December 2020. All individuals ( n= 200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls ( n= 595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.",2020,,,,,,PPR258021,10.1101/2020.12.24.20248821,,#72921,Dopico 2020,"",""
Clustering and longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school-children: prospective cohort study of 55 schools in Switzerland,"Ulyte, Agne; Radtke, Thomas; Abela, Irene; Haile, Sarah; Berger, Christoph; Huber, Michael; Schanz, Merle; Schwarzmueller, Magdalena; Trkola, Alexandra; Fehr, Jan; Puhan, Milo; Kriemler, Susi","<h4>Background and aims</h4> The facilitating role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 infection spread is still debated and the potential of school closures to mitigate transmission unclear. In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. <h4>Methods</h4> Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools. <h4>Results</h4> Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously seropositive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with high participation rate, 0, 1-2 or ≥3 seropositive children were present in 73 (56%), 50 (38%) and 7 (5%) classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation of random effects (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Under a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Trial registration</h4> ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717 . https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717",2020,,,,,,PPR256319,10.1101/2020.12.19.20248513,,#72867,Ulyte 2020,"",""

Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary., METHODS: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning., RESULTS: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected.

Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A logistic regression model adjusting for these factors showed significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk. Robust informatics solutions for HCW exposure data are essential to inform occupational monitoring.",2020,,,,,,PPR257126,10.1101/2020.12.22.20242362,,#72880,Hanrath 2020,"",""

These findings provide preliminary guidance regarding population susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which will aid in establishing policy toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and control., Objective: To understand the seropositivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies among children in Beijing, China, evaluate the susceptibility of children in Beijing to SARS-CoV-2, and provide prima facie evidence to guide SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control., Methods: IgM/IgG antibody kits (colloidal gold) were used to conduct preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies in serum samples of children who presented to Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, having fever or requiring hospitalization, from March 2020 to August 2020. Statistical analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity was performed according to the children's general demographic characteristics, timing of admission to hospital, presence of pneumonia, and viral nucleic acid test results., Results: The study included 19 797 children with both IgM and IgG antibody results. Twenty-four children had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive results (positive rate of 1.2), twelve children had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive results (positive rate of 0.6). Viral nucleic acid test results were negative for the above-mentioned children with positive antibody findings; during the study, two children exhibited positive viral nucleic acid test results, but their anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody results were negative. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody seropositivity was higher in the <1-year-old group than in the >=6-year-old group. The rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM seropositivity was highest in August from March to August; IgG results did not significantly differ over time. The rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG seropositivity among children with and without suspected pneumonia did not significantly differ between groups., Interpretation: During the study period, the rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody seropositivity were low among children who presented to Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University. The findings suggest that children in Beijing are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection; COVID-19 prevention and control measures should be strengthened to prevent disease in children.

Assessment and Comparison of Two Serological Approaches for the Surveillance of Health Workers Exposed to SARS-CoV-2.,"Russo, Antonio; Calo, Federica; Di Fraia, Alessandra; Starace, Mario; Minichini, Carmine; Gentile, Valeria; Angelillo, Italo Francesco; Coppola, Nicola; Vanvitelli-COVID-19 Group","Background and Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic performance of an LFA compared with an ELISA test in a cohort of HWs operating in a COVID-19 unit of a teaching hospital in southern Italy., Methods: We performed an observational, prospective, interventional study including 65 COVID-19 unit personnel. On a total of 196 serum samples (at least 2 serum samples for each HW), LFA and ELISA tests for SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM were performed. Also, 32 serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients at least 21 days before sampling, and 30 serum samples of patients obtained up to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak in China, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively., Findings: Of the 65 HWs enrolled, 6 were positive in LFA; overall, of the 196 serum samples, 20 were positive in LFA. All ELISA tests performed on serum samples collected from HWs were negative. The specificity of LFAs was 90.77% considering the 65 HWs and 89.80% considering all the 196 health workers serum samples analyzed. Considering the data on HWs, ELISA test for SARS-COV-2 antibodies showed a specificity of 100%, including all the 196 serum samples collected, and 100% including the 65 HWs. The ELISA and LFAs performed after 21 days last COVID-19 patient was discharged were all negative., Conclusion: LFAs compared to ELISA tests result in less specificity, considering COVID-19 negative personnel and patients. Thus, LFAs seem to be not adequate in the active surveillance of HWs.

We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China., Methods: We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020., Findings: Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 91.1% (41 of 45 [95% CI 78.8-97.5]) for the microneutralisation assay, 57.8% (26 of 45 [42.2-72.3]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 66.7% (30 of 45 [51.1-80.0]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 73.3% (33 of 45 [58.1-85.4]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 97.6-100.0]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (2.7%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified., Interpretation: Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis. The role of age-related cross reactive non-neutralising antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 warrants further investigation., Funding: Richard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, Shaw Foundation (Hong Kong), Michael Tong, Marina Lee, and the Government Consultancy Service (see acknowledgments for full list).

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design., METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382., FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time., INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care.

Prevalence of COVID-19 Among Typical Ambulatory Care Patients in a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom.,"Arif, Muhammad; Maaref Doost, Mina","Objectives This observational retrospective study was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among typical ambulatory care patients. In our hospital, ambulatory care unit (ACU) was supposed to be a COVID-19 free area, and, hence, as per the guidelines, even basic personal protection equipment (PPE) was not provided during the early phase of pandemic. Methods We identified 443 patients who presented to our ACU between March and June 2020 with chest pain or shortness of breath suspected of pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome, which normally makes the bulk of referrals to ACU. As per protocol, patients with COVID-19-like symptoms, e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell, were excluded from ACU. We then, reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans for radiological evidence of COVID-19, and lab data for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody tests, to find out if any of our patients turned out to be suffering from COVID-19 unexpectedly. Results We found 13 patients with radiological or serological evidence of COVID-19, which equates to a prevalence of 2.93% in this cohort of our ambulatory care patients. Four in our patient cohort showed radiological features that were highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia; 47 chest CT scans were performed, which may suggest a prevalence of around 8.5% (4/47) on radiological ground if everyone was offered a CT scan. Conclusions Due to limited access to data, our result is likely an underestimation of the actual prevalence of COVID-19 among our ACU patients, highlighting the need to review the safety and PPE guidelines for the ambulatory clinic and any similar out-patient areas.

In this work, we aim to evaluate a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) regarding analytical, diagnostic, operational and clinical characteristics. Our work takes the form of a population-based study in the principality of Liechtenstein, including 125 cases with clinically well-described and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1159 individuals without evidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 cases were tested for antibodies in sera taken with a median of 48 days (interquartile range, IQR, 43-52) and 139 days (IQR, 129-144) after symptom onset. Sera were also tested with other assays targeting antibodies against non-RBD-S1 and -S1/S2 epitopes. Sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 93.2-99.1), whereas specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.4-99.9). Antibody levels linearly decreased from hospitalized patients to symptomatic outpatients and SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms (p < 0.001). Among cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers (p = 0.04), and patients with fever had higher antibody levels than patients without fever (p = 0.001). Pan-SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig in SARS-CoV-2 infection cases significantly increased from first to second follow-up (p < 0.001). A substantial proportion of individuals without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed non-S1-RBD antibody reactivities (248/1159, i.e., 21.4%, 95% CI, 19.1-23.4). In conclusion, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig assay offers favorable and sustained assay characteristics allowing the determination of quantitative associations between clinical characteristics (e.g., disease severity, smoking or fever) and antibody levels. The assay could also help to identify individuals with antibodies of non-S1-RBD specificity with potential clinical cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2.",2020,/,Journal of clinical medicine,9,12,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9123989,33317059,#66566,Schaffner 2020,"",""

So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21-30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/mul; IQR = 40.6-178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5-3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49).

First wave of COVID-19 did not reach the homeless population in Aarhus.,"Storgaard, Signe Freja; Eiset, Andreas Halgreen; Abdullahi, Farhiya; Wejse, Christian","INTRODUCTION: The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic affecting the whole world. Lower health literacy and higher mortality rates in the homeless and vulnerable population compared with the background population potentially leaves this group or people more exposed to COVID-19. This study assessed the vulnerable population of Aarhus in relation to COVID-19 infection., METHODS: Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed., RESULTS: We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals. On the day of testing, COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, coughing and/or sore throat were found in 63 of 240 (26.3%) of the participants in April and in 26 of 123 (21.1%) in June. In the April testing round, 175 of 291 (59.9%) reported to be born in Denmark. The corresponding number for the June testing round was 84 of 138 (60.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite their vulnerable profile, the vulnerable citizens tested in Aarhus were not infected with COVID-19 at the testing day and very few participants carried antibodies., FUNDING: Testing was funded by Aarhus University Hospital., TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital employees in Italy,Casonato I.; Daperno M.; Guiotto C.; Pagana G.; Norbiato C.; Azzolina M.C.; Rocca R.; Cosseddu D. ,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak early in 2020 overwhelmed the Italian national health system, and hospitals were considered places at high risk of spreading the infection. We explored specific antibody seroprevalence of all employees at a single hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak, to identify risky pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of antibody testing. Method(s): All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). The SARSCoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) is a chemiluminescence immunoassay for quantifying antispike 1 (S1) and anti-spike 2 (S2) IgG on the LIAISON XL automated analyzer; according to the manufacturer, a titer <12 AU/ml is negative, from 12 to 15 is equivocal, and >15 is positive; values below 3.8 are undetectable. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for quantifying anti-capsid IgG on the ARCHITECT i System analyzer; according to the manufacturer, a titer <1.4 is negative and >1.4 is positive. Subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG underwent a confirmatory nasopharyngeal swab PCR test. Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined. Result(s): The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers. Overall, 153 participants (9.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 cases (7.9%) and at least one was positive in 180 cases (11.5%). Factors associated with SARSCoV-2 seropositivity included: Being a smoker, working in Emergency or Medicine Departments, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population of hospital workers was overall about 10%, with an excess prevalence in roles and departments associated with contacts with COVID-19 patients.",2020,/,Biochimica Clinica,44,SUPPL 2,S91,,,633621653,#67571,Casonato 2020,"",""

The Sheba Medical Center healthcare workers' children's school: can we open schools safely?.,"Kriger, Or; Lustig, Yaniv; Cohen, Carmit; Amit, Sharon; Biber, Asaf; Barkai, Galia; Talmi, Liron; Gefen-Halevi, Shiraz; Mechnik, Bella; Regev-Yochay, Gili","OBJECTIVE: The role of school closure in mitigating COVID-19 transmission has been questioned. In our medical center, during a 9-week national lockdown, an alternative school was opened for healthcare workers' (HCW) children with a small number of children per class and strict symptom surveillance. After lockdown was lifted we screened children and their parents for SARS-CoV2 serology., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCW parents and their children after one teacher contracted COVID-19 following exposure at home and 53 children were exposed, isolated and tested by RT-PCR. We compared families with children attending the alternative school to families with children who remained at home during the 9-week lockdown. Epidemiologic and medical data were collected via a short questionnaire; naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and blood was collected for SARS-CoV2 IgA and IgG titres., RESULTS: A total of 435 children attended the Sheba alternative school. Among the 53 children exposed to the infected teacher, none tested positive by RT-PCR. Of these, 18 children-parent pairs were tested for serology and all were negative. A total of 106/435 (24%) children and their 78 parents were recruited for the cross-sectional study; 70 attended the Sheba school and 36 did not. Approximately 16% of children in either group reported symptoms (11/70 in the school group and 6/36 in the 'stay home' group), yet SARS-CoV2 was not detected by PCR in any, and previous exposure, as determined by serological tests, was low and not significantly different between the groups., CONCLUSION: In an alternative school for HCW's children, active during COVID-19 national outbreak, we found no evidence of increased infection compared with children that stayed home.

Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+)., RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure.

We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020., RESULTS: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689)., CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's.

However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate., METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity)., FINDINGS: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included., INTERPRETATIONS: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran., FUNDING: Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted. Therefore, rapid antibody tests have been suggested as an efficient screening tool during pregnancy., CASES: We analysed the clinical performance during pregnancy of a rapid, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. We performed a universal screening including 169 patients during their last trimester of pregnancy. We present a series of fourteen patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 ICA rapid test result. ICA results were always confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIA) for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies as the gold standard. We observed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 50% in pregnant women, involving a significantly lower diagnostic performance than reported in non-pregnant patients., DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that although ICA rapid tests may be a fast and profitable screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they may have a high false positive rate and low positive predictive value in pregnant women. Therefore, Immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies must be verified by other test in pregnant patients.",2020,/,Annals of clinical biochemistry,,"52y, 0324055",4563220980495,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004563220980495,33242972,#63372,FabreEstremera 2020,"",""
"Insights from Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G Serology Test Results from a National Clinical Laboratory, United States, March-July 2020",Kaufman H.W.; Chen Z.; Meyer W.A.; Wohlgemuth J.G. ,"Serologic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) provide information on past infection and immune response. To better understand the persistence of immune response and the proportion of the population who can develop one, the authors assessed patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity over time in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or IgG at a large national reference laboratory. More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages >=55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%). IgG serology testing can identify an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that varies based on age, sex, and duration since exposure. Loss of detectable IgG seropositivity occurs, in some patients, over weeks or months.

Scope: The study was aimed at verifying the effectiveness of measures to contain the virus spread among workers in the workplace as required by the agreement between the social partners signed on March 14, 2020. Methods: The survey was carried out at workplaces by trained health physicians and almost all company workers enrolled on a voluntary basis. Each worker was tested for viral RNA using nasopharyngeal swab and for IgM and IgG antibodies by drawing venous or capillary blood, according to the availability of tests at that difficult period. Results: Swab-positive workers were 0.3%, and subjects with positive serological tests were 1.6% of the total workers examined. Discussion: The diagnostic test is based on the search for viral RNA through nasopharyngeal swab. To evaluate the immunological status of workers the CLIA or Elisa quantitative serological test should be preferred.

Serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline health care personnel at 13 hospitals and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during April 3-June 19, 2020, and again approximately 60 days later to assess this timeline. The percentage of participants who experienced seroreversion, defined as an antibody signal-to-threshold ratio >1.0 at baseline and <1.0 at the follow-up visit, was assessed. Overall, 194 (6.0%) of 3,248 participants had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (1). Upon repeat testing approximately 60 days later (range = 50-91 days), 146 (93.6%) of 156 participants experienced a decline in antibody response indicated by a lower signal-to-threshold ratio at the follow-up visit, compared with the baseline visit, and 44 (28.2%) experienced seroreversion. Participants with higher initial antibody responses were more likely to have antibodies detected at the follow-up test than were those who had a lower initial antibody response. Whether decay in these antibodies increases risk for reinfection and disease remains unanswered.

Gastroenterology services include emergency and critical care along with the endoscopy procedures, which have aerosol-generating potential. This study was aimed at auditing the COVID-19 impact on HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department of our hospital. Method(s): The COVID-19 status of 117 HCWs was collected using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroassay. COVID-19 positivity was correlated with demographic characteristics, job profile, area of work, and medical history. Result(s): Thirty-eight HCWs (32.48%) showed evidence of COVID-19 using PCR (23.93%) or only IgG assay (8.55%). Endoscopy technicians (68.75%) exhibited significantly higher (P = 0.003) COVID-19 incidence compared to doctors (20.69%). Those working in the critical care units exhibited a trend toward higher COVID-19 incidence (42.86%). None of the six HCWs who received adequate hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis developed evidence of COVID-19. All the HCWs with COVID-19 disease recovered. However, there was a considerable loss of ""man-days."". Conclusion(s): In our setting, we observed a high COVID-19 risk for HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department, with the highest risk among the endoscopy technicians. A more stringent triaging and pretesting of patients, as well as HCWs, might decrease the risk of COVID-19.

IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported.

Due to its high infectiousness, the health care staff is even more exposed. Nevertheless, there is still very limited information about it, especially among pediatricians., OBJECTIVE: To assess the seroprevalence of SARSCoV- 2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital 3 months after the first case in Argentina. To explore if certain demographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity., METHODS: Cross-sectional study of physicians randomly selected from the list of workers of a children's hospital. All of them were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by chemiluminescence (immunoglobulins G/M [IgG/IgM]) and their epidemiological history was collected (age, place of residence, professional category, contact with infected people) in order to explore the association between predictors and seropositivity., RESULTS: A total of 116 physicians were included; their average age was 45.6 +/- 13.3 years. Of them, 62.9 % were staff physicians, and the rest, residents; 42.2 % worked in areas designated for direct care of COVID-19 patients. Four (3.5 %) referred contact with infected people without the appropriate protection, and 6 (5.2 %), having traveled to risk areas. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) were only detected in one of the professionals. Because of this, it was impossible to assess the association between potential predictors and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., CONCLUSION: It was observed that only 0.9 % of the physicians from a children's hospital had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions., Objective: To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time., Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020., Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >=65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status., Results: Of 177919 serum samples tested, 103771 (58.3%) were from women, 26716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites., Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction.

Secondarily we aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre during weeks 10 to 19 of 2020, coinciding with the Spanish lockdown. We tested 769 serum samples obtained from routine serological testing during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy for specific IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive)., RESULTS: Seropositivity increased from 0% to 21.4% (95% CI 11.8-31.0) during the study period, of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall outcomes were favorable with a significant increased rate of preterm birth in G4 vs G1 (21.4% vs 6.7%) and cesarean/operative delivery (50% vs 26.9%). Asymptomatic and mild cases did not have differences regarding pregnancy course when compared to seronegative women.

Searching for COVID-19 Antibodies in Czech Children-A Needle in the Haystack,Bloomfield M.; Pospisilova I.; Cabelova T.; Sediva A.; Ibrahimova M.; Borecka K.; Magner M. ,"During the COVID-19 pandemics of 2020, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), both adults and children were shown to mount a specific antibody response to the virus. As infected children often exhibit mild symptoms or even remain asymptomatic, they are likely to be under tested for the direct presence of the virus. Mapping the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies frequency informs more accurately on the disease prevalence and helps guide the protective and therapeutic strategies. To date, only few seroprevalence studies included children. In the Czech Republic, in April 2020, the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was estimated not to exceed 1.3%. In July and August, 2020, we screened 200 children (0-18 years of age), who attended the pediatric department of a large hospital in Prague for various COVID-19-unrelated reasons, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Zero seropositive subjects were found.

Methods All subjects presenting at the major hospital of Milan from May-11 to July-5, 2020, underwent a serological screening by chemiluminescent assays. Those admitted were further tested by RT-PCR. Results The cumulative anti-N IgG seroprevalence in the 2753 subjects analyzed was of 5.1% (95%CI = 4.3%-6.0%), with a peak of 8.4% (6.1%-11.4%) 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses (March-20). 31/106 (29.2%) anti-N reactive subjects had anti-S1/S2 titers >80 AU/mL. Being tested from May-18 to June-5, or residing in the provinces with higher SARS-CoV-2 circulation, were positively and independently associated with anti-N IgG reactivity (OR [95%CI]: 2.179[1.455-3.264] and 3.127[1.18-8.29], respectively). In the 18 RT-PCR positive, symptomatic subjects, anti-N seroprevalence was 33.3% (95% CI: 14.8%-56.3%). Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Milan is low, and in a downward trend after only 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses. Italian confinement measures were effective, but the risk of contagion remains concrete.

Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt., METHODS: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data., RESULTS: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing., RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08-0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8-4.1), p < 0.0001., CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine.

Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; ii.) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence., METHODS: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany that was quarantined from March 22nd to April 5th after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the villages' population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compromised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from May 13th to May 22nd 2020 six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak., RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR- and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: Median 2.9 vs. 7.2 IgG-index, p=0.002; DS-assay: Median 45.2 vs. 143 AU/mL, p=0.002).

Concurrently, a transversal study was carried out in patients on active systemic cancer treatment for symptomatology and seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cohort 2)., RESULTS: A total of 215 patients (Cohort 1) were admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between February 28 and April 30, 2020, and 17 died (7.9%). A medical record of cancer was noted in 43 cases (20%), 6 of them required Intensive care unit ICU attention (14%), and 7 died (16%). There were thirty-six patients (83%) who tested IgG/IgM positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies presented a lower ratio of seroconversion (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). In Cohort 2, 166 patients were included in a symptoms-survey and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Any type of potential COVID-19-related symptom was referred up to 67.4% of patients (85.9% vs. 48.2% vs. 73.9%, for patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies respectively, p < 0.05). The seroprevalence ratio was 1.8% for the whole cohort with no significant differences by patient or treatment characteristics., CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer present higher risks for hospital needs for COVID-19 infection. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion may be a concern for patients on immunosuppressive therapies. Patients receiving systematic therapies relayed a high rate of potentially COVID-19-related symptoms, particularly those receiving chemotherapy.

Overall, among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between May 5 and 15, 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyzer. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables., RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positives for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least 1 symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those resulting seropositive was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was 3-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially of younger age, and/or who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large prospective cohort study of elite football players in Germany (May-June 2020): implications for a testing protocol in asymptomatic individuals and estimation of the rate of undetected cases.,"Mack, Dietrich; Gartner, Barbara Christine; Rossler, Annika; Kimpel, Janine; Donde, Katrin; Harzer, Oliver; Krutsch, Werner; von Laer, Dorothee; Meyer, Tim","OBJECTIVES: Elite professional football players and staff are a unique group that might give insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany and thus can serve as a model for a geographical distribution and an estimation of undetected infections., METHODS: In this prospective cohort study seroprevalence was determined twice in May and June 2020 in players and staff from German Bundesliga. As screening assays a commercial ELISA (Euroimmun) and a CLIA (Roche) was used and an in-house neutralisation assay (NT) as gold standard. Participants were tested twice weekly using PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs., RESULTS: Seroprevalence (NT used as confirmation) in 2,164 samples from 1,184 players and staff was rather similar in May (23/1157 (1.99%)) and in June (21/1007 (2.09%)). All participants were PCR negative during the study period. Significant regional differences in seroprevalence were not observed. When comparing seroprevalence with the cumulative incidence of infections derived from the German notification system (subgroup matching to cohort; men, age: 20-69), IgG was found 8-10 times more frequently, pointing to a high rate of undetected infections. ELISA and CLIA correlated only moderately (Kappa 0.52)., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence with high quality diagnostic in Germany seemed to be around 2%. The number of undetected infections seems to be 8-10 times higher than notification data. Quality of antibody assays is rather variable, thus results should ideally be confirmed at least by a second assay to prove IgG positivity.

Prospective Sero-epidemiological Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in a German Secondary Care Hospital,Herzberg J.; Vollmer T.; Fischer B.; Becher H.; Becker A.-K.; Sahly H.; Honarpisheh H.; Guraya S.Y.; Strate T.; Knabbe C. ,"Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the pulmonary disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, which has challenged health care facilities worldwide. The sustainability of health care systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study aimed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. Method(s): Between March and June 2020, we used a combination of RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital based on repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPSs) and blood samples. Result(s): In total, 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPSs and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in three participants (0.34%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. Conclusion(s): Our study determined a low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. However, it could also indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees.

Las pruebas combinadas de IgM e IgG rapidas pueden tener un papel importante en la vigilancia de la COVID-19 y en su diagnostico, asi como en la evaluacion de la respuesta inmunologica y la verificacion de los avances hacia la inmunidad de rebano. Objetivo. Evaluar el desempeno de las pruebas rapidas de anticuerpos en la vigilancia ocupacional de la COVID-19 en un grupo de empresas colombianas. Materiales y metodos. Se usaron datos de la vigilancia ocupacional de empresas que hicieron pruebas serologicas periodicas a todo el personal desde finales de abril hasta comienzos de julio de 2020. Los trabajadores laboraban en grupos pequenos (""burbujas sociales"") para evitar brotes y optimizar la vigilancia. La sensibilidad se estimo como si el muestreo respondiera a un diseno prospectivo. Se describieron, asimismo, los cambios en las pruebas serologicas por medio de rondas periodicas. Resultados. Se obtuvieron datos de 4.740 trabajadores, de los cuales solo 23 eran sintomaticos. En ellos se evidenciaron cambios de IgM(-)/IgG(-) a IgM(+), y luego a IgM(+)/IgG(+) e IgG(+). La sensibilidad fue de 40,94 % para las IgM(+) y 47,95 % para las IgM(+)/IgG(+), lo que implica que se pudo detectar un poco menos de la mitad de los casos. Conclusion. Las pruebas rapidas de anticuerpos tienen un papel en el proceso diagnostico de la infeccion y deben evaluarse teniendo en cuenta el momento de la epidemia, el tipo de prueba comprada y las poblaciones de riesgo, dado que sus resultados dependen del numero de contagios y de casos.

Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin-G (IgG) within three weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled: 1) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; 2) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and 3) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology healthcare professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19., RESULTS: From March 30 to May 11, 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. Overall, 86 subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, while 60 (36.2%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19. Median time between symptom onset (for cases not confirmed by RT-PCR) or RT-PCR confirmation to serum antibody test was 17 days (interquartile range, 26).

We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission., METHODS: We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22-April 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test., RESULTS: Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4-106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2-42.5)., CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts. People with COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care to promptly self-isolate to prevent household transmission.

Compared to those with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated virus-neutralizing titers and antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Age and sex played lesser roles. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks after PCR confirmation. Spike RBD and S2 and neutralizing antibodies remained detectable through 5-7 months after onset, whereas alpha-N titers diminished. Testing 5,882 members of the local community revealed only 1 sample with seroreactivity to both RBD and S2 that lacked neutralizing antibodies. This fidelity could not be achieved with either RBD or S2 alone. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low-seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 exposures are challenging due to poor positive predictive values. Ripperger et al. show that the combinatorial use of spike receptor binding domain and S2 eliminates almost all false positives.

Method(s): Retrospective study of patients hospitalized with PCR+ for COVID-19 to assess the rate of cancer patients and describe clinical, pathological characteristics and evolution of their disease. In addition, a transversal study of seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Sars-Cov-2 is being carried out in patients undergoing active treatment. Immunophenotype analysis will be performed for patients with IgG/IgM+ test and a cohort of patients with negative test that will be used as controls. Result(s): 581 patients with mild to severe COVID-19 and PCR+ have been admitted at the Arnau Vilanova University Hospital in Valencia, Spain. A total of 18 patients had medical history of cancer (3%). 72% were male and median age was 76 years. Most frequent cancers were breast (16,7%), colon (16,7%) and bladder (16,7%). Fourteen had been treated for an early stage and were disease free at the time of the COVID-19 (83,3%). Three patients were on active systemic therapy: 2 chemotherapy (1 on neoadjuvant treatment for bladder cancer, 1 on chemo-radiotherapy for stage III NSCLC, and 1 with adjuvant Imatinib for GIST). One patient with advanced hepatocarcinoma was on palliative treatment. Most frequent symptoms were dyspnoea (66,7%), cough (66,7%), fever (66,7%), asthenia (44,4%) and diarrhea (16,7%). Four patients (22,2%) required Intensive Care and six (33,3%) died. Preliminary results of first 86 ambulatory patients on active treatment evaluated for seroprevalence against Sars-Cov-2 reveal a 0% of IgG or IgM antibodies. Conclusion(s): Rate of cancer patients admitted in hospital with COVID-19 infection was 3%. Cancer patients are more likely to be elderly and present comorbidities that increase COVID-19 infection risk, so whether cancer might be a risk factor itself remains controversial. We plan to recruit 300 patients on oncologic treatment, our preliminary results show a 0% seroprevalence. Final results will be communicated at ESMO meeting.

Retrospective single cohort study on patients with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic Healthcare Workers, enrolled from March to April 2020. Subjects had quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab and serological testing using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay. Some subjects underwent chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) after rapid test. The aim of the study was to analyse the proportion of those who developed a positive IgM/IgG response for SARS-CoV-2. The correspondence between the results from rapid testing and CLIA, when available, was evaluated. 97 subjects underwent qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 through nasal swab, which resulted positive in 40/43 (93.0%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of asymptomatic HCW, in no subjects with suspected COVID-19 (clinical and radiological findings) then excluded by repeated nasal swabs and alternative diagnosis (COVID-19-negative patients, CNPs), and in 6/6 (100%) of patients with confirmed diagnosis and negative follow-up nasal swabs (COVID-19-recovered patients, CRPs). IgM resulted positive in 8/43 (18.6%) of symptomatic patients and in 1/6 (16.7%) of CRPs. IgG resulted positive in 36/43 (83.7%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of HCW, and in 1/8 (12.5%) and 6/6 (100%) of CNPs and CRPs, respectively. A comparison between an IgG/IgM Rapid Test and a following CLIA test showed consistency in negative results in 25/28 of HCW and 8/8 of CNPs tested. Our preliminary data support the role of IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay as a point-of-care test that may complement molecular tests in the screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The test may gain particular relevance in shortening the time needed to refer patients to a COVID or non-COVID Hospital area and to achieve diagnosis in patients with persistently negative nasal swabs.",2020,/,The new microbiologica,43,4,,,,633320026,#54936,Canetti 2020,"",""

Performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in the occupational surveillance of COVID-19 in Colombian enterprises.,"Idrovo, Alvaro J; Moreno-Montoya, Jose; Pinzon-Florez, Carlos E","Introduction: Rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests can play an important role in the COVID-19 surveillance by supporting the diagnosis of infection, assessing the immune response, and verifying the progress towards herd immunity. Objective: To evaluate the performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in COVID-19 occupational surveillance in a group of Colombian enterprises. Materials and methods: We used the occupational surveillance data from companies that had performed periodic serological tests on all personnel from the end of April to the beginning of July, 2020. Workers were organized in small groups (""social bubbles"") to prevent outbreaks and optimize surveillance. The sensitivity was estimated as if the sampling had a prospective design. We describe here the changes in serological testing through periodic rounds. Results: Data were obtained from 4,740 workers, of whom only 23 were symptomatic showing changes from IgM(-)/IgG(-) to IgM(+) and then to IgM(+)/IgG(+) and IgG(+). The sensitivity was 40.94% for IgM(+) and 47.95% for IgM(+)/IgG(+). This implies that a little less than half of the cases can be detected. Conclusion: Antibody rapid tests have a role in the diagnostic process of infection and they must be evaluated taking into account the moment of the epidemic, the type of test purchased, and the populations at risk since their results depend on the number of infections and cases.

Twenty-two days later, epidemiological investigation and sampling were performed, to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 circulation and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Overall, 681 nasopharyngeal swabs and 667 blood samples were collected. Only one resident of the village resulted in being positive for RNA viral shedding, while 73 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall seroprevalence was 10.9%. The difference between the seroprevalence of infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was significant (chi2 = 14.50 p-value = 0.0001). Amongst the residents positive for antibodies, fatigue and/or muscle pain, fever and anosmia were the most experienced symptoms, whose most frequent onset was observed during the first two weeks of March.

Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike versus Nucleoprotein Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies,Fenwick C.; Croxatto A.; Coste A.T.; Pojer F.; Andre C.; Pellaton C.; Farina A.; Campos J.; Hacker D.; Lau K.; Bosch B.-J.; Gonseth Nussle S.; Bochud M.; D'Acremont V.; Trono D.; Greub G.; Pantaleo G. ,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to the Spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n=93) and in individuals enrolled in a post-infection seroprevalence population study (n=578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.Copyright © 2020 Fenwick et al.",2020,/,Journal of virology,,"(Fenwick, Andre, Pellaton, Farina, Campos) Service of Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland(Croxatto, Coste) Institute of Microbiology, Lausanne University Hospital a",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01828-20,633341792,#54540,Fenwick 2020,"",""

"SARS-COV-2 HERD IMMUNITY, INFECTIVE AND NAIVE INCIDENCE IN FERTILITY CLINICS AFTER PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN. A MULTICENTER STUDY",Foulk R.A.; Sakkas D.; Kayali R.; Valbuena D.; Simon C.; Cuzzi J. ,"Objective: COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March, 2020 and lockdown was imposed to a third of the world's population. Now, determining the transmission potential and immune status among sheltering in place asymptomatic patients and clinical staff resuming their activity is crucial. Here, we report herd immunity, infective, and naive incidence for SARS-CoV-2 after the lockdown period, among asymptomatic medical personnel and patients in two US ART centers located in states with different COVID19 incidences. Design(s): Prospective multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466644). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 339 asymptomatic individuals (personnel and patients) were analyzed from June 18 to July 30, 2020 in two ART centers reopening after lockdown following CDC safety guidelines. In Clinic A (Utah Fertility Center), located in a low prevalence State (312 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 154 individuals were analyzed. In clinic B (Boston IVF), in a high prevalence scenario (Massachusetts, 1,462 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 185 individuals were tested. Asymptomatic individuals attending or working in the indicated clinics were tested by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and for IgG quantification on blood samples (Abbott Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), following FDA-Emergency Use Authorization protocols. IRB approval was obtained from WIRB Protocol #20201490. Result(s): From 339 asymptomatic individuals tested, the percentage of non-informativity was 0 for RT-PCR and 0.6% (2 out of 339) for the IgG test. Only those individuals with informative results for both tests (n= 337) are presented. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): In the population investigated, our results suggest that the impact of the pandemic is far from reaching the level required to achieve herd immunity (i.e., 50% of a population). Therefore, transmission remains a risk since potential infectivity is present in 0.6% of the asymptomatic population tested. This figure was maintained despite their different geographical locations and the adherence to CDC guidelines of the IVF clinics involved. Interestingly, the two PCR+ individuals were IgG + suggesting virus persistence or reinfection that, if tested by serology alone, would be considered immune. These results together with the high incidence of naive individuals draws attention for the implementation of a consistent program of testing for COVID19 as a means of preventing reemerging outbreaks in our fertility centers.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Fertility and Sterility,114,3 Supplement,e539,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.069,2008033858,#44146,Foulk 2020,"",""

COVID-19 seropositivity and asymptomatic rates in healthcare workers are associated with job function and masking.,"Sims, Matthew D; Maine, Gabriel N; Childers, Karen Lins; Podolsky, Robert H; Voss, Daniel R; Berkiw-Scenna, Natalie; Oh, Joyce; Heinrich, Kevin E; Keil, Hans; Kennedy, Richard H; Homayouni, Ramin; BLAST COVID-19 Study Group","BACKGROUND: Although the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is higher for frontline healthcare workers, not all personnel have similar risks. Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment., METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay., RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive. Additionally, a large proportion of seropositive employees self-reported as asymptomatic.

The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. METHOD(S): We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. FINDINGS: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study.

COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence., Results: The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p < 0.0001).

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Health Care Workers in a New York City Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Analysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Venugopal U.; Jilani N.; Rabah S.; Shariff M.A.; Jawed M.; Batres A.M.; Abubacker M.; Menon S.; Pillai A.; Shabarek N.; Kasubhai M.; Dimitrov V.; Menon V. ,"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a greater number of infections cases, hospitalisations and mortality. Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at high-risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from a NYC public hospital. METHOD(S): Cross sectional study including serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. RESULT(S): A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge.Copyright © 2020.

Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1,019 women with a double test taken between Feb. 17 and Apr. 23, 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between Apr. 14 and May 21, 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving approximately 12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 18) versus negative (n = 994) (p = 0.62). There was no significant increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with positive antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, p = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection., WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significant increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning Covid-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies.

In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors., FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (96.8%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 5.9% (95% CI 4.9-7.1) for 1779 household contacts, 1.3% (0.9-1.9) for 2231 work contacts, and 1.3% (1.0-1.7) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 5.38 [95% CI 1.82-15.84]; p=0.0023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (7.86 [3.86-16.02]; p<0.0001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 3.92 [95% CI 2.07-7.40], p<0.0001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (2.67 [1.21-5.88]; p=0.015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (3.07 [1.55-6.08]; p=0.0013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission., INTERPRETATION: Targeted community measures should include physical distancing and minimising verbal interactions. Testing of all household contacts, including asymptomatic individuals, is warranted., FUNDING: Ministry of Health of Singapore, National Research Foundation of Singapore, and National Natural Science Foundation of China.

The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya was reported on March 12, 2020 and an overwhelming number of cases and deaths were expected but by July 31, 2020 there were only 20,636 cases and 341 deaths. However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community remains unknown. We determined the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among blood donors in Kenya in April-June 2020. Crude seroprevalence was 5.6% (174/3098).

Working at the front line, emergency department (ED) HCWs are uniquely at high risk. It is unknown if seropositivity in this population is similar to community levels or is substantially higher as a result of work-based exposure to infectious children who may demonstrate mild symptoms. Further, the experience of pediatric HCWs may be disparate from adult focused facilities because prior to implementation of social distancing, children presented for care at pediatric facilities in high numbers with mild illness. Many were evaluated in pediatric EDs which may have put pediatric HCWs at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic before universal personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization became standard practice. The milder nature of COVID-19 in children has also led some to believe that children are not affected, although the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refutes this notion. However, this belief and the lack of data may result in lax utilization to PPE in pediatric settings. Data describing seropositivity among pediatric HCWs is not yet available. Study Objective: Determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric HCWs. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing data from the baseline visit of a prospective cohort to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs at a large pediatric health care facility in April-May 2020. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and level of anxiety about COVID-19 was determined. Symptomatic or febrile HCWs were excluded. Metrics were analyzed overall and by HCW roles and tested for differences using chi-square estimates of independence. Prevalence of IgG antibodies were compared in ED vs. non-ED HCWs. Result(s): Of 300 HCWs enrolled from April 16-May 18, 2020, their mean age range is 41-50 years, 83% are female and 75% have no comorbidities. HCWs include 33% physicians, 25% nurses 10% respiratory therapists, 7% advance practice providers, and 25% other. Forty-seven percent were emergency department (ED) staff, 13% worked in pediatric intensive care, 40% elsewhere. Half of all HCWs had children in their home, 45% had traveled outside the state, and 47% reported an illness since January. Overall, 28% had a known COVID-19+ exposure. Most participants (90%) believed they were at high risk to develop COVID-19 as HCWs, and 70% reported high anxiety due to the pandemic. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in this cohort is 4.7%. Of the 14 HCWs with positive serology, only 3 (21%) had a history of any prior COVID-19 testing, all of which were positive; 43% (6/14) had no prior flu-like illness or symptoms. Eighty-six percent of antibody-positive HCWs were ED-based staff; SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 9% of ED HCWs enrolled compared to 1% in non-ED based HCWs, p=0.003. Conclusion(s): Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is low in pediatric HCWs living in a region with high COVID-19 activity. Most cases were found in HCWs from the pediatric ED, and nearly half were asymptomatic. ED-based pediatric HCWs may be uniquely at higher risk of exposure to children with COVID-19, and particularly may have been at higher risk of infection before awareness of the evolving pandemic; ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Annals of Emergency Medicine,76,4 Supplement,S124-S125,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.336,2008409942,#55578,Morris 2020,"",""

Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics., RESULTS: Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset., CONCLUSIONS: In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.",2020,/,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",,"9716844, qja",33354920966064,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033354920966064,33108976,#49699,McPherson 2020,Mairead Whelan (2020-12-14 15:29:14)(Select): can extract data on high exposure group; ,""

We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland in the spring of 2020 to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.AimOur objective was to determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Results All samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5-6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic.

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers.,"Noval Rivas, Magali; Ebinger, Joseph E; Wu, Min; Sun, Nancy; Braun, Jonathan; Sobhani, Kimia; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Cheng, Susan; Arditi, Moshe","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over one million deaths worldwide, thus there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs)., METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion., RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion., CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection., FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (U54 CA26059) and the Erika J.

The application of point of care serological testing can help determine past infection and assist healthcare workers assess patient risk. Method: An observational study of 114 subjects in North Suburban Chicago, Illinois, was performed using the Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). Patients' PCR test results and clinical symptoms were used to compare the seroconversion rate of this patient population with the surrounding community. Results: Excluding 1 aberrant result, there was 100% positive agreement (10) between PCR and antibody (IgG or IgM) test results. There were 7 patients who did not have a prior PCR test who were positive for IgG; 5 of the 7 had clinical symptoms consistent with possible exposure and 2 were asymptomatic. There was 1 person with a suspected exposure to an infected person who was IgM positive. Ninety-five asymptomatic patients were seronegative. The overall rate of 15.9% seroconversion (IgG or IgM) is consistent with other community-based testing results in the North Suburban Chicago, Illinois area.

It is also used for population-based seroepidemiological studies. The objective of the study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals and to compare two methods for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Materials and Methods: A total of 432 healthcare workers in Kaunas hospitals were enrolled in this study. Each participant filled a questionnaire including questions about their demographics, contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms, and whether they contacted their general practitioner, could not come to work, or had to be hospitalized. Capillary blood was used to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) a lateral flow immunoassay. Serum samples were used to test for specific IgG and IgA class immunoglobulins using semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: 24.77% of study participants had direct contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.

METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among US Navy personnel deployed on the USNS COMFORT to augment the inpatient health care capacity in New York City., Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on USNS COMFORT crewmembers returning to Norfolk, Virginia, following deployment. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire and provided a serum sample at Day 14 post-deployment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from testing of symptomatic crewmembers during deployment and Day 0 and Day 14 post-deployment screening swabs conducted on all crewmembers, per military order, were abstracted. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein immunoglobulin G antibody or PCR result., Results: Of the ship's total complement of 1200 crewmembers, 450 were enrolled: 432 (96.0%) completed the questionnaire and provided a serum sample. The median age of participants (interquartile range) was 30 (24-39) years, 50.8% were female, 58.6% were White, and 14.0% were Black; 80.1% had a clinical role during deployment. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 3.01% (13/432; 95% CI, 1.61%-5.09%). Twelve of 13 infections occurred in health care providers, and 8 of 13 were asymptomatic. The antibody profile of infected crewmembers varied by suspected timing of infection., Conclusions: We observed a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among USNS COMFORT crewmembers despite the inherent risk of a shipboard deployment to an area with high rates of community transmission.

It has created a devastating effect on humanity with social and economic depressions. Europe and America were the hardest hit continents. India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.",2021,,,,,,PPR280562,10.1101/2021.02.05.21251118,,#80621,Singh 2021,"",""
Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Pregnancy Outcomes: A Population-Based Study.,"Crovetto, Francesca; Crispi, Fatima; Llurba, Elisa; Pascal, Rosalia; Larroya, Marta; Trilla, Cristina; Camacho, Marta; Medina, Carmen; Dobano, Carlota; Gomez-Roig, Maria Dolores; Figueras, Francesc; Gratacos, Eduard; KidsCorona Pregnancy COVID-19 group","BACKGROUND: A population-based study to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy outcomes., METHODS: Prospective, population-based study including pregnant women consecutively attended at first/second trimester or at delivery at three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM/IgA) were measured in all participants and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was performed at delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative women: miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small-for-gestational age, neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome plus abnormal fetal growth, malformation, intrapartum fetal distress. Outcomes were also compared between positive symptomatic and positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 women., RESULTS: Of 2,225 pregnant women, 317 (14.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=314, 99.1%) and/or RT-PCR (n=36, 11.4%). Among positive women, 217 (68.5%) were asymptomatic, 93 (29.3%) had mild COVID-19 and 7 (2.2%) pneumonia, of which 3 required intensive care unit admission. In women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, the primary outcome occurred in 43 (13.6%) and 268 (14%), respectively [risk difference -0.4%, (95% CI: -4.1% to 4.1)]. As compared with non-infected women, women with symptomatic COVID-19 had increased rates of preterm delivery (7.2% vs. 16.9%, p=0.003) and intrapartum fetal distress (9.1% vs. 19.2%, p=0.004), while asymptomatic women had similar rates to non-infected cases. Among 143 fetuses from infected mothers, none had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA in cord blood., CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of pregnancy complications in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to non-infected women. However, symptomatic COVID-19 was associated with modest increases in preterm delivery and intrapartum fetal distress. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

The objectives of this study were to assess SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, individual exposure risk factors and compliance of HCWs to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). After the first nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak at JUH, mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We evaluated point seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays and issued a questionnaire to assess COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Antibody retesting was offered to participants with a divergent result of both immunoassays 5-10 weeks after the first test. Between 19th May and 19th June 2020, we analyzed 660 participants [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Among them, 212 participants (32.1%) had received a previous COVID-19 test. Four of them (1.9%) reported a positive test result. After recruitment, 18 participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Overall, 21 participants (3.2%) had any evidence of a past or current SARS CoV-2 infection. Among them, 13 (61.9%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (42.9%) did not report any clinical symptoms. COVID-19 exposure at home (adjusted OR (aOR) with 95% CI: 47.82 (5.49, 416.62)) was associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and exposure at work (aOR 0.48 (0.13, 1.70)) or with COVID-19 risk area according to the working place (aOR for intermediate-risk versus high-risk: 1.97 (0.42, 9.22), aOR for low-risk versus high-risk: 2.10 (0.40, 11.06); p=0.655). Reported compliance of HCWs to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). In conclusion, compared to administration staff, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE.

"Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the 2020 pandemic year in the population of the city of Tirana, Albania","Sulcebe, Genc; Ylli, Alban; Cenko, Fabian; Kurti-Prifti, Margarita","<h4>Introduction: </h4> While the identification of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been used to measure the hidden circulation of the COVID-19 in communities, there are few publications on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during both waves of 2020. This study provides original data about the change in proportion of individuals showing immune response to COVID-19 between beginning of July and end of December 2020. <h4>Methods:</h4> The study was conducted in two rounds, 27 June -3 July, and 21-28 December 2020, using two independently selected samples of individuals 20-70 years old. Study participants were randomly selected from lists of the inhabitants of the catchment communities of four primary health care centers in Tirana City. Serological testing was performed by an ELISA method which determines IgG class antibodies anti S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The validity of the method was tested in a sample of blood donors sera of 2018. <h4>Results:</h4> The proportion of individuals classified as seropositive during the first round, in early July was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.3% - 10.7%). The proportion rose sharply in the second round, by late December 2020, reaching 48.2% (95% CI: 44.8% - 51.7%). The same increasing pattern was observed in all studied categories. No statistical significance was found between men and women and between age categories. The prevalence of seropositive individuals was always significantly higher among those who reported symptoms and those who had done the molecular test. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The ratio of total infected cases over confirmed cases was estimated to be higher than 10 to 1 in Albania. The rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence observed in Tirana City may have been facilitated by a number of factors, including the very low infection exposure during the period March - May 2020, and the consecutive high susceptibility in population. Despite the observed high seroprevalence, one month after the study, COVID-19 incidence continued to increase in Tirana.",2021,,,,,,PPR286472,10.1101/2021.02.18.21251776,,#82323,Sulcebe 2021,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates.,"Kubiak, Jeffrey M; Murphy, Elisabeth A; Yee, Jim; Cagino, Kristen; Friedlander, Rachel L; Glynn, Shannon M; Matthews, Kathy C; Jurkiewicz, Magdalena; Sukhu, Ashley C; Zhao, Zhen; Prabhu, Malavika; Riley, Laura; Yang, Yawei J","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and their neonates represent two vulnerable populations highly susceptible to viral infections with an interdependent immune system. The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied., OBJECTIVES: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates., STUDY DESIGN: Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welch's two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welch's two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels., RESULTS: Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies. Copyright © 2021.

However, data on the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with kidney disease is limited, and the utility of an LFIA to test for antibodies in these patients has not been assessed., Study Design: Observational study., Setting & Participants: 60 patients (40 hemodialysis and 20 kidney transplant recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and 88 historic negative-control samples (collected before September 2019)., Test: A commercially available LFIA to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with infection confirmed by viral RT-PCR testing., Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG in dialysis patients and transplant recipients., Results: 56/58 (96.6%) patients (38/39 hemodialysis and 18/19 transplant recipients) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 5/7 (71.4%) patients who were negative on preliminary testing had detectable IgG when retested more than 21 days postdiagnosis. Median times to first and second tests after diagnosis were 17 (interquartile range, 15-20) and 35 (interquartile range, 30-39) days, respectively. Calculation of test characteristics gave sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI, 88.3%-99.4%) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 92.0-99.6%)., Limitations: Possible exposure to other beta-coronaviruses that may cross-react with the antigen used in the LFIA cannot be excluded., Conclusions: Symptomatic dialysis patients and transplant recipients commonly develop an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected using an LFIA. Used diligently, an LFIA could be used to help screen the dialysis populations or confirm exposure on a patient level, especially in facilities in which laboratory resources are limited.

Serology in COVID: Light the Lantern and Pave the Way to Unexplored...,Ramanathan S. ,"International Guidelines have voted for PCR as the Gold Standard in COVID diagnosis. Nasoparyngeal swab is the preferred specimen for PCR. It has a high probability of diagnosing early infection. But the diagnostic sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR decreases with increase in lapse between the infection and presentation to hospital. This might lead to dire consequences of labelling these patients as false negative, though such patients have been proved to be potentially infective since viral shedding occurs through other body fluids (stools) for long. COVID infection reveals that the IgM antibodies start to appear as early as 5th day of infection and switches over to IgA within 2-3 days.

How to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections early has become a global focus. Objective.-To explore the roles of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detection, nucleic acid tests, and computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design.-The clinical data of 389 individuals with close contacts, including in general characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 etiology, serum-specific IgM and IgG antibody detection and CT imaging results, were systematically analyzed. Results.-The present study showed that only 89 of 389 individuals with close contacts were positive after the first nucleic acid test, while 300 individuals were still negative after 2 nucleic acid tests. Among the 300 individuals, 75 did not have pneumonia, and the other 225 individuals had pulmonary imaging changes. A total of 143 individuals were eventually diagnosed as having asymptomatic infection through IgM antibody and IgG antibody detection. The sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate of IgM and IgG antibody detection were approximately 97.1% (347 of 357), 95.3% (204 of 214), and 4.67% (10 of 214), respectively. It also indicated that during approximately 2 weeks, most individuals were both IgM positive and IgG positive, accounting for 68.57% (72 of 105). During approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of IgM-positive and IgG-positive individuals decreased to 8.57% (9 of 105), and the proportion of IgM-negative and IgG-positive individuals increased to 76.19% (80 of 105).

Covid-19 infections in nmosd and mogad: A population based study,Capobianco M.; Comi G.; Sormani M.P.; Patti F. ,"Background: SARS-COV-2 pandemic poses an imminent threat to humanity and in particular in those people suffering chronic diseases. Immune-mediated disease, as NMOSD and MOGAD, could be at a higher risk of severe forms of COVID-19 both for the disease itself and for immunosuppressive treatments. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence and severity of COVID- 19 infection in the NMOSD/MOGAD population in Italy and evaluate possibily risk factors for disease outcomes. Method(s): The MS Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society has set up a proactive programme to provide information about COVID-19 in NMOSD/MOGAD patients, using a semistructured survey. Result(s): 569 NMOSD/MOGAD patients from 40 Italian MS Centres have been censored for COVID-19. 68% (387/569) of the patients were treated with rituximab, 16% (91/569) with azathioprine, 4.4% (25/569) with tocilizumab, 5.4% (31/569) with other therapies and 6.2% (35/569) were untreated or without information. 8/569 patients (1.4%) were diagnosed having confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19: positive rhino-pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were found in 4 out of 6 tested patients. At the time of data collection, 6 patients recovered, 1 was still hospitalised and, unfortunately, 1 died. Hospitalisation was required for 3 patients. 5/8 (68%) patients were treated with rituximab. There was no evidence of any difference of such a percentage with the one of the overall population (OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.18-3.31, p=0.74). COVID-19 infection was classified mild in 5, severe in 2 and critical in 1. The main experienced symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. 5/8 patients experienced CNS symptoms as headache (3), dizziness (1), anosmia (1) and delirium (1). Conclusion(s): 1) the prevalence of COVID-19 infection appears low in NMOSD/MOGAD patients (1.9%) with a mortality rate similar to that of the general italian population (12.5% vs 14.3%); 2) no other risk factors for severe course of COVID-19 than those already known emerge; 3) the baseline use of biologics, and in particular anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and apparently not with worse COVID-19 outcomes Even if preliminary, these findings suggest a cautious optimism in the care of these autoimmune conditions during the pandemic phase.",2020,/,Multiple Sclerosis Journal,26,3 SUPPL,92,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458520974938,634021163,#77252,Capobianco 2020,"",""

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children from a cohort of 2192 patients,Meyer M.; Rubsteck E.; Lehmann C.; Klein F.; Gruell H.; Hunseler C.; Weber L.T. ,"Background: As of 18 June 2020 a total of 187,764 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were reported in Germany and of these 6.9% were under the age of 19 years. There were initial indications that children are often asymptomatic and show a milder clinical course. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to gain information on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a pediatric cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 13 March and 18 June 2020 all children from whom a smear for SARS-CoV-2 was taken either to rule out an infection or as a suspected case were included. Data were collected on standardized patient record sheets. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Result(s): During the given period 2192 children were investigated and 37 patients tested positive (1.7%) for SARS-CoV-2. Of these 36/37 were suspected cases and 28/37 were symptomatic. The leading symptoms were dry cough, runny nose and fever and three children had to be hospitalized. None showed a difficult course of the disease. Among those tested 505 were patients at risk due to an underlying chronic disease, 3 of whom (0.6%) were tested positive with an asymptomatic or mild course. Conclusion(s): We can confirm the first data showing that children and adolescents often have an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of infection or disease.

Non-Congruent SARS-CoV-2 Waves in England,"Brookes, Anthony; Pollock, Allyson; Dorling, Danny","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Examination of the chronology, location and size of waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection across England could shed light on the inter-play between the 1 st and the 2 nd Waves. From mid-October onwards such an analysis becomes increasingly difficult due to the emergence of a new strain (VOC-202012/01) and in light of the differential implementation of lockdown measures and tiers. Therefore, we sought to examine trends and correlations in virus prevalence and covid-related deaths spanning the start of the UK pandemic in March 2020 through to early November 2020 – i.e., including the first growth period of the 2 nd Wave. We found striking regional relationships between the 1 st and the 2 nd Wave that are difficult to explain other than by involving some role for changing levels of immunity in the population affecting the progression of the pandemic.",2021,,,,,,PPR273677,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250440,,#77274,Brookes 2021,"",""
First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua.,"Huete-Perez, Jorge A; Cabezas-Robelo, Cristiana; Paiz-Medina, Lucia; Hernandez-Alvarez, Carlos A; Quant-Duran, Carlos; McKerrow, James H","The Nicaraguan COVID-19 situation is exceptional for Central America. The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis' effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects' COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",2021,/,PloS one,16,1,e0246084,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246084,33503071,#75692,Huete-Perez 2021,"",""
Clinical Features of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hemodialysis Patients.,"Pizarro-Sanchez, Maria Soledad; Avello, Alejandro; Mas-Fontao, Sebastian; Stock da Cunha, Teresa; Goma-Garces, Elena; Pereira, Monica; Ortiz, Alberto; Gonzalez-Parra, Emilio","BACKGROUND: CKD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized., OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients., METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed., RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common in hemodialysis patients, especially among patients with initial negative PCR that later seroconvert. Thus COVID-19 mortality in hemodialysis patients may be lower than previously estimated based on PCR tests alone. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state., Methods: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands., Results: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder., Conclusion: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients was shown. More research needs to be conducted to confirm these observations and guidelines regarding (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs in COVID-19 positive immunocompromised patients should be developed.

Extremely low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Israeli hospitals: a cross-sectional study,"Temkin, E.; Healthcare Worker, Covid-Surveil","Objectives: We aimed to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among clinical staff in designated COVID-19 units versus that among staff in similar units with no known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) in eight Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. Results: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unitdtested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. Conclusions: The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCWs, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCWs.

"SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in asymptomatic frontline health workers in Ibadan, Nigeria",Olayanju O.; Bamidele O.; Edem F.; Eseile B.; Amoo A.; Nwaokenye J.; Udeh C.; Oluwole G.; Odok G.; Awah N. ,"Global health has been thrown into turmoil by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused devastating morbidity and unprecedented loss of life in almost all continents of the world. It was predicted that the magnitude of the pandemic in Africa will be high because of poor health structure and intensely poor living condition, but that has not happened, surprisingly. It was hypothesized that the youthful population and a vastly primed immune system were protective, and many people may have been exposed without coming down with the severe disease. Most of them would have presented in hospitals with other medical conditions and possibly transmit COVID-19 to health workers inadvertently. This study is designed to measure serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in health workers as a marker of latent exposure. Asymptomatic frontline health workers were randomly selected from the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria; venous blood samples were obtained from them, and the serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was determined using ELISA techniques. A proportion of participants with seropositivity were obtained, and factors associated with seropositivity were determined. A total of 133 participants were recruited for this study, and 60 (45.1%) of them were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the seropositive participants were doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory scientists and technicians, and nonmedical staff. Obstetrics, gynecology, and emergency departments had higher odds of seropositivity. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is very high among frontline health workers, though asymptomatic.

The samples had been used for routine admission tests in six healthcare institutions in Daegu. Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed and the cutoff index (COI) was calculated for quantitative analysis. The patients&rsquo; information was reviewed to evaluate the relationship between antibody positivity and clinical characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate was 85% and the average COI was 24&middot;3. The positivity rate and COI increased with time elapsed since symptom onset. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks after symptom onset at a high COI. There was a significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between patients with and without symptoms, but not according to sex or disease course. The descending COI pattern at weeks 1 to 5 after symptom onset was significantly more frequent in patients who died than in those who recovered. There was a correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity and the cycle threshold value of RdRP by real-time RT-PCR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks at a high COI in patients with COVID-19. A decreasing COI pattern up to fifth week may be associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As new treatments and vaccines are introduced, it is important to monitor continuously the usefulness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: Research Program funded by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020ER551000).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Medicity Daegu Joint (approval no.

The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 (positive PCR or antibody test) and all COVID-19 cases (confirmed and suspected) from the start of the pandemic was compared with the population estimates for Barcelona., RESULTS: A total of 407 patients (69.5%) completed the survey. Most of the responders (67%) were female. The responders had a median age of 48 years (range 19-86), relapsing-remitting disease (84%), at least 1 comorbidity (45%), and were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT; 74.7%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 5 patients (1.2%) and suspected in 46 (11.3%). The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases was similar to that of the general population but was almost 2-fold higher when all cases were considered (p < 0.001). Six patients (11.7%) were hospitalized, of which 5 had good recovery and 1 died. Hospitalized patients were more frequently male, had diabetes and had progressive forms of MS (p < 0.05). DMT was not associated with the risk of infection or the outcome., CONCLUSIONS: In the studied MS cohort, the incidence of COVID-19 was higher than that of the general population; however, most patients did not require hospitalization and had a good outcome despite the frequent presence of comorbidities and treatment with DMT.

COVID-19 prevalence and predictors in United States adults during peak stay-at-home orders.,"Morlock, Robert; Morlock, Amy; Downen, Martha; Shah, Sonali N","BACKGROUND: Early recognition of COVID-19 cases is essential for effective public health measures aimed at isolation of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample., METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative. Severe dry cough, new loss of taste or smell, trouble waking up, living with someone experiencing symptoms, recent international travel, respiratory issues, and reporting ethnicity of Black or African American were predictive of testing positive., CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 using community-level self-reported data across the US during the peak of most stay at home' orders. Self-reported symptoms and risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the clinical profile emerging for COVID-19. In the absence of widespread testing, this study demonstrates the utility of a representative US community-based sample to provide direct-reported symptoms and outcomes to quickly identify high-risk individuals who are likely to test positive and should consider taking greater precautions.",2021,/,PloS one,16,1,e0245586,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245586,33481900,#75585,Morlock 2021,"",""

"Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China",Xu R.; Huang J.; Duan C.; Liao Q.; Shan Z.; Wang M.; Rong X.; Li C.; Fu Y.; Wang H. ,"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,3,1743-1747,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26445,2006835762,#78279,Xu 2021,"",""
High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control,"Toth, Damon J.A.; Beams, Alexander; Keegan, Lindsay; Zhang, Yue; Greene, Tom; Orleans, Brian; Seegert, Nathan; Looney, Adam; Alder, Stephen; Samore, Matthew","<h4>Background: </h4> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy. Methods. We compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior PCR test reporting from members of more than 9000 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population. Results. We estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.38% (95% CI 0.30% - 0.48%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 35% (26% - 47%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 15% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.40 (0.32 - 0.51) to avoid continued growth of the Utah epidemic. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.",2021,,,,,,PPR276377,10.1101/2021.01.29.20248797,,#77378,Toth 2021,"",""

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of health care workers,Rivas M.N.; Ebinger J.E.; Wu M.; Sun N.; Braun J.; Sobhani K.; van Eyk J.E.; Cheng S.; Arditi M. ,"BACKGROUND. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The antituberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrates nonspecific, protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a longitudinal, retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, which included information on BCG vaccination status and preexisting demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multisite Los Angeles health care organization. We used multivariate analysis to determine whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS. Of the 6201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination, whereas 68.9% had not received BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as the incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were markedly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared with those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that a history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal, or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS. A history of BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease in the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a lower number of participants who self-reported experiencing COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized, prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm whether BCG vaccination can confer a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2021, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",2021,/,Journal of Clinical Investigation,131,2,e145157,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI145157,2010814494,#76890,Rivas 2021,"",""

Following infection, ICHD patients frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICHD patients. <h4>Methods</h4> Three hundred and fifty-six ICHD patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies. Patients who became seronegative at 6 months were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. <h4>Results</h4> One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at Time 0, of which 127 (98.4%) also had detectable anti-RBD. At 6 months, of 111 patients tested, 71(64.0%) and 97 (87.4%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive respectively, p<0.001. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels reduced significantly after 6 months. Ten patients who were anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive at Time 0, had no detectable antibody at 6 months; of which 8 were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at 6 months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following 6 months. <h4>Conclusions</h4> ICHD patients mount durable immune responses 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with <3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity. These immune responses are associated with a reduced risk of subsequent reinfection. <h4>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h4> Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. Patients with ESKD receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. What is not known is how durable the serological responses in ESKD patients are or whether evidence of prior immune responses protect patients from reinfection. In this study of 356 ICHD patients, at 6 months following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, fewer than 3% of patients lacked evidence of either humoral or cellular immunity. Furthermore, patients with serological evidence of infection had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with subsequent infection or ‘reinfection’, suggesting functional immune protection.",2021,,,,,,PPR273752,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249865,,#77283,Clarke 2021,"",""

It was found that seropositive subjects were older and that diabetes was more prevalent in them (p <0.01). No differences were identified in the blood type nor vaccination against influenza between seronegative and seropositive cases. Cough, respiratory distress, muscle pain, joint pain, and anosmia were more prevalent in seropositive cases than in those seronegative (p<0.0001). The IgM or IgM+IgG seropositive cases presented anosmia more frequently than those with only IgG antibodies (p<0.05). The dietary patterns and individual food intake habits were similar in both groups, except for the most consumed type of fat (p = 0.006). Seronegative cases showed to consume monounsaturated fats more frequently than other types of fats, whereas seropositive subjects have more regular consumption of polyunsaturated fats. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> This study confirms the association between being anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive with older age and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it suggests muscle and joint pain could also be considered major criteria for discriminating patients with suspected COVID-19 seropositivity. Moreover, the results suggested polyunsaturated fats as a possible new risk factor associated with COVID-19, and anosmia as a marker of active disease.

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population-based IFR., METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood 6 April to 3 May were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas, and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. Seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., RESULTS: The first 20 640 blood donors were tested, and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, .8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers, a combined IFR in patients <70 years is estimated at 89 per 100 000 (95% CI, 72-211) infections., CONCLUSIONS: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely severalfold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.

"Characterization of SARS-COV-2 antibody titers in over 16,000 blood and plasma donations",Gannett M.; Prichard A.; Yordanov B.; Gammon R. ,"Background: Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are believed to have a Spike protein specificity, specifically to the Receptor Binding Domain of Subunit 1 (S1- RBD). The correlation between donor demographics and antibody titers is not presently known. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference in neutralizing antibody titers based on donor demographics to include: age, race, and gender. Method(s): Blood donors were screened utilizing a commercial qualitative assay and subsequently reflexed to a quantitative laboratory developed test (LDT) utilizing a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD protein. The LDT is a total immunoglobulin kinetic-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA). The k-ELISA utilized a standard curve created from a pool of 100 CCP donors to calculate a titer by testing a single dilution of each specimen. Testing was performed on donations collected from 30 March 2020 to 29 September 2020. The results were grouped by age, race, and gender for evaluation. The one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett comparison was used to evaluate differences of the mean of each group compared to the mean of all donors. Result(s): There were 16,153 donations tested. The mean titer of all donations was 1208. Males (n. 7,989) had a statistically significantly higher mean titer of 1347 (P < 0.0001), whereas Females (n.8,156) had a lower mean titer of 1,072 (P < 0.0001), there were 8 donors who did not provide a gender and were excluded from evaluation in the gender category. Hispanic donors (n. 3,838) had statistically higher mean titer of 1,373 (P < 0.0001) and Caucasian donors (n.10,900) had a lower mean titer of 1,149 (p<0.0192), whereas African American donors (n.746) did not have a statistically significant mean titer of 1,193 (P = 0.9988). Donors in the age groups of 16-19, 20-29, and 30-39 had significantly (P <= 0.0003) lower mean titers of 869, 828, and 904 respectively. Donors between the age of 40-49 did not have a significantly different mean titer of 1,202 (P = 0.9998). Lastly, donors in the age groups of 50-59, 60-69, and >=70 had mean titers of 1,433, 1,623, and 1,708 respectively, all which were statistically higher than the overall population (P < 0.0001). Summary/Conclusions: There was no difference from the mean titer for African American donors or donors 40-49 years of age. Donors that are Caucasian, under the age of 40, or female were more likely to have a lower titer. Hispanics, donors over the age of 50, or males were more likely to have higher titers.",2020,/,Vox Sanguinis,115,SUPPL 1,72,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.13031,633985931,#76944,Gannett 2020,"",""

Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million). We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n = 2979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests. Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5-12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.22-1.78) and household income < $50,000 (vs. > $100,000: PR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79). Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~ 12 percent.

SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors of Catalonia (Spain): Before and after the first wave,Piron M.; Sauleda S.; Bes M.; Martinez A.; Ciruela P.; Basile L.; Puig L.; Jane M. ,"Background: In March 16 2020, total confinement of the Spanish population was implemented in order to mitigate expansion of SARS-CoV-2. By May 15, cumulative incidence (CI) of confirmed cases in Spain were higher than 500 per 100,000. In Catalonia, CI was 756 per 100,000, with uneven distribution among the four provinces: 321 in Tarragona, 451 Lleida, 660 in Girona, and 1042 in Barcelona, two-fold the mean Spanish CI. However, these figures probably underestimated the real exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among general population. Blood donors (BD) have been in the past a valuable sentinel population to assess prevalence and change in trends of emerging infectious diseases in asymptomatic individuals. Archive samples from blood donations provide at present the opportunity to monitor evolution of and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthy individuals. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to assess exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Catalan blood donors before and after the first wave Methods: Seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in two periods: February 29 to March 9 2020 (N = 6,930), and May 16 to June 17 2020 (N = 6,829). Blood donations samples were analyzed for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies (Wantai ELISA test: all samples in the first period, 2,964 samples in the second period) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Euroimmun ELISA test: 3,855 samples of the second period). Samples positive for total antibodies in the first period were also tested for the presence of IgM (Wantai ELISA test). Demographic data (age, gender, postal code of residence) were recorded before anonymization and testing. This study was approved by the Vall d'Hebron Hospital IRB. Result(s): BD included in the two periods were comparable in age (44+/-13 years), gender (50.6% males) and represented the four provinces in Catalonia proportionally to the number of inhabitants: Barcelona 66.8% samples in March and 56.6 in May- June; Girona 12.6% and 17.3%; Lleida 11.3% and 14.5%; Tarragona 9.2% and 11.6%, in each period respectively. The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in March was 0.25% (17/6,930; S/co value 4.1+/-4.0), equally distributed among provinces (0.22% Barcelona, 0.34% Girona, 0.31% Lleida, 0.26% Tarragona). Five of the 17 samples were also IgM positive (3 in Barcelona, 1 in Girona, 1 in Lleida), thus showing true exposure to SARS-CoV-2. False positive reactivity cannot be ruled out in the 12 IgM negative samples. Conversely, in the second period of the study (May-June), the overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (379/6,829; CI95% 5.0% > 6.1%), with similar results obtained with Wantai total antibodies (5.77%, CI95% 4.9% > 6.6%; S/Co 11.6+/-5.4) and Euroimmun IgG (5.41%, CI95% 4.7% > 6.15; S/ Co 4.2+/-2.4). No differences were found in age or gender between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative BD (42+/-13 vs 43+/-13 years; 50% vs 51% males, respectively). As per the four provinces, the SARS-CoV-2 exposure was distributed unequally: 7.69% Barcelona, 3.47% Girona, 2.65% Lleida, 2.02% Tarragona. The exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Barcelona was significantly higher than in the rest of the provinces (P < 0.001). Summary/Conclusions: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among BD after the first wave was 5.6%, showing that the number of asymptomatic cases or not diagnosed inflections was at least 7-fold higher than the reported confirmed CI. Exposure found in the four Catalan provinces was proportional to the respective CI.

The aim of this single-centre prospective study was to evaluate the trend of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCWs working at the primary referral centre for infectious diseases and bioemergencies (eg, COVID-19) in Northern Italy and investigate the factors associated with seroconversion., METHODS: Six hundred and seventy-nine HCW volunteers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies three times between 4 March and 27 May 2020 and completed a questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and personal protective equipment (PPE) training and confidence at each time., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 3/679 to 26/608 (adjusted prevalence: 0.5%, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.7% and 5.4%, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.9, respectively) between the first two time points and then stabilised, in line with the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic in Milan. From the first time point, 61.6% of the HCWs had received training in the use of PPE and 17 (61.5%) of those who proved to be seropositive reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Contacts with ill relatives or friends and self-reported symptoms were independently associated with an increased likelihood of seroconversion (p<0.0001 for both), whereas there was no significant association with professional exposure., CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the HCWs at our COVID-19 referral hospital was low at the time of the peak of the epidemic. The seroconversions were mainly attributable to extrahospital contacts, probably because the hospital readily adopted effective infection control measures. The relatively high number of asymptomatic seropositive HCWs highlights the need to promptly identify and isolate potentially infectious HCWs. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Validation of COVID-19 serologic tests and large scale screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers,Mullins K.E.; Merrill V.; Ward M.; King B.; Rock P.; Caswell M.; Ahlman M.; Harris A.D.; Christenson R. ,"Objectives: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and Methods: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. Result(s): Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. Conclusion(s): Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence.

Result(s): Among the 1,555 participating firefighters/paramedics, 8.5% reported receipt of the seasonal flu vaccine, and 4.1% tested SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. None of the antibody-positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to those who tested negative (0.0% vs. 8.5%; p=0.012). After controlling for potential confounders, firefighters/paramedics who were Hispanic/Latino vs non-Hispanic/Latino (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval=0.20-0.55]), former smokers vs never smokers (AOR:0.47 [0.24-0.93]), and had one or more chronic conditions vs no chronic diseases(AOR:0.33 [0.15-0.75]) were significantly less likely to report seasonal influenza vaccine receipt. Conclusion(s): Influenza vaccination rates were very low among frontline firefighters/paramedics in a large Florida fire department.

High seroprevalence but short-lived immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Paris,Anna F.; Goyard S.; Lalanne A.I.; Nevo F.; Gransagne M.; Souque P.; Louis D.; Gillon V.; Turbiez I.; Bidard F.-C.; Gobillion A.; Savignoni A.; Guillot-Delost M.; Dejardin F.; Dufour E.; Petres S.; Richard-Le Goff O.; Choucha Z.; Helynck O.; Janin Y.L.; Escriou N.; Charneau P.; Perez F.; Rose T.; Lantz O. ,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in March/April 2020 in France, the prevalence of infection is barely known. Using high-throughput methods, we assessed herein the serological response against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of 1847 participants working in three sites of an institution in Paris conurbation. In May-July 2020, 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, and 9.5% (95% CI: 8.2-11.0) were neutralizer in pseudo-typed virus assays. The prevalence of seroconversion was 11.6% (95% CI: 10.2-13.2) when considering positivity in at least one assay. In 5% of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative, suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may have reached 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling, anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and neutralization activity in pseudo-virus assay declined by 31%, 17%, and 53%, resulting thus in half-life of 35, 87, and 28 days, respectively. The population studied is representative of active workers in Paris.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 prevalence in 1170 asymptomatic Norwegian conscripts.,"Borud, Einar Kristian; Nakstad, Espen Rostrup; Haberg, Siri Eldevik; Lind, Andreas; Fadum, Elin Anita; Taxt, Arne Michael; Steens, Anneke; Gjein, Gaute Eriksen; Sunde, Magne Wiken; Iversen, Petter; Svanevik, Marius; Ahmad, Babar Mushtaq; Waldow, Thomas; Norheim, Arne Johan","Background: Accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different population groups are important for the health authorities. In Norway, public infection control measures have successfully curbed the pandemic. However, military training and service are incompatible with these measures; therefore extended infection control measures were implemented in the Norwegian Armed Forces. We aimed to describe these measures, discuss their value, and investigate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prevalence and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in antibody titer levels over the 6-week military training period in a young, asymptomatic population of conscripts., Methods: In April 2020, 1170 healthy conscripts (median age 20 years) enrolled in military training. Extended infection control measures included a pre-enrollment telephone interview, self-imposed quarantine, questionnaires, and serial SARS-CoV-2 testing. At enrollment, questionnaires were used to collect information on symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody testing was conducted. Serial SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology testing were used to estimate the prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and monitor titer levels at enrollment, and 3 and 6 weeks thereafter., Results: At enrollment, only 0.2% of conscripts were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, and seroprevalence was 0.6%. Serological titer levels increased nearly 5-fold over the 6-week observation period. Eighteen conscripts reported mild respiratory symptoms during the 2 weeks prior to enrollment (all were PCR-negative; one was serology-positive), whereas 17 conscripts reported respiratory symptoms and nine had fever at enrollment (all were PCR- and serology-negative)., Conclusions: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was less than 1% in our sample of healthy Norwegian conscripts. Testing of asymptomatic conscripts seems of no value in times of low COVID-19 prevalence. SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer levels increased substantially over time in conscripts with mild symptoms.

"Seroepidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in 41 municipalities in Honduras wth no reports of active cases, COVID-19, June 16-23, 2020","Nunez, M. R. M.; Lara, J. A.; Pleitez, S. A.; Ramirez, G. A.","Introduction: In Honduras on March 12, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 was reported. From that moment on, a series of measures were adopted to slow down contact throughout the country. By June 2020, cases are reported across the whole country. With the objective of identifying the presence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2, characterizing and identifying suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 in the population, the present study was carried out. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out, using a quantitative and qualitative approach, using the LQAS sampling method. The study population was the inhabitants of the identified municipalities, with no current circulation data for SARS-CoV-2 or the municipalities whose last confirmed case was 21 days ago. The data was collected through an electronic survey, it was possible to apply rapid antibody detection tests (IgG and IgM). Results: 792 people from 41 municipalities of the country were surveyed and tested. Positivity of contact was found in 6.2% (49/792). Of these, 55.1% (27/49) are men. 61.2% (30/49) are between 20 and 49 years old.The clinical symptoms found were fever, decreased appetite, respiratory distress, and loss of taste and smell, the 49.2% (32/49) without symptoms.

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by Reverse transcription-PCR and serology in the Paris area: A cross-sectional study,Cohen R.; Jung C.; Ouldali N.; Sellam A.; Batard C.; Cahn-Sellem F.; Elbez A.; Wollner A.; Romain O.; Corrard F.; Aberrane S.; Soismier N.; Creidy R.; Smati-Lafarge M.; Launay O.; Bechet S.; Varon E.; Levy C. ,"Background Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are potentially less contagious than adults. To examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we combined both Reverse transcription-PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France, Paris, during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods From 14 April 2020 to 12 May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, prospective, multicentre study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory paediatricians. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse transcription-PCR and a microsample of blood for micromethod serology. Results Among the 605 children, 322 (53.2%) were asymptomatic and 283 (46.8%) were symptomatic. Reverse transcription-PCR and serology results were positive for 11 (1.8%) and 65 (10.7%) children, respectively, with no significant difference between asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic children. Only three children were Reverse transcription-PCR-positive without any antibody response detected. The frequency of Reverse transcription-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly higher for children with positive than negative serology results (12.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). Contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 increased the odds of Reverse transcription-PCR positivity (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 40.7) and serology positivity (OR 15.1, 95% CI 6.6 to 34.6). Conclusion In an area heavily affected by COVID-19, after the peak of the first epidemic wave and during the lockdown, the rate of children with Reverse transcription-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity was very low (1.8%), but that of serology positivity was higher (10.7%). Most children with positive Reverse transcription-PCR results also had positive serology results.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck Emergency and Non-Emergency Healthcare Workers.,"Laursen, Jannie; Petersen, Janne; Didriksen, Maria; Iversen, Kasper; Ullum, Henrik","BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse, especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers. It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence., METHODS: This research involved a bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from 22 June 2020 until 10 August 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied., RESULTS: Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group., CONCLUSION: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.",2021,/,International journal of environmental research and public health,18,3,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030923,33494409,#75592,Laursen 2021,"",""

The objective of this cross-sectional study in May-July 2020 was to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and virus RNA in schoolchildren, consistent with previous infection by contact tracing., METHODS: School authorities approached parents for voluntary participation. Interested families were contacted by the study team. A nasal and oropharyngeal swab, a blood sample, and a questionnaire were employed. Primary endpoint was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR- and antibody-positive children. Antibody-positivity was assessed by a highly-sensitive first-line ELISA, and a neutralization assay and two other immunoassays as confirmatory assays., RESULTS: Of 2069 children (median age 13 years, IQR 10-15) 2 cases (0.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 26 cases (1.3%) tested positive for specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies exhibited detectable virus-neutralizing activity in 92% (24 of 26 samples). Seropositivity was associated with a history of mild clinical symptoms in 14 children (53.8%), while 12 children (46.2%) remained asymptomatic. Among 13 seropositive children being tested concomitantly with their siblings, only one pair of siblings was seropositive. Contact tracing revealed adult family members and school teachers as potential index cases., CONCLUSION: In school children, the infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 is low and associated with a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. Virus spreading seemed to occur more likely in intergenerational contacts than among siblings in the same household.

SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity among Dental Staff and the Role of Aspirating Systems.,"Sarapultseva, M; Hu, D; Sarapultsev, A","INTRODUCTION: Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of infection owing to occupational exposure to patients and virus-contaminated surfaces., OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed to reveal and compare the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patient-facing HCWs across 3 dental clinics equipped with different types of aspirating systems., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 157 HCWs (43.58 +/- 1.66 y) from 3 dental clinics in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation) who reported to work during the coronavirus disease pandemic. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. The V6000 aspirating system with a vacuum controller (dry or semidry mode) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was used at clinics A and B, and the aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the atmosphere. The VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters was used at clinic C. The aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the operatories. All dental clinics followed the same recommendations for dental patient management and types of personal protective equipment used., RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (19 HCWs) over a 5-mo follow-up (May to August 2020). The prevalence of infection was unaffected by sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (+) was significantly higher at clinic C (equipped with an aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters) than at other clinics., CONCLUSION: The type of aspirating system used and the presence of HEPA filters could affect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across dental clinics. Therefore, we recommend the use of aspirating systems installed with HEPA filters, which evacuate and dissipate aerosols into specialized areas., KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This report confirms that dentists, being patient-facing HCWs, are at a high risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies gaps in the protection of patients and staff in dental settings.",2021,/,JDR clinical and translational research,,101684997,2380084421993099,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2380084421993099,33543682,#77851,Sarapultseva 2021,"",""

The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital. Aim: To estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown Methodology: A cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020 Results: Jubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 423 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID 19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23 to 11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.

This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. Method(s): A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. Result(s): Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4 +/- 0.9, mean +/- SD), highly symptomatic (7.5 +/- 1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0 +/- 1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3 +/- 8.3 versus 17.3 +/- 9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. Conclusion(s): Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms. Regular testing in congregant settings of those over age 60 years may help mitigate asymptomatic spread.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",2021,/,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,,"(Feehan, Fort, Velasco, Burton, Garcia-Diaz, Price-Haywood, Pevey, Seoane) Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA, United States(Feehan, Garcia-Diaz, Price-Haywood, Seoane) University of Queensland, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA, United Sta",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.12.029,2010804517,#76362,Feehan 2021,"",""

Evaluating the longitudinal effectiveness of preventive measures against COVID-19 and seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in cancer outpatients and healthcare workers.,"Fong, Dominic; San Nicolo, Katja Olga; Alber, Monika; Mitterer, Manfred","BACKGROUND: It has been assumed that cancer patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy, are at increased risk for infection and severe illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. After the first alert message from the local healthcare service, a series of drastic measures were taken at our outpatient clinic to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: In this retrospective study, all consecutive cancer outpatients completed a baseline SARS-CoV-2 test via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 15 March to 26 May 2020. In the later phase, after the peak of the pandemic, patients as well as healthcare workers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies., RESULTS: Between 15 March and 26 May 2020, 0.78% (N= 5/640) cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Between 22 June and 17 July 2020, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in 2 out of 250 (0.8%) cancer patients and 2 out of 36 (5.5%) healthcare workers. In only 1 out of 4 cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, could SARS-CoV-2 antibodies be detected., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the majority of our patients and healthcare workers had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and rapidly implemented measures were effective.

Follow-up exposure and clinical data were collected using an online survey. SARS-CoV-2 testing was done using rapid IgM and IgG serological tests; RT-PCR was done for those with positive serology. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios(HR) of seroconversion., RESULTS: Of the 3870/4040(95.8%) HCWs who tested negative for IgM, IgG, and PCR at baseline, 2282(59.0%) returned for follow-up. Seroconversion incidence (positive IgM and/or IgG) was 100/2282(4.4%,95%:CI:3.6-5.3),mostly asymptomatic(64/100,64.0%), with a daily hazard = 0.21%(95%-CI:0.17-0.25)/48746 person-days of follow-up. Seroconversion was 4.0%(64/1596;95%CI:3.1-5.1) among asymptomatic and 5.3%(36/686;95%CI:3.7-7.2) among symptomatic HCWs. Seroconversion was independently associated with older age(HR:2.71,95%CI:1.31-5.58); lower education(HR:3.89,95%CI:1.89-8.00); contact with a confirmed case>15 minutes(HR:2.20,95%CI:1.18-4.10); chronic kidney disease(HR:4.42,95%CI:1.03-18.96); pregnancy(HR:3.5,95%CI:1.05-11.85); change/loss of smell(HR:3.17,95%CI:1.48-6.78); and negatively associated with contact at workplace(HR:0.48,95%CI:0.28-0.82)., CONCLUSIONS: Most seroconversions were asymptomatic, emphasizing the need for regular universal testing. Seropositivity was three-fold that observed at baseline. Cumulative infections increased nationally by a similar rate, suggesting that HCWs' infections reflect community not nosocomial transmission during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China., Methods: We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative., Findings: Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (53.0%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (50.1%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (74.9%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (4.5%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 4.1% (95% CI 2.9-5.7), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (0.0% [95% CI 0.0-1.1]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 8.0 times (95% CI 5.3-12.7) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection., Interpretation: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China., Funding: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Special Foundation of Science and Technology Innovation Strategy of Guangdong Province, and Key Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission.

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have not been well described. We describe the prevalence of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital in South India. <h4>Methods:</h4> To determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS. <h4>Results:</h4> Of 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month - 17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p=0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIM-TS (54.8 AU/mL). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary children's hospital.

Large-scale IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 serological screening among healthcare workers with a low infection prevalence based on nasopharyngeal swab tests in an Italian university hospital: perspectives for public health.,"Vimercati, Luigi; Stefanizzi, Pasquale; De Maria, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Cavone, Domenica; Quarato, Marco; Gesualdo, Loreto; Lopalco, Pier Luigi; Migliore, Giovanni; Sponselli, Stefania; Graziano, Giusi; Vittoria Larocca, Angela Maria; Tafuri, Silvio","BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2infection given their specific tasks. The IgG-IgM serological assay has demonstrated good accuracy in early detection in symptomatic patients, but its role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is uncertain. The aim of our study was to assess IgM and IgG prevalence in sera in a large cohort of HCWs previously subjected to Nasopharyngeal swab test (NST) after accurate risk assessment due to positive COVID-19 patient exposure during an observation period of 90 days., METHODS: 2407 asymptomatic HCWs that had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the period between April 8th and June 7th were screened with NST based on the RT-PCR method. In parallel, they underwent large-scale chemiluminescence immunoassays involving IgM-IgG serological screening to determine actual viral spread in the same cohort., RESULTS: During the 90-day observation period, 18 workers (0.75%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the NST, whereas the positivity rates for IgM and IgG were 11.51% and 2.37%, respectively (277 workers). Despite high specificity, serological tests were inadequate for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with previous positive NST results (IgM and IgG sensitivities of 27.78% and 50.00%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a widespread low viral load of SARS-CoV-2 among hospital workers. However, serological screening showed very low sensitivity with respect to NST in identifying infected workers, and negative IgG and IgM results should not exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. IgG-IgM chemiluminescence immunoassays could increase the diagnosis of COVID-19 only in association with NST, and this association is considered helpful for decision-making regarding returning to work.

Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"Herrington, David; =The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership Study Group","<h4>Background: </h4> Estimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies.

Do COVID-19 Antibodies Provide Long-Term Protection?,"Ansari, S. F.; Memon, M.; Kumar, R.; Memon, S.; Memon, M. K.","Introduction: Post severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, an immune response is generated among healthy, immunocompetent individuals with immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) antibodies. IgM rises earlier than IgG, indicating a recent infection. However, a detailed analysis is required to assess long-term immune reactions induced by antibodies. Method and Materials: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from June 2020 to October 2020 where serum samples were collected from patients. The samples were obtained by phlebotomy for antibody testing. All the reactive patients were followed up after 60 days of initial testing. Results: A total of 728 patients participated in the study, of which 79 (10.8%) were seropositive at baseline. Seventy-two (91.1%) participants came back for follow-up after 60 days (two months) and were included in the final analysis. Among the 72 participants, 35 (48.6%) exhibited symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and 37 (51.4%) were asymptomatic. After 60 days, 37 (including 20 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic) participants were still seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Mean change in percentage from seropositive to seronegative was more in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic patients (54.0% vs. 42.8%). Conclusion: In this study, humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is not long-lasting among individuals with mild signs and symptoms.

We determined the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all health care workers (HCW) at a hospital., METHODS: Cross-sectional study (14-27/04/2020). We determined SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in all HCW including external workers of a teaching hospital in Madrid. They were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure., RESULTS: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (88,7%) were evaluated. The mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1), and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Of these, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high- (33.1%) and medium- (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but not for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p>0.05). HWC with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR-positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis seropositivity was significantly associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), nurse assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27)., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed among HCW.

Assessment of Maternal and Neonatal Cord Blood SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Placental Transfer Ratios.,"Flannery, Dustin D; Gouma, Sigrid; Dhudasia, Miren B; Mukhopadhyay, Sagori; Pfeifer, Madeline R; Woodford, Emily C; Triebwasser, Jourdan E; Gerber, Jeffrey S; Morris, Jeffrey S; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Goodwin, Eileen C; Hensley, Scott E; Puopolo, Karen M","Importance: Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of neonatal immunity. Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies., Objective: To assess the association between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody concentrations., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study took place at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1714 women delivered at the study site between April 9 and August 8, 2020. Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads., Exposures: SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data., Results: The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants. Cord blood IgG concentrations were positively correlated with maternal IgG concentrations (r = 0.886; P < .001). Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. Transfer ratios increased with increasing time between onset of maternal infection and delivery., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy. Cord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally derived SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019.",2021,/,JAMA pediatrics,,101589544,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0038,33512440,#75975,Flannery 2021,"",""
"[Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in employees of a general hospital in Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany].","Platten, Martin; Cranen, Rita; Peters, Claudia; Wisplinghoff, Hilmar; Nienhaus, Albert; Bach, Alexander Daniel; Michels, Guido","BACKGROUND: We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the staff of a general hospital in North-Rhine-Westphalia in a cross-sectional study., METHOD: Employees (n = 1363) were offered a nasopharyngeal swab and serology for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, employees completed a questionnaire about preexisting conditions, contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and COVID-19-specific symptoms., RESULTS: 1212 employees participated. 19 of 1363 (1.4 %) employees tested positive by PCR (3 within and 16 before the study). 40 (3.3 %) and 105 (8.6 %) had IgG and IgA, respectively, 32 (2.6 %) both IgG and IgA. Overall, 47 employees tested positive. In this group, most frequently reported symptoms were headache (56 %), fatigue (49 %), sore throat (49 %), and cough (46 %); fever was reported by 33 %. SARS-CoV-2-positive employees reported more frequently contact with COVID-19 cases (60.5 % vs. 37.3 %, p = 0.006). Employees testing positive only for IgA reported less symptoms., CONCLUSION: Between 27.04. and 20.05.2020, 3.9 % of the employees working in a general hospital were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This proportion was lower than expected; possible explanations are the low level of endemic infection and the extensive, uniform in-house preventative measures. Copyright The Author(s).

Efforts to stem the pandemic (including vaccination, now being introduced) can benefit from direct understanding of the relationship of age-specific mortality to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and from information on asymptomatic infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: The Action to Beat Coronavirus (Ab-C) study surveyed a reasonably representative sample of 19,994 adult Canadians about COVID symptoms and analyzed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from self-collected dried blood spots (DBS) in 8,967 adults. A sensitive and specific chemiluminescence ELISA detected IgG to the spike trimer. We compared seroprevalence to deaths to establish infection fatality rates (IFRs) and used mortality data to estimate infection levels in nursing home residents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The best estimate (high specificity) of adult seroprevalence nationally is 1.7%, but as high as 3.5% (high sensitivity) depending on assay cutoffs. The highest prevalence was in Ontario (2.4-3.9%), the most populous province, and in younger adults aged 18-39 years (2.5-4.4%). Based on mortality, we estimated 13-16% of nursing home residents became infected. The first viral wave infected 0.54-1.08 million adult Canadians, half of whom were &amp;lt;40 years old. The IFR outside nursing homes was 0.20-0.40%, but the COVID death rate in nursing home residents was &amp;gt;70 times higher than comparably-aged adults living in the community. Seropositivity correlated with COVID symptoms, particularly during March. Asymptomatic adults constituted about a quarter of definite seropositives, with a greater proportion in the elderly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Canada had relatively low infection prevalence and low IFRs in the community, but not in nursing homes, during the first viral wave.

Prevalence and socio-demographic factors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in multi-ethnic healthcare workers.,"Patel, Mehool; Nair, Meera; Pirozzoli, Eric; Cienfuegos, Marta C; Aitken, Elizabeth","INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers are particularly susceptible to developing COVID-19 owing to close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody., METHODS: Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had immunoglobulin G SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff were cross-referenced with these tests., RESULTS: Of 7,013 staff, 6,212 (89%) undertook the antibody test during this period. Overall detection rate was 26% (1,584/6,212). Univariate analyses revealed no differences in prevalence in terms of gender or age. Compared with white staff members (18%), rates were higher in black (38%) and Asian (27%) members (p<0.001). The rates in general wards (43%) were higher compared with other areas; in emergency medicine and intensive care, prevalence was 23% (p<0.001). Regarding professional groups, prevalence was highest among nursing and allied clinical services (28%), less in doctors (23%) and lower in non-clinical staff (19%)., DISCUSSION: This large study has described prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and determined associations including ethnicity, professional groups and geographical areas within healthcare settings. This information will be useful in future COVID-19 studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations and in healthcare settings. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2021.

A serological mass screening campaign targeting the Ariano Irpino population using the Roche Cobas Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay was organized by the Zoo-Prophylactic Institute of Southern Italy (Portici, Italy) and conducted in cooperation with the Local Health Unit (Azienda Sanitaria Locale - ASL - Avellino, Avellino, Italy), the Department of Public Health of University Federico II (Naples, Italy) and Department of Health Services of Azienda Ospedaliera dei Colli-Cotugno and Monaldi Hospital (Naples, Italy) in May 2020. A total of 13,218 asymptomatic individuals were reviewed in this analysis. A total of 738 citizens tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (398 females, 340 males). The overall prevalence in the sample was 5.6% (95% CI: 5.2-6.0). Among seropositive citizens, 101 cases tested positive on RT-PCR (0.76% of the overall population). Among citizens aged 14-18, 18-65 and >65 years, the seroprevalence was equal to 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1-8.7), 5.6 (95% CI: 5.1-6.1) and 4% (95% CI: 3.3-4.8), respectively.

Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954 ). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia.,"Mahallawi, Waleed H; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen H","Background: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2., Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia., Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%-21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O)., Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.

The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population. <h4>Objectives</h4> The aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening. <h4>Study Design</h4> Open uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study. <h4>Setting/Participants</h4> A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study. <h4>Study Interventions and Measures</h4> Rapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4±7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0±12.8 days after their initial test. <h4>Results</h4> In our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%). The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5%).

COVID-19 prevalence among health-care workers of Gastroenterology department: An audit from a tertiary-care hospital in India.,"Kumar Goenka, Mahesh; Bharat Shah, Bhavik; Goenka, Usha; Das, Sudipto S; Afzalpurkar, Shivaraj; Mukherjee, Mohuya; Patil, Vikram U; Jajodia, Surabhi; Ashokrao Rodge, Gajanan; Khan, Ujjaini; Bandopadhyay, Syamasis","Background and Aim: In the present coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) era, health-care workers (HCWs) warrant special attention because of their higher risk and potential to transmit the disease. Gastroenterology services include emergency and critical care along with the endoscopy procedures, which have aerosol-generating potential. This study was aimed at auditing the COVID-19 impact on HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department of our hospital., Methods: The COVID-19 status of 117 HCWs was collected using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroassay. COVID-19 positivity was correlated with demographic characteristics, job profile, area of work, and medical history., Results: Thirty-eight HCWs (32.48%) showed evidence of COVID-19 using PCR (23.93%) or only IgG assay (8.55%). Endoscopy technicians (68.75%) exhibited significantly higher (P = 0.003) COVID-19 incidence compared to doctors (20.69%). Those working in the critical care units exhibited a trend toward higher COVID-19 incidence (42.86%). None of the six HCWs who received adequate hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis developed evidence of COVID-19. All the HCWs with COVID-19 disease recovered. However, there was a considerable loss of ""man-days."", Conclusions: In our setting, we observed a high COVID-19 risk for HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department, with the highest risk among the endoscopy technicians. A more stringent triaging and pretesting of patients, as well as HCWs, might decrease the risk of COVID-19. Further multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the risk and related parameters.

Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"Gaskell, Katherine; Johnson, Marina; Gould, Victoria; Hunt, Adam; Stone, Neil RH; Waites, William; Kasstan, Ben; Chantler, Tracey; Lal, Sham; Roberts, Chrissy; Goldblatt, David; Eggo, Rosalind; Marks, Michael","<h4>Background</h4> Ethnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. <h4>Findings</h4> A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0335; MR/V027956/1], a donation from the LSHTM Alumni COVID-19 response fund, HDR UK, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. The funders had no role in the design, conduct or analysis of the study or the decision to publish. The authors have no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work. <h4>Research In Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> In January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, seroprevalence, “ethnic minority”, and “Jewish” with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups. <h4>Added value of the study</h4> We report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults. <h4>Implications of the available evidence</h4> Our data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",2021,,,,,,PPR277515,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250839,,#78589,Gaskell 2021,"",""

To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants. Setting Two acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England. Background The UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature. Methods Healthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs. Results 633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). 7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%. 110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50 1/300 dilution; no cohabitee achieved this level. Conclusions Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.",2021,,,,,,PPR277543,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250950,,#78595,Craxford 2021,"",""

Seroprevalence of Specific Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from Hotspot Communities in the Dominican Republic.,"Paulino-Ramirez, Robert; Baez, Amado Alejandro; Vallejo Degaudenzi, Alejandro; Tapia, Leandro","Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance to assess the proportion of a population that has developed antibodies against a newly introduced virus and could therefore potentially exhibit immunologic protection against subsequent infection. This study aims to understand the distribution of IgM and IgG antibodies in the Dominican Republic. We surveyed a total of 12,897 participants between April and June 2020 in 10 provinces of the Dominican Republic. Survey efforts in emerging hotspots yielded a positivity for all participants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM of 3.8% and IgG of 5.4%, indicating that the pathogen was in circulation before the identification of those particular communities as hotspots. We found important age differences between participants who participated in the serological study where a higher mean age is associated IgM positivity and a lower age with IgG positivity. Our results highlight the need for strategies that involve community-based seroprevalence monitoring. These should preclude syndromic case identification. Also, the higher mean age of IgM-positive participants suggests that strategies based on syndromic surveillance could identify hotspots at later phases, based on the number of cases detected at the healthcare center, as such community-based seroprevalence monitoring may be an effective intervention for future outbreaks.",2020,/,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,,"3zq, 0370507",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0907,33094710,#49777,Paulino-Ramirez 2020,"",""

Antibody positivity was defined as a dual-positive response against both the receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were measured by immuno-precipitation assays in capillary blood from 15,771 children aged 1 to 18 years living in Bavaria, Germany, and participating in a public health type 1 diabetes screening program (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04039945), in 1,916 dried blood spots from neonates in a Bavarian screening study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03316261), and in 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Virus positive incidence was obtained from Bavarian health authority data., Findings: Dual-antibody positivity was detected in none of 3887 children in 2019 (100% specificity) and 73 of 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (97.3% sensitivity). Antibody surveillance in children during 2020 resulted in frequencies of 0.08% in January to March, 0.61% in April, 0.74% in May, 1.13% in June and 0.91% in July. Antibody prevalence from April 2020 was six-fold higher than the incidence of authority-reported cases (156 per 100,000 children), showed marked variation between the seven Bavarian regions (P<0.0001), and was not associated with age or sex.

The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95%CI) was calculated., RESULTS: Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95%CI: 5,8-7,3). There were statistically significant differences depending on the occupation, from 8,7% (95%CI: 6,9-10,6) on medics down to 3,2% (95%CI: 1,0-8,0) on personnel not associated with health care. The other characteristics did not associate significantly to antibody presence against SARS-CoV-2., CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency in HCP is similar to the estimated in the general population for big cities in Spain. This highlights the effectiveness of the infection control and prevention programme in this healthcare department targeted at healthcare personnel.

The prevalence rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG is 1.2% - Screening in asymptomatic outpatients in Germany (Northrhine-Westfalia),Herrmann B.L. ,"Patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). To date, few data have been obtained of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-antibodies in general population and in asymptomatic outpatients in Germany. From March 26 to June 4 2020, 415 asymptomatic outpatients were tested prospectively in Northrhine-Westfalia (Germany), to detect SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies. In case of a positive result, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA was determined additionally. 5 of 415 asymptomatic outpatients had positive SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies with a calculated prevalence of 1.2%. Reference range of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA and IgG was defined as ratio for negative < 0.8, borderline 0.8-1.1 and > 1.1 positive. The mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies of the positive 5 outpatients was lower than in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (n = 12) and positive PCR of SARS-CoV-2 (3.04 +/- 2.58 versus 8.05 +/- 6.70; p = 0.002). 4 of 5 patients had elevated SARS-CoV-2-IgA-antibodies (1.61 +/- 0.82). In 408 screening-outpatients with negative anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgG (< 0.8), the mean ratio was 0.25 +/- 0.13. Two patients were in the borderline range (0.83 and 0.86). The prevalence of 1.2% of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies and consequently the rate of infection in asymptomatic outpatients in Northrhine-Westfalia (Germany) is low.

Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center,Freeman M.C.; Rapsinski G.J.; Zilla M.L.; Wheeler S.E. ,"BACKGROUND: The burden of COVID-19 is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULT(S): We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (CI 95%: 0.3-2.4%). Two patients were positive by NP swab RT-PCR, but only one seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or solid organ transplant were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared to other groups. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and two patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

We quantified seroprevalence stratified by ethnicity, occupation and seniority of practitioner and used logistic regression to examine demographic and occupational factors associated with seropositivity., RESULTS: A total of 1148/10662 (10.8%) hospital staff members were seropositive. Compared to White staff (seroprevalence 9.1%), seroprevalence was higher in South Asian (12.3%) and Black (21.2%) staff. The occupations and department with the highest seroprevalence were nurses/healthcare assistants (13.7%) and the Emergency Department (ED)/Acute Medicine (17.5%), respectively. Seroprevalence decreased with seniority in medical/nursing practitioners. Minority ethnicity was associated with seropositivity on an adjusted analysis (South Asian: aOR 1.26; 95%CI: 1.07-1.49 and Black: 2.42; 1.90-3.09). Anaesthetics/ICU staff members were less likely to be seropositive than ED/Acute medicine staff (0.41; 0.27-0.61)., CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity and occupational factors, including specialty and seniority, are associated with seropositivity for anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG. These findings could be used to inform occupational risk assessments for front-line healthcare workers. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection., DESIGN: This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16 April to 3 July 2020 at 5 UK sites, recruited children of healthcare workers, aged 2-15 years. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms., RESULTS: 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10.1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34/68 (50%) reported no symptoms prior to testing. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariable analysis four independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity: known infected household contact OR=10.9 (95% CI 6.1 to 19.6); fatigue OR=16.8 (95% CI 5.5 to 51.9); gastrointestinal symptoms OR=6.6 (95% CI 3.0 to 13.8); and changes in sense of smell or taste OR=10.0 (95% CI 2.4 to 11.4)., DISCUSSION: Children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age.

The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients.Copyright: © 2020 Mattern et al.

To this end we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among retired blood donors and combined it with national COVID-19 survey data to provide reliable population-based IFR estimates for this age group., METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing. Overall, 1,201 (37.5%) individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Wantai) and compared to 1,110 active blood donors age 17-69 years. Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively. Using available population data on COVID-19 related fatalities, IFRs for patients age 70 years or older and for 17-69 years were estimated at 5.4% (95% CI: 2.7%-6.4%) and 0.083% (95% CI: 0.054%-0.18%), respectively. Only 52.4% of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive retired blood donors reported having been sick since the start of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IFR in the age group above 69 years is estimated to be 65 times as high as the IFR for people age 18-69 years.

To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt., METHODS: Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests., RESULTS: Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n = 54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever >=38degreeC and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n = 116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0)., CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

Information about the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and possible contacts prior to infection was collected., RESULTS: A total of 2963 workers were included: 1092 were symptomatic, of whom 539 were positive by PCR (49.4% of symptomatic workers). From the remaining symptomatic workers, 197 (35.6%) were positive by serology. Regarding asymptomatic workers, 345 were positive by serology (31.9% of infected workers). In total, 1081 (36.5%) presented a positive diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Infection rates were different between HCW (37.4%) and nHCW (29.8%) (p=0.006). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of PPE (protective, OR=0.56; 95%CI: 0.44-0.72; p<0.001) and previous contact with COVID-19 patients (risk factor, OR=1.69; 95%CI: 1.28-2.24; p<0.001) were independent factors that were associated with SAS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: More than 36% of our workers became infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the rate of asymptomatic infections accounted for almost 32% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals of the national center during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020),Krechetova L.V.; Vtorushina V.V.; Inviyaeva E.V.; Ivanets T.Y.; Donnikov A.E.; Dolgushina N.V.; Sukhikh G.T. ,"Objective. To identify IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals of the National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology during the quarantine from April to June 2020. Materials and methods. The study included 1589 healthcare workers: 1293 professionals of 'green zone' and 926 medical staff of 'red zone'. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum were determined using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-ELISA kits (National Hematology Research Center, Russia). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the kit PROBA-NK (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). The virus was identified by RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV Multiplex REAL-TIME PCR Detection Kit (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). Results. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 141 healthcare workers (8.9%), controversial results were revealed in 2 professionals, and 1445 (90.9%) workers had no antibodies, including 46 (3.2%) people who had the clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral disease (ARVI) and identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among healthcare workers with antibodies, the clinical symptoms of ARVI were revealed in 129 (91.5%) workers, they were also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 23 (17.8%) people had clinical symptoms of ARVI but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not extracted; 12 (8,5%) workers had neither clinical symptoms of ARVI nor detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusion. The presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker had this disease; the presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker has this disease.Copyright © A group of authors, 2020.",2020,/,Akusherstvo i Ginekologiya (Russian Federation),2020,7,122-128,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18565/aig.2020.7.122-128,2005285379,#55216,Krechetova 2020,"",""
Assessment of Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 in a Cohort of Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Nailescu, Corina; Khalid, Myda; Wilson, Amy C; Amanat, Fatima; Arregui, Samuel; Canas, Jorge; Hooks, Jenaya; Krammer, Florian; Schwaderer, Andrew L; Hains, David S","Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective: To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.

To estimate the prevalence of past infection in a population, the most readily available method is the detection of antibodies against the virus. This study has investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of the Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo city (Brazil), which is a large university hospital belonging to the public health system that cares for patients with complex diseases who need tertiary or quaternary medical care. Our serological inquiry was carried out for 6 weeks, with once-a-week blood sampling and included 439 patients from several outpatient services. Overall, 61 patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (13.9%); 56.1 % of the patients live in Sao Paulo city, with the remaining living in other towns of the metropolitan area; 32.8% of the patients testing positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, 55.7% developed mild or moderate disease and 11.5% had to be hospitalized. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was lower among patients who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to the ones who did not. These findings may indicate that those individuals care more about health issues, and/or that they have a better access to health care and/or a better quality of health care service.

Antibody kinetics, including IgG subclasses, was assessed till month 3., RESULTS: At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection (501).

METHOD(S): We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, aged >=18 years and residing in non-congregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020 and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. RESULT(S): Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [+/-17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic White individuals) included at the state-level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state-level reported following risk mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. CONCLUSION(S): These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and there is variation by race/ethnicity.

Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Finding(s): ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. Interpretation(s): the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies.

These have a specific perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: For this reason, this professional group initiated a central recording of case numbers, individual case descriptions and observations on infections and illnesses with SARS-CoV-2 (www.co-ki.de)., Results: So far 557 pediatricians have participated. Together they care for ca. 670,000 children. They reported 9803 children who presented as suspected cases. The pediatricians themselves had a clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 3654 children. In 7707 children PCR tests were carried out using nose/throat swabs of which 198 (2.6%) were positive. In addition, 731 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with detection in 82 cases (11.2%). Despite initially positive PCR tests, 47 children had a negative antibody test at least 2 weeks later.

Added value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a Flemish nursing home during an acute COVID-19 outbreak in April 2020,Buntinx F.; Claes P.; Gulikers M.; Verbakel J.; Jan D.L.; Van der Elst M.; Van Elslande J.; Van Ranst M.; Vermeersch P. ,"Objectives: To examine the added value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a nursing home during an acute COVID-19 outbreak. RT-PCR is the gold standard, but can be false-negative. Method(s): 119 residents and 93 staff members were tested with RT-PCR test and/or a rapid IgM/IgG test. Of these participants, 176 had both tests, 24 only RT-PCR, and 12 only IgM/IgG in the period April 14 to 16 April 2020. Result(s): 40 (34%) residents and 11 (13%) staff were PCR-positive. Using a rapid IgM/IgG test, 17 (17%) residents and 18 (20%) staff were positive for IgM and/or IgG (IgM/IgG). Thirty-two PCR-positive residents had an IgM/IgG test: 9 (28%), 11 (34%), and 13 (41%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Ten PCR-positive staff had an IgM/IgG test: 3 (30%), 6 (60%), and 6 (60%) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG. Additional IgM/IgG tests were performed in 9 residents 11 to 14 days after the positive RT-PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive for IgM/IgG. When retested 3 weeks later, the 2 remaining residents also tested positive. Of the 134 PCR-negative participants who had an IgM/IgG test, 15 were positive for IgM/IgG (8% of the 200 participants tested with RT-PCR). Conclusion(s): During an acute outbreak in a nursing home, 26% of residents and staff were PCR-positive. An additional 8% was diagnosed using IgM/IgG antibody testing. The use of RT-PCR alone as the sole diagnostic method for surveillance during an acute outbreak is insufficient to grab the full extent of the outbreak.Copyright © Belgian Society of Internal Medicine and Royal Belgian Society of Laboratory Medicine (2020).",2020,/,Acta Clinica Belgica: International Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Medicine,,"(Buntinx, Verbakel, Jan, Van der Elst) Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium(Buntinx, Claes, Gulikers) Woonzorgcentrum Bessemerberg, Lanaken, Belgium(Buntinx, Van der Elst) Department of Health Services Resear",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2020.1834285,2007000280,#44307,Buntinx 2020,"",""
Repeated cross-sectional sero-monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City,Stadlbauer D.; Tan J.; Jiang K.; Hernandez M.M.; Fabre S.; Amanat F.; Teo C.; Arunkumar G.A.; McMahon M.; Capuano C.; Twyman K.; Jhang J.; Nowak M.D.; Simon V.; Sordillo E.M.; van Bakel H.; Krammer F. ,"In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and has since caused a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first COVID-19 case in New York City (NYC) was officially confirmed on March 1st 2020 followed by a severe local epidemic.1 To understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conducted a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC. Here we show the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' (UC) group, enriched for COVID-19 cases during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group (RC), which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups, with seropositive samples as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July seroprevalence stayed stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population. Our data suggest an earlier than previously documented introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into NYC and describe the dynamics of seroconversion over the full course of the first pandemic wave in a major metropolitan area.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",2020,/,Nature,,"(Stadlbauer, Tan, Jiang, Hernandez, Amanat, Teo, Arunkumar, McMahon, Capuano, Simon, Krammer) Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, United States(Tan, Amanat, Arunkumar) Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Icah",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2912-6,2007145533,#54399,Stadlbauer 2020,"",""
A Prospective Sero-epidemiological Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in a German Secondary Care Hospital,Herzberg J.; Vollmer T.; Fischer B.; Becher H.; Becker A.-K.; Sahly H.; Honarpisheh H.; Guraya S.Y.; Strate T.; Knabbe C. ,"OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 causing the pulmonary disease COVID-19 has challenged healthcare facilities worldwide. The sustainability of healthcare systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study was aimed at the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCW in a German hospital, as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. METHOD(S): Between March and June 2020, we performed this study using a combination of RT-PCR test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ELISA to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCW in a German hospital by repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and blood samples. RESULT(S): A total of 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPS and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. In three participants (0.34%) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. CONCLUSION(S): Our study reports low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. It might, however, indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees. Our study protocol may serve as a thought-provoking example for future pandemic containment protocols in hospitals.Copyright © 2020.

In this article we describe our experience at Richmond University Medical Center with Chembio serological IgM, IgG testing., METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of patients and hospital employees, we utilized Chembio COVID-19 IgM/IgG serological testing in addition to Cepheid RT-PCR analysis., RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of Chembio serological test for IgM and IgG as an employee screening tool in a community hospital setting. The total number of currently asymptomatic employees screened was 1,866 from the Richmond University Medical Center. The non-exposed group included 1,253 (67.1%) employees with no significant clinical history and non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies. The convalescent group included 255 (13.7%) of the employees with elevation of IgG only, 18 (1%) employees with past history of positive PCR and COVID-19 who currently have non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies or demonstrate elevated IgG only, followed by 3 employees (< 1%) with no past clinical history who demonstrated reactive IgM and IgG antibodies and negative follow up by PCR. The reported 14.9% exposure/convalescent rate is lower than the reported 20% by the Department of Health and Governor Andrew Cuomo and may represent a better utilization of personal protective equipment, better hand washing techniques, and better disinfection procedures combined with strict social distancing., CONCLUSIONS: Chembio's performance is satisfactory; however, hospitals must design their own policies addressing: who needs to be screened and who will interpret the results as well as constructing management algorithms for employees with no previous history and current double positive antibodies.",2020,/,Clinical laboratory,66,11,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200850,33180450,#52462,Bardarov 2020,"",""

Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8% ) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms, 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.Copyright © 2020.

However, to date, studies on protective immunity have been performed only in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range, 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR-positive viral test with a cycle threshold (C-T) of <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested that the outbreak originated largely from a single viral Glade. Only three crew members tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of the crew members with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against reinfection (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.002).",2020,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY,58,11,,,10.1128/JCM.02107-20,,#51134,Addetia 2020,"",""

All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood., RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms., CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.

The prevalence of such antibodies among healthcare workers, presumed at higher risk for infection, has been increasingly investigated, more studies are needed to better understand the risks and infection transmission in different healthcare settings. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified.

Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage, and treatment protocol development and implementation.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biological therapy.,"Berte', Roberto; Mazza, Stefano; Stefanucci, Marta Rachele; Noviello, Daniele; Costa, Stefania; Ciafardini, Clorinda; Mileti, Erika; Mapelli, Marina; Pasqualato, Sebastiano; Pinto, Sergio; Favale, Agnese; Vecchi, Maurizio; Neurath, Markus F; Atreya, Raja; Fantini, Massimo Claudio; Facciotti, Federica; Caprioli, Flavio","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A similar course of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and in the general population has been reported. However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy., METHODS: 354 sera from IBD patients under biological therapy recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were i) age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii) healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii) IBD patients under biological therapy collected in the pre-COVID era., RESULTS: 8 out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody (prevalence 2.3%). IgG positive patients' percentage recruited from Milan was significantly higher than those recruited from other locations (prevalence 5.4% vs. 0.4% p < 0.005). IgG positive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever, anosmia and ageusia, and were more likely to have entered in close contact with COVID-19 positive subjects before the study enrolment., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biological therapy reflects values measured in the local general population. Specific symptoms and contact history with SARS-CoV2-infected individuals strongly increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 seropositivity. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

It was predicted that the magnitude of the pandemic in Africa will be high because of poor health structure and intensely poor living condition, but that has not happened, surprisingly. It was hypothesized that the youthful population and a vastly primed immune system were protective, and many people may have been exposed without coming down with the severe disease. Most of them would have presented in hospitals with other medical conditions and possibly transmit COVID-19 to health workers inadvertently. This study is designed to measure serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in health workers as a marker of latent exposure. Asymptomatic frontline health workers were randomly selected from the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria; venous blood samples were obtained from them, and the serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was determined using ELISA techniques. A proportion of participants with seropositivity were obtained, and factors associated with seropositivity were determined. A total of 133 participants were recruited for this study. And, 60 (45.1%) of them were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the seropositive participants were doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory scientists and technicians, and nonmedical staff.

We analysed the data of the patients admitted at our surgical department during the period 31st March - June 30, 2020. Among 86 patients included in the study, we found 2 (2.3%) patients positive for both SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG, 2 (2.3%) for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and 1 for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. Thus, seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8%; nasopharyngeal swab was negative in all the cases. Considering the current limitations in sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab, the uncertainty in the natural history of SARS-CoV2, and the reported prevalence of CoV-2, we think that careful preadmission triage and tests, the use of personal protective equipment and safe management of surgical smoke are mandatory also in our context of low CoV-2 incidence area.

"Prevalence of Coronavirus Antibody Among First Responders in Lubbock, Texas.","Iwuji, Kenneth; Islam, Ebtesam; Berdine, Gilbert; Nugent, Kenneth; Test, Victor; Tijerina, Amanda","BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a major impact on first responders. Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced them to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to first responders is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure in these front-line workers., AIM: Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 among first responders in Lubbock, Texas., METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 683 asymptomatic first responders who work in Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the Abbott's ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer., RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.73%, five of the 683 participants tested positive. Four of those who tested positive had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure without adequate PPE., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. The most likely explanations for this finding include limited exposure, inadequate time for a IgG response, possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract IgA defense system without eliciting a systemic IgG response, and short persistence of IgG antibodies in mild or asymptomatic cases.",2020,/,Journal of primary care & community health,11,101518419,2150132720971390,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150132720971390,33161808,#52587,Iwuji 2020,"",""

In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Method(s): From April 1st, 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of COVID-19, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference b/w mildly symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (38 vs. 17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6 vs. 10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.

Methods This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in a COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'A') and a non-COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'B'). Using stratified random sampling, 1,011 HCWs (439 from hospital 'A' and 572 from hospital 'B') were recruited to participate in the study. Immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) antibodies were checked using Elecsys R (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. The chi-squared test was used to compare frequencies, and the binary logistic regression model was used to predict the association between study variables' seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the two hospitals was 30.76%. It was 28.2% in hospital 'A' and 32.7% in hospital 'B' (p=0.129). The seroprevalence in HCWs having direct contact with COVID-19 patients was higher (33.1%) in non-COVID-19 receiving hospital versus 23.8% in COVID-19 receiving hospital (p=0.034). Seroprevalence was highest among administrative staff (44.0%), followed by nurses (30.8%), residents (19.8%), and consultants (17.8%) (p=0.001). As compared to consultants, the administrative and nursing staff were 3.398 and 3.116 times more likely to have positive antibodies, respectively. There were no significant differences in the seroprevalence between the respective categories of staff of the two hospitals. Conclusions The non-COVID-19 receiving hospital had a higher proportion of seropositive HCWs than the COVID-19 receiving hospital. The HCWs in the non-COVID-19 receiving hospital who had direct contact with patients had significantly higher seroprevalence. Seroprevalence was highest for administrative staff followed by nursing staff, residents, and consultants. Regardless of the COVID-19 status of the healthcare facility, all HCWs shall be trained on, and consistently follow, the proper protocols for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE).

RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR SARS-COV-2 SEROPOSITIVITY WITHIN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE,Prados N.; Gonzalez-Ravina C.; Vergara V.; Herrero J.; Cruz M.; Requena A. ,"Objective: Making decisions about how to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without completely disrupting our activity requires better tools that inform the extent of transmission. Understanding risk factors of virus susceptibility could help us to establish intervention policies. The objective of our work is to assess risk factors and seroprevalence in our patients in order to plan evidence-based strategies. Design(s): Multicenter retrospective, anonymized cohort analysis performed in 11 private clinics belonging to the IVIRMA group in Spain. Material(s) and Method(s): Between April 27th and June 26th, 2020, 6140 individuals undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Before tested, a symptomatic triage had been carried out and only patients classified with a negative triage attended the clinic for further testing. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We divided our clinics into two different geographic areas: region A (seroprevalence <5%) and region B (seroprevalence >5%) based on the results obtained in our population. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Result(s): Of the 6140 persons tested for SARS-CoV-2, 4470 (72.8%) were women and 1670 (27.2%) men. Over the course of the study, 42 (0.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Seropositivity does not vary significantly with age and we did not observe differences regarding gender or blood group. However, we found that individuals with negative rhesus (Rh) factor had a slightly greater risk of being seropositive (RR 2.5 [129-2.13]) than those Rh positive. There are no differences in the percentage of people in the active phase of the disease depending on the geographical area (RR 0.8 [0.43-1.52]). However, when we analysed the data according to time, the rate of positive individuals does not vary throughout the weeks in region A, while for the region B the incidence of IgM drops significantly (p=0.003) from the first week of the study (3.7%) to the last (0.0%), which would indicate decline of the virus transmission over time. When we analysed the seropositivity rate according the partner's serological status, the data showed that there is approximately 10 times more incidence of being positive IgG in couples than in random population. Conclusion(s): We show that in areas with higher prevalence of the disease, the percentage of IgM positive individuals is also higher. Also, there is a greater risk of being infected when the couple is already seropositive. No differences were observed according the age and there is higher prevalence in Rh-negative individuals.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Fertility and Sterility,114,3 Supplement,e542,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.077,2008034210,#44621,Prados 2020,"",""
[Efficacy of serological tests for COVID-19 in asymptomatic HD patients: the experience of an Italian hemodialysis unit].,"Traversari, Lorena; Camilli, Manuela","We report the brief experience of the Nephrology Center located in a ""no-COVID"" Hospital in Massa Marittima. We describe the actions taken to prevent the transmission of the virus SARS-CoV-2 among hemodialysis patients and healthcare workers and the methods for diagnosing COVID-19, with particular attention to serological tests and nasopharyngeal swabs in asymptomatic subjects. The detection of IgM and IgG antibodies through the serological test performed on 34 patients, all negative for nasopharyngeal swabs, showed positivity in 41,18% of cases. These have been classified as false positives following repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs, the evaluation of clinical and epidemiological history and of clinical manifestations and, finally, a second serological test performed after 18 days, which resulted negative for all patients. Interpreting serological tests is not easy; the strategies for diagnosis should include clinical and epidemiological history and clinical manifestations, as well as the results of confirmation tests and the evaluation over a precise observation period. Otherwise, there is a risk of considering as protected by antibodies subjects that are in fact false positives.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among a southern U.S. population indicates limited asymptomatic spread under physical distancing measures,Barzin A.; Schmitz J.L.; Rosin S.; Sirpal R.; Almond M.; Robinette C.; Wells S.; Hudgens M.; Olshan A.; Deen S.; Krejci P.; Quackenbush E.; Chronowski K.; Cornaby C.; Goins J.; Butler L.; Aucoin J.; Boyer K.; Faulk J.; Alston-Johnson D.; Page C.; Zhou Y.; Fiscus L.; Damania B.; Dittmer D.P.; Peden D.B. ,"Characterizing the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was aimed at determining asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a suburban, Southern U.S. population during a period of state restrictions and physical distancing mandates. This is one of the first published seroprevalence studies from North Carolina and included multicenter, primary care, and emergency care facilities serving a low-density, suburban and rural population since description of the North Carolina state index case introducing the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen to this population. To estimate point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals over time, two cohort studies were examined. The first cohort study, named ScreenNC, was comprised of outpatient clinics, and the second cohort study, named ScreenNC2, was comprised of inpatients unrelated to COVID-19. Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 (with no clinical symptoms) was examined using an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved antibody test (Abbott) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This assay as performed under CLIA had a reported specificity/sensitivity of 100%/99.6%. ScreenNC identified 24 out of 2,973 (0.8%) positive individuals among asymptomatic participants accessing health care during 28 April to 19 June 2020, which was increasing over time. A separate cohort, ScreenNC2, sampled from 3 March to 4 June 2020, identified 10 out of 1,449 (0.7%) positive participants. IMPORTANCE This study suggests limited but accelerating asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic infections, like symptomatic infections, disproportionately affected vulnerable communities in this population, and seroprevalence was higher in African American participants than in White participants. The low, overall prevalence may reflect the success of shelter-in-place mandates at the time this study was performed and of maintaining effective physical distancing practices among suburban populations. Under these public health measures and aggressive case finding, outbreak clusters did not spread into the general population.Copyright © 2020 Barzin et al.",2020,/,mBio,11,5,1-8,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02426-20,2005155143,#39345,Barzin 2020,"",""

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic., MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11,766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. 63 healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset., RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody with discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N specific antibodies, S1 specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17d to 25d, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months., CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health and immunization strategies.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: a cross-sectional study,Anand S.; Montez-Rath M.; Han J.; Bozeman J.; Kerschmann R.; Beyer P.; Parsonnet J.; Chertow G.M. ,"BACKGROUND: Many patients receiving dialysis in the USA share the socioeconomic characteristics of underserved communities, and undergo routine monthly laboratory testing, facilitating a practical, unbiased, and repeatable assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. METHOD(S): For this cross-sectional study, in partnership with a central laboratory that receives samples from approximately 1300 dialysis facilities across the USA, we tested the remainder plasma of 28 503 randomly selected adult patients receiving dialysis in July, 2020, using a spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody chemiluminescence assay (100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity). We extracted data on age, sex, race and ethnicity, and residence and facility ZIP codes from the anonymised electronic health records, linking patient-level residence data with cumulative and daily cases and deaths per 100 000 population and with nasal swab test positivity rates. We standardised prevalence estimates according to the overall US dialysis and adult population, and present estimates for four prespecified strata (age, sex, region, and race and ethnicity). FINDINGS: The sampled population had similar age, sex, and race and ethnicity distribution to the US dialysis population, with a higher proportion of older people, men, and people living in majority Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods than in the US adult population. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8.0% (95% CI 7.7-8.4) in the sample, 8.3% (8.0-8.6) when standardised to the US dialysis population, and 9.3% (8.8-9.9) when standardised to the US adult population. When standardised to the US dialysis population, seroprevalence ranged from 3.5% (3.1-3.9) in the west to 27.2% (25.9-28.5) in the northeast. Comparing seroprevalent and case counts per 100 000 population, we found that 9.2% (8.7-9.8) of seropositive patients were diagnosed. When compared with other measures of SARS-CoV-2 spread, seroprevalence correlated best with deaths per 100 000 population (Spearman's rho=0.77). Residents of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods experienced higher odds of seropositivity (odds ratio 3.9 [95% CI 3.4-4.6] and 2.3 [1.9-2.6], respectively) compared with residents of predominantly non-Hispanic white neighbourhoods. Residents of neighbourhoods in the highest population density quintile experienced increased odds of seropositivity (10.3 [8.7-12.2]) compared with residents of the lowest density quintile. County mobility restrictions that reduced workplace visits by at least 5% in early March, 2020, were associated with lower odds of seropositivity in July, 2020 (0.4 [0.3-0.5]) when compared with a reduction of less than 5%. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 10% of the US adult population formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and fewer than 10% of those with antibodies were diagnosed. Public health efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread need to especially target racial and ethnic minority and densely populated communities.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in Brazil: results from two successive nationwide serological household surveys,Hallal P.C.; Hartwig F.P.; Horta B.L.; Silveira M.F.; Struchiner C.J.; Vidaletti L.P.; Neumann N.A.; Pellanda L.C.; Dellagostin O.A.; Burattini M.N.; Victora G.D.; Menezes A.M.B.; Barros F.C.; Barros A.J.D.; Victora C.G. ,"Background: Population-based data on COVID-19 are essential for guiding policies. There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases. Method(s): In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures. Finding(s): We included 25 025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31 165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.7-2.1) to 3.1% (2.8-3.4). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.4% in both surveys. 11 (69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 2.0% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 2.0%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (7.5% [4.2-12.2]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (4.4% [3.5-5.6] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 6.4% (4.1-9.4) compared with 1.4% (1.2-1.7) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 3.7% (3.2-4.3) compared with 1.7% (1.4-2.2) in the wealthiest quintile. Interpretation(s): Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status. These population subgroups are unlikely to be protected if the policy response to the pandemic by the national government continues to downplay scientific evidence.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Among Pediatric Healthcare Workers in Spain,Dacosta-Urbieta A.; Rivero-Calle I.; Pardo-Seco J.; Redondo-Collazo L.; Salas A.; Gomez-Rial J.; Martinon-Torres F. ,"Spain is one of the countries most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with almost 190,000 cases as of April 18, 2020. As healthcare workers (HCW) are one of the groups hardest hit by the infection, it is important to know the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric departments. We performed 175 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG immunochromatographic rapid tests in the personnel working at the Pediatric Department of the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), including pediatricians, residents, nurses, and other staff, on days 31-33 since the lockdown started. Seven out of the 175 tests were positive, including four for IgM and three for IgG, leading to a seroprevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 1.1-6.9%). Only one of them had symptoms at the time of testing (sore throat). All seropositive cases yielded negative RT-PCR of the upper and lower respiratory tract. This is the first SARS-CoV-2 serological survey among HCWs reported in Spain. Notwithstanding the test limitations, our results reveal that personal protection policy and lockdown measures have been effective to limit population exposure.

We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. Methods: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. Results: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. Conclusions: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.",2020,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY,130,,,,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104575,,#41377,Malfertheiner 2020,"",""
Universal screening of SARS-CoV-2 of oncology healthcare workers - a Brazilian experience,Ismael Amaral Silva P.A.; Ismael C.; Marchon da Silva C.; Domenge C. ,"Background: The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has placed unprecedented strain on health-care services worldwide. Centro de Terapia Oncologica (CTO) is a Oncology clinic in Petropolis, countryside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This discussion aims to appoint the necessity of mass testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs), in order to avoid workforce unnecessary quarantine, reduce spread in asymptomatic or mild cases and protect the health of HCWs and patients. Method(s): Between 09 and 29 April of 2020, 60 CTO HCWs were tested for COVID-19. They were all tested through IgM/IgG rapid testing by near-patient lateral flow devices, while nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were added as a secondary investigational method amongst symptomatic HCWs. In total, 62 tests were done: 61 IgM/IgG tests were done and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR testing. Result(s): A total of 4 HCW tested positive among 62 tests. They were all immediately quarantined for 14 days and represent 6,6% of the service's total workforce. Out of the 4 positive cases, 2 were female, with 60 years or more, and the remaining 2 were men aged between 30 and 42 years; 3 of these HCW were asymptomatic and only 1 had symptoms of the disease. Results illustrated in the table. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): Wide availability of testing for antibodies and the universal testing of HCW would be a game changer as it: reduces in-hospital transmission; reduces a potential source of asymptomatic ongoing transmission during a period of social distancing; promotes the wellbeing of HCW ensuring that infected colleagues are promptly tested and isolated; enables the service to isolate those who require it, avoiding being short-staffed due to self-isolation or widespread contamination of the HCW. Unfortunately, mass testing is still not a palpable reality for most healthcare services in Brazil, especially in the public health sector, mainly due to financial reasons.

Of these, 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%), while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%).

METHOD(S): Since May 6 all women admitted for spontaneous delivery underwent RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and specific antibodies IgG of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum that were performed as part of routine clinical care in our institution. Ct of the PCR was recorded. We analyzed the first 100 women consecutively admitted for spontaneous delivery at our institution. RESULT(S): Nine women were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (9%) and 13 (13%) presented positive specific antibodies of the coronavirus. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 prior exposure was 15%. The Ct determination (RT-PCR test) of our 9 positive patients ranged from 36 to 41 cycles with a median of 40. Vaginal delivery occurred in 94% of the cases and only 6% underwent a cesarean section, always for obstetric reasons. No fetal transmission was observed and maternal and neonatal prognosis was excellent. CONCLUSION(S): During epidemic episodes in asymptomatic women in labor, universal testing with RT-PCR (considering Ct determination), and the detection of antibodies, permits a better interpretation of the results and avoid unnecessary isolation procedures.Copyright ©The Author 2020.

Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative. The comparison of the levels of IgG-Ab between the controls shows a significant decrease in concentrations (-10%). Our study confirms that in most patients affected by COVID-19 there is a typical antibody response with IgG-Ab present in 90% of nursing care COVID-19 positive residence guests. For IgM-Ab only 23% of tested subjects were positive on the 32nd and 49th day of illness, always in parallel with the IgG-Ab positivity.Copyright © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

SARS-CoV-2 Community Transmission disproportionately affects Latinx population during Shelter-in-Place in San Francisco,Chamie G.; Marquez C.; Crawford E.; Peng J.; Petersen M.; Schwab D.; Schwab J.; Martinez J.; Es D.J.; Black D.; Gandhi M.; Kerkhoff A.D.; Jain V.; Sergi F.; Jacobo J.; Rojas S.; Tulier-Laiwa V.; Gallardo-Brown T.; Appa A.; Chiu C.; Rodgers M.; Hackett J.; Kistler A.; Hao S.; Kamm J.; Dynerman D.; Batson J.; Greenhouse B.; DeRisi J.; Havlir D.V. ,"BACKGROUND: There is urgent need to understand the dynamics and risk factors driving ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during shelter-in-place mandates. METHOD(S): We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>=4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. RESULT(S): We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of census tract residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income &$50,000/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Francisco's shelter-in-place ordinance.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline health care workers in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak.,"Tong, Xin; Ning, Mingzhe; Huang, Rui; Jia, Bei; Yan, Xiaomin; Xiong, Yali; Wu, Weihua; Liu, Jiacheng; Chen, Yuxin; Wu, Chao","INTRODUCTION: As an emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout worldwide. Health care workers (HCWs) on frontline directly participated in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of COVID-19 patients are at high risk of getting infected with the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, a total of 222 medical staff went to Wuhan city for support. In this study, we aimed to determine any nosocomial infection among our cohort of HCWs who worked in Wuhan., METHODS: Throat swab samples were obtained for RNA testing on day 1 and 14 of their quarantine upon their return to Nanjing. Radiological assessments were performed by chest computed tomography (CT) on day 14 of their quarantine. The blood was collected from 191 HCWs between May 12 and May 15. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody responses were determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay., RESULTS: All the throat swab specimens were found negative for SARS-CoV-2. The radiological analysis revealed that there was no typical chest CT scan of COVID-19 among 222 HCWs. Consistently, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG was also found to be negative among 191 HCWs., CONCLUSIONS: There was no nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 among our cohort of the frontline HCWs, suggesting that zero occupational infection is an achievable goal with appropriate training, strict compliance, and psychological support for the frontline HCWs.

Highlighted prospects of an IgM/IgG antibodies test in identifying individuals with asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infection.,"Li, Yaqing; He, Qiang; Yu, Rizhen; Jiang, Hui; Wang, Weizhong; Feng, Dujin; Hou, Guanghua; Zhou, Hongbin; Jiang, Yaona; Xiang, Zhun","Context, Covert severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections could be seeding new outbreaks. How to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections early has become a global focus. Objective , To explore the roles of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detection, nucleic acid tests and computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, The clinical data of 389 individuals with close contacts including in general characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 etiology, serum-specific IgM and IgG antibody detection and CT imaging results, were systematically analyzed. Results , The present study showed that only 89 of the 389 individuals with close contacts were positive after the first nucleic acid test, while 300 individuals were still negative after two nucleic acid tests. Among the 300 individuals, 75 did not have pneumonia, and the other 225 individuals had pulmonary imaging changes. A total of 143 individuals were eventually diagnosed as having asymptomatic infection through IgM antibody and IgG antibody detection. The sensitivity, specificity and false-negative rate of IgM and IgG antibody detection were approximately 97.1% (347/357), 95.3% (204/214) and 4.67% (10/214), respectively. It also indicated that over approximately 2 weeks, most individuals were both IgM positive and IgG positive, accounting for 68.57% (72/105). Over approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of IgM-positive and IgG-positive individuals decreased to 8.57% (9/105), and the proportion of IgM-negative and IgG-positive individuals increased to 76.19% (80/105). Conclusions , There are highlighted prospects of IgM/IgG antibody detection as a preferred method in identifying the individuals with asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infection, especially combined with nucleic acid tests and pulmonary CT scanning.

The Light and Shadow of Rapid Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results from a Study in a Large Emergency Department.,"Loconsole, Daniela; Centrone, Francesca; Morcavallo, Caterina; Campanella, Silvia; Sallustio, Anna; Quarto, Michele; Procacci, Vito; Chironna, Maria","A critical point in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the need to promptly identify the greatest number of infected people and to implement strict public health measures. In this study, the performance of a rapid serological test in a clinical setting was evaluated. Samples from 819 consecutive patients (with or without respiratory symptoms) admitted to a large Emergency Department were tested between 23 March and 21 April 2020. Patient samples were tested in a real-time PCR assay and a serological assay. In total, 148/819 patients (18.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. The serological test revealed that 70/819 patients (8.5%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly higher in patients with respiratory symptoms lasting for >7 days than in those with respiratory symptoms lasting for 0-7 days (p < 0.001). The serological assay had an overall sensitivity of 35.1% and an overall specificity of 97.3%. A high negative predictive value (96.7%) was reported for patients without respiratory symptoms.

Exposure of hospital healthcare workers to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).,"Razvi, Salman; Oliver, Rahima; Moore, Jonathan; Beeby, Andrew","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of infection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can also amplify outbreaks within healthcare facilities if they become ill. Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

Unexpected diagnosis of COVID-19-associated disorders by SARS-CoV-2-specific serology.,"Pere, Helene; Vedie, Benoit; Vernet, Raphael; Demory, Nathalie; Kassis, Najiby; Mirault, Tristan; Lazareth, Helene; Volle, Geoffroy; Denoix, Elsa; Lebeaux, David; Podglajen, Isabelle; Belec, Laurent; Veyer, David","Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals with on-going infection as well as past coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). We herein evaluated the analytical performances of the CE IVD-labeled Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Des Plaines, IL, USA) carried out with the automated Abbott Architect TM i2000 platform at Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France, using serum sample panels obtained from health-workers with COVID-19 history confirmed by positive nucleic acid amplification-based diagnosis and from patients randomly selected for whom serum samples were collected before the COVID-19 epidemic. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 %, demonstrating high analytical performances allowing convenient management of suspected on-going and past-infections. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rates were compared in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free areas from our hospital. Thus, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was around 10-fold higher in COVID-19 areas than COVID-19 free areas (75 % versus 8%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, several inpatients hospitalized in COVID-19 free areas suffering from a wide range of unexplained clinical features including cardiac, vascular, renal, metabolic and infectious disorders, were unexpectedly found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by systematic routine serology, suggesting possible causal involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, these observations highlight the potential interest of SARS-CoV-2-specific serology in the context of COVID-19 epidemic, especially to assess past SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as possible unexpected COVID-19-associated disorders.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the West Bank region of Palestine: a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study.,"Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal; Salah, Zaidoun; Asia, Mohammad; Abu Khader, Imad; Herzallah, Khaled; Balqis, Nadeen; Sallam, Husam","OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence rates are important indicators to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the extent of the pandemic given the existence of asymptomatic cases. The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank., SETTING: The study involved 1355 participants from 11 governorates, including 112 localities in the West Bank and 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories., PARTICIPANTS: Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank, in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine check-up., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated as the proportion of individuals who had a positive result in the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the immunoassay., RESULTS: The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% and an adjusted CI (0% to 0.0043%), while the lab referral samples yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% and an adjusted CI (0.001325% to 0.011566%)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that as of mid-June 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persists low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasising the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control. Population-based seroprevalence studies are to be conducted periodically to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Palestine and inform policymakers about the efficacy of their surveillance system.

The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay., RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002)., DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak.

Here, we use a sero-survey to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in a symptom-independent manner. Five hundred three adult and 555 pediatric serum/plasma samples were collected from patients presenting to Barnes-Jewish Hospital or St. Louis Children's Hospital between 14 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. We developed protocols for in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using spike and nucleoprotein and used the assays to estimate a seroprevalence rate based on our samples. Overall IgG seropositivity was estimated to be 1.71% (95% credible interval [CI], 0.04% to 3.38%) in pediatric samples and 3.11% (95% CI, 0.92% to 5.32%) in adult samples. Seropositivity was significantly lower in children under 5 years of age than in adults, but rates between adults and children aged 5 or older were similar.

Rapid tests were performed on 290 subjects, with 255 negative results (88%; CI95: 84%-91%) and 35 positive (12%; CI95: 9%-16%); ELISA on 317 subjects, with 308 negative (97%; CI95: 95%-98%) and 9 positive (3%; CI95: 2%-5%); and PCR on 204 subjects, with 196 negative (96%; CI95: 92%-98%) and 8 positive (4%; CI95: 2%-8%). There were 358 subjects who were evaluated by ELISA or PCR, with 342 negative results (96%; CI95: 93%-97%) and 16 positives (4%; CI95: 3%-7%)., Conclusion: For this sample of dentists, dental assistants and nonclinical personnel, the weighted prevalence of COVID-19 was 4%. Similar studies should be conducted at other dental care facilities in order to evaluate the worldwide impact of COVID-19 on the dental care community.

1147 Laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection in gravidas in the first 6 months of the pandemic,Sutton D.; Fuchs K.; D'Alton M.E.; Goffman D. ,"Objective: To describe rates of laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection in gravidas delivering at an urban tertiary care medical center in New York City in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: This is a retrospective review of all gravidas delivering between March 22 and Sept 12, 2020. A program of universal testing for COVID-19 by SARS-COV2 nasopharyngeal PCR was begun on March 22, 2020 in which all patients underwent PCR testing immediately before or at delivery admission. COVID-19 serology became available on May 17 2020 and was sent at provider discretion until universal serology was sent on all patients admitted for delivery beginning on July 20, 2020 (week 18). Electronic medical records were queried to capture date and results of any pre-delivery PCR test as well as delivery PCR and serology testing. Patients were considered COVID-positive if they had any laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection including any positive PCR or isolated positive serology (PCR-/Ab+). Within each week of the study period, delivery volume was tabulated and frequency of subjects with laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection (ever PCR+ or Ab+, ever PCR+, PCR-/Ab+) were calculated Results: Over the 25 week study period, 2192 patients gave birth of which 341 (15.56%) had laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection at or before delivery (range 4.0-46.1%) (Table 1). 218 (9.95%) gravidas had a positive SARS-COV2 PCR and 123 (5.61%) had no prior positive PCR but positive COVID serology at delivery admission. Introduction of universal serology testing demonstrated laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection similar to rates of PCR-positivity observed at the height of the pandemic (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Although frequency of positive PCR decreased as the pandemic progressed, introduction of universal serology demonstrated that approximately 20% of patients admitted for delivery had laboratory evidence of prior COVID-19 infection. These findings support previous studies which showed a high rate of COVID-19 among the obstetric population.

Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom., SUBJECTS: Staff working in critical care., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients. However, staff also need to maintain protective measures away from the bedside.

Duration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies much shorter in India,Kumar N.; Bhartiya S.; Singh T. ,"Seroprevalence survey, for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, of healthcare workers (HCW) working in three Government run hospitals in Mumbai was carried out in June 2020. Among the 801 HCWs tested, seroprevalence was 11.1%. Males (13.5% vs. 8.9% in females) and ancillary workers (18.5% vs 6.9% in doctors and nurses) were more likely to be seropositive. Sixty-two (7.74%) had been previously diagnosed with RT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 44 (71%) were seronegative. Upto 28 days after a positive PCR test, 90% of subjects were found to be seropositive. This reduced to less than half (38.5%) between 29 and 42 days.

"611 Racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy",Haizler-Cohen L.; Moncada K.; Collins A.; Davidov A.; Fruhman G. ,"Objective: There is growing interest in identifying individuals with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is especially important in pregnancy due to concerns for adverse pregnancy outcomes and possible need for increased surveillance in infected women. Prior reports on differences in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are based on detection of viral RNA in clinical specimens. Disease confirmation via antibody status may be a more accurate method to assess susceptibility in pregnancy since it represents both present and past infection. This study aims to correlate racial, ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 antibody results in pregnancy. Study Design: This is a retrospective chart review of women who were admitted to L&D in seven hospitals in the Northwell Health System in NY state between 5/27/20 to 8/23/20. Women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were included. Race and ethnicity were categorized into the following groups: non-Hispanic African-American, Asian, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic and Other/Multiracial. Socioeconomic status was categorized to low and middle/high groups based on medical insurance. Categorical data were analyzed using 2-tailed chi square tests with adjusted standardized residuals to detect differences between groups. Result(s): Of 2921 women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results, 446 (15.3%) were seropositive and 2475 (84.7%) were seronegative. The racial, ethnic and socioeconomic frequencies are presented in the tables. Non-Hispanic African-American and Hispanic women had a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate while Asian and non-Hispanic White women had a lower seroprevalence rate, p=0.00. Women in the low socioeconomic group were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 compared to women in the middle/high socioeconomic group, p=0.00. Conclusion(s): Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy may be affected by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Our findings are consistent with those of prior studies and support the presence of racial disparities in risk for infection.

This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20th and 30th, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%.

The seropositivity rate in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is low and varies across different regions with higher positivity in case-hospitals than control-hospitals. The lack of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 8% of the tested samples could mean that assay is a more sensitive assay or that neutralization assay has a lower detection limits; or possibly that some samples had cross-reaction to spike protein of other coronaviruses in the assay, but these were not specific to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in children's hospitals are one of the groups who are at a high rate of exposure to COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies is useful and helps diagnose late or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Without these data, it is almost impossible for the state authorities to manage the epidemic and adopt rational measures. This article brings the results of a medium-sized seroprevalence study which was carried out in the spring of 2020 in South Bohemia. In the Strakonice and Pisek regions, the ELISA method was used to test the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies in 2011 subjects, volunteers from general public and selected professions working in areas with a higher exposure to the infection. The study showed that already in May 2020, 2.9% of inhabitants of the Strakonice region and 1.9% of inhabitants of the Pisek region had antibodies against the coronavirus. These numbers imply that for each PCR positive person, there were at least fifty others who had probably already undergone the infection. The article points out three types of problems that might occur in such a study. First, the study must be planned correctly, and possible outcomes must be pre-assessed. Second, an appropriate test must be selected with known parameters. This enables us to correctly estimate the share of false positive and false negative results.

However, whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in Norwegian HCW in a prospective cohort study., METHODS: We enrolled 607 HCW pre- and post-the first COVID-19-pandemic wave. Exposure history, COVID-19-like symptoms and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays., RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies increased after the first pandemic wave in HCW with COVID-19-patient exposure, but not in HCW without patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with >=4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up, 8 were positive (7 seroconverted and 1 had undetectable antibodies)., CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19-patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a low prevalence setting, however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.

For capacity planning of healthcare providers and to optimize protection of healthcare workers (HCW) in SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, it is essential to know the risk of infection and potential immunity status of staff dealing with COVID-19 patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined seropravalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies (AB) in HCW of a region with the highest rate of infection (1570/100,000) during COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, 4 months after its start. Employees of a nonmedical company (MU) served as control group. Demographic data, medical history and working situation were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 1838 HCW and 986 MU volunteered to participate. Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in HCW was 15.1% and 3.7% in MU. Among HCWs, nurses had a seropositivity of 20.0%, ICU personnel 20.3%, housekeepers 19.3%, physicians 12.0%, medical services (e.g., radiology, physiotherapy) 11.3%, administration 7.1% and technical services 6%. Symptoms typical for COVID-19 were not experienced by 10% of seropositive HCWs., CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW of a region heavily affected by COVID-19 is with 15.1% significantly higher than in a control group of nonmedical staff with 3.7%.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the current COVID-19 pandemic amongst co-workers at a UK renal transplant centre.,"Black, J T; Haroon, U; Barnes, S C; Mayaleh, S; Bagul, A","INTRODUCTION: As lock-downs and social distancing measures around the world begin to ease after the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, discussions surrounding immunity and antibody testing are on the rise. This single-centre observational study reports data from a UK renal transplant centre with regards to seroprevalence amongst staff members. Members of staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) with Abbott International assays. Electronic records were accessed for PCR RNA and antibody results, with data anonymised by hospital number. IgA antibodies were not tested due to test kit availability during this period. 200 members of staff (25% male, 75% female, mean age 45.3 +/- 12.0 years) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 24/200 (12.0%) positive. Most interestingly, 2/30 (6.6%) co-workers had positive nose/throat RNA PCR but negative antibody tests. This study demonstrates that frontline healthcare workers have a relatively low seroprevalence rate of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. To further evaluate this, larger patient populations, multicentre studies and different antibody assays are needed to better understand whether detection of antibodies is suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

In the South Korea, highly stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines are implemented, and reports of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs are limited. However, subclinical infections may have been missed by the current symptom-based screening strategy. To evaluate the risk of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, we conducted a multicenter seroprevalence study after the first surge of the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 432 HCWs were evaluated, comprising 309 HCWs designated to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient care and 123 non-designated HCWs. Designated HCWs wore personal protective equipment including an N95 respirator, eye protection, hooded overalls, shoe covers, and inner and outer gloves. Use of a powered air-purifying respirator was recommended for aerosol-generating procedures or long-duration care activities. A high-sensitivity (99.1%) fluorescence immunoassay immunoglobulin G (IgG) kit was used as the initial screening test, and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for total and IgG antibodies were used to confirm the test results. A microneutralization test was additionally performed to evaluate the neutralizing activity of positive specimens. Among the evaluated HCWs, none of the non-designated HCWs had a positive result, while one of the HCWs designated for COVID-19 patient care (1/309, 0.3%) was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 with confirmed neutralizing activity (1:40). This finding suggests that subclinical seroconversion may occur among HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients, although the risk is low under strict IPC guidance.

Daher sind populationsbasierte Erhebungen der Antikorperpravalenz zur verlasslichen Einschatzung der gegenwartigen Pandemie unverzichtbar. Methoden: In einem Klinikum der Maximalversorgung wurden 74,8 % aller Mitarbeiter/innen mit direktem Patientenkontakt (n = 1480) sowie als nicht medizinprofessionelle Kontrollgruppe Mitarbeiter/innen lokaler Supermarkte mit direktem Kundenkontakt (n = 300) auf Antikorper der Klassen IgA und IgG gegen SARS-CoV-2 getestet. Die Gesamtkohorte stellt zugleich 1,5 % der Bevolkerung der Stadtregion Fulda mit 125 000 Einwohnern dar. Ergebnisse: 1,0 % der Testpersonen waren positiv fur IgG, 4,4 % fur IgA. Bei einer Testspezifitat von 99,6 % (IgG) bzw. 92,4 % (IgA) liegt weder im Gesamttestkollektiv noch in einer der Untergruppen eine klinisch signifikante Immunitat gegen SARS-CoV-2 vor. Schlussfolgerung: Von einer relevanten Anzahl durchlaufener unerkannter Infektionen kann in dieser Region nicht ausgegangen werden. Die noch sparlichen Daten aus internationalen Regionen lassen Immunitatsraten bis maximal 60 % in stark exponierten Kollektiven vermuten, wobei sich in Deutschland ein dynamisches Mosaik mit aktuellen Werten zwischen null und 15 % abzeichnet. Diese Heterogenitat legt eine regionale Planung der Mabetanahmen zur Kontrolle der Virusausbreitung nahe. Ein relevanter immunologischer Schutz der Bevolkerung vor SARS- CoV-2 ist bis zur Verfugbarkeit einer Impfung nicht zu erwarten.Copyright © 2020 MVS Medizinverlage Stuttgart.

Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate,Addetia A.; Crawford K.H.D.; Dingens A.; Zhu H.; Roychoudhury P.; Huang M.-L.; Jerome K.R.; Bloom J.D.; Greninger A.L. ,"The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 would be greatly facilitated by the identification of immunological correlates of protection in humans. However, to date, studies on protective immunity have only been performed in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002).Copyright © 2020 Addetia et al.",2020,/,Journal of clinical microbiology,,"(Addetia, Zhu, Roychoudhury, Huang, Jerome) Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA(Crawford, Dingens, Bloom) Division of Basic Sciences and Computational Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson C",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.02107-20,632676026,#33925,Addetia 2020,"",""

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULT(S): The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, chi2=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95%CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Community seroprevalence of COVID-19 in probable and possible cases at primary health care centres in Spain,Montenegro P.; Brotons C.; Serrano J.; Fernandez D.; Garcia-Ramos C.; Ichazo B.; Lemaire J.; Moral I.; Wienese R.P.; Pitarch M.; Puig M.; Vilella M.T.; Sellares J. ,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of information about patients with mild or moderate symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is especially true for those who attended and were followed up at primary care settings. OBJECTIVE(S): We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of possible cases and among probable cases followed in primary care. METHOD(S): We selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups from a total population of 19 899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona. We also invited all the patients that had been followed by General Practitioners (GPs). For both populations, we used COVID-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassays, which qualitatively assess the presence of patient-generated Immunoglobulins G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). RESULT(S): Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample participated in the study. The mean age was 43.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 21.79] and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.47% (95% confidence interval = 3.44-8.58). Six hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed up by GPs. The mean age was 46.97 years (SD = 20.05) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among possible cases was lower than expected. Approximately, 40% of the symptomatic patients followed up by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic were positive.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) class antibodies] at three private laboratories (Istituto Diganostico Varelli, Medical Center, and Casa della Salute di Genova). Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in health care workers of the Veneto Region,Plebani M.; Padoan A.; Fedeli U.; Schievano E.; Vecchiato E.; Lippi G.; Lo Cascio G.; Porru S.; Palu G. ,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called MaglumiTM 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.

METHOD(S): We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitants industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear coefficients of determination (R2). RESULT(S): Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74 to 4.18), 34% lower in elderly >=60 years-old. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06 to 0.11) to 4.63% (2.93 to 7.84) in individuals 20 to 39 years-old and >=60 years-old, respectively. R2 for exponential age-dependent hospitalization rate and IFR were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent. Household contacts and MPP workers are at higher risk of infection. Our findings are valuable for health-policy making and resource allocation to mitigate the pandemic.Copyright © 2020.

Method(s): A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Result(s): Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for >=15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). Conclusion(s): Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NuKappaUA), especially its health-care/medical personnel, has been actively involved in the first line of state responses to COVID-19. To estimate the prevalence of antibodies (Igs) against SARS-CoV-2 among NKUA members, we designed a five consecutive monthly serosurvey among randomly selected NKUA consenting volunteers. Here, we present the results from the first 2500 plasma samples collected during June-July 2020. Twenty-five donors were tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs; thus, the overall seroprevalence was 1.00%. The weighted overall seroprevalence was 0.93% (95% CI: 0.27, 2.09) and varied between males [1.05% (95% CI: 0.18, 2.92)] and females [0.84% (95% CI: 0.13, 2.49)], age-groups and different categories (higher in participants from the School of Health Sciences and in scientific affiliates/faculty members/laboratory assistants), but no statistical differences were detected. Although focused on the specific population of NKUA members, our study shows that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs for the period June-July 2020 remained low and provides knowledge of public health importance for the NKUA members.

In this study, we enrolled 475 cases of COVID-19 and 389 controls. Consecutive throat swabs specimens (n=1875) from 187 patients were collected to analyzed the dynamic changes of RNA. Moreover, 162 serial serum samples from 31 patients were tested for seroconversion of IgM and IgG. Meanwhile, IgM and IgG were also detected in 409 COVID-19 patients and 389 controls. Additionally, the logistic regression analysis was executed to identify the possible influence factors for antibody production.

The positive rates of IgM and IgG were both low at the day 1-5 (18.52% for IgM, 14.81% for IgG), and then significantly increased. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that reduced lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were independent factors for negative results of IgM and IgG tests.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6,p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.",,,INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY,,,,,10.1007/s40121-020-00334-1,,#32421,,"",""
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgA and IgG Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers,"Alharbi, Suliman A.; Almutairi, Abdullah Z.; Jan, Abdulhalem A.; Alkhalify, Amal M.","Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly across the world. A nucleic acid real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal samples is the standard method for the diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, many limitations of the RQ-PCR tests make them unsuitable for the simple and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some individuals with COVID-19 present an asymptomatic infection. Thus, assessing the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs), is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the current preventive measures. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are needed to quickly identify a large number of asymptomatic carriers to prevent the further spread of the virus and assess level of possible serological immunity in a community. Method Between April 18 and June 17, 2020, 330 HCWs from five Madinah region-affiliated hospitals underwent a seroprevalence screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]M/IgA and IgG) using indirect ELISA testing. Result Among the 330 samples, 80 (24.24%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and/or IgG antibodies. There were no significant differences observed in the seroprevalence among the different occupations of the HCWs (excluding the pharmacists) with respect to the percentage of their seropositive samples. Conclusion The current study presented the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG antibodies in HCWs. The regular screening of HCWs for these antibodies is necessary; subsequently, a molecular test is recommended for those with seropositive (IgM, IgA, and IgG) samples to assess their viral load and potential shedding.",2020,,CUREUS,12,9,,,10.7759/cureus.10285,,#32425,Alharbi 2020,"",""

Methods Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer's exact test.

Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6 %) of 180 (76.9 %) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95 % confidence interval between 0-1.7 %. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0-3.8 %, which does not differ from the 0-4.8 % for 76 households without children (p = 1.00). Discussion This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany. Antibody testing showed no evidence of the feared high number of unreported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses in New York City.,"Reifer, Josh; Hayum, Nosson; Heszkel, Benzion; Klagsbald, Ikey; Streva, Vincent A","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Total cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceed 10.2 million, with over 503,000 deaths recorded. Little is known about the body's immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we describe SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses in 28,523 patients from the New York City metropolitan area and report a SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rate of 44%, indicating the widespread nature of the pandemic in the city and state of New York.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19., METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded. Results were compared with findings in blood donors in the Capital Region in the study period., FINDINGS: Between April 15 and April 23, 2020, we screened 29 295 health-care workers, of whom 28 792 (98.28%) provided their test results. We identified 1163 (4.04% [95% CI 3.82-4.27]) seropositive health-care workers. Seroprevalence was higher in health-care workers than in blood donors (142 [3.04%] of 4672; risk ratio [RR] 1.33 [95% CI 1.12-1.58]; p<0.001). Seroprevalence was higher in male health-care workers (331 [5.45%] of 6077) than in female health-care workers (832 [3.66%] of 22 715; RR 1.49 [1.31-1.68]; p<0.001). Frontline health-care workers working in hospitals had a significantly higher seroprevalence (779 [4.55%] of 16 356) than health-care workers in other settings (384 [3.29%] of 11 657; RR 1.38 [1.22-1.56]; p<0.001). Health-care workers working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (95 [7.19%] of 1321) had a significantly higher seroprevalence than other frontline health-care workers working in hospitals (696 [4.35%] of 15 983; RR 1.65 [1.34-2.03]; p<0.001). 622 [53.5%] of 1163 seropositive participants reported symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom that was most strongly associated with seropositivity (377 [32.39%] of 1164 participants with this symptom were seropositive vs 786 [2.84%] of 27 628 without this symptom; RR 11.38 [10.22-12.68]). The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04356560., INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of health-care workers with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was low but higher than in blood donors.

High seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among household members of essential workers detected using a dried blood spot assay,"McDade, Thomas W.; McNally, Elizabeth M.; Zelikovich, Aaron S.; D'Aquila, Richard; Mustanski, Brian; Miller, Aaron; Vaught, Lauren A.; Reiser, Nina L.; Bogdanovic, Elena; Fallon, Katherine S.; Demonbreun, Alexis R.","Objective Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. Methods An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. Results Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. Conclusion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,8,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0237833,,#32046,McDade 2020,"",""
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in primary care health care workers assessed by antibody testing,Lackermair K.; William F.; Grzanna N.; Lehmann E.; Fichtner S.; Kucher H.B.; Wilhelm K.; Estner H. ,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic threat of public health during the last month causing more than 10 million infections and 500 000 deceased patients worldwide. Nevertheless, data about risk of infection for health care workers are sparse. METHOD(S): In a large primary care facility, 151 workers underwent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing. In addition, participants had to complete a survey regarding symptoms and their individual risk of infection. RESULT(S): Symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 occurred in 72%, fever in 25% of all subjects. Four workers (2.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.8-7.1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. None of these was free from COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. Source of infection was presumably professional in three of four individuals. CONCLUSION(S): Our systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of health care workers in a large outpatient centre revealed an apparently low rate of 2.6% past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Relative risk for infection following health care profession cannot be derived as data about infection rates in the corresponding general population are lacking.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Study Design: Cross-sectional, observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Chughtai Lab Lahore from 20th to 30th May 2020. Methodology: One hundred and fifty-four young policemen (mean age 27.1 +/- 3.8 years) were included in the study after written consent. Squad officers who had any sign of acute respiratory infection were excluded from the study. The participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding nature of exposure with the infected cases, kind of personal protective equipment they are provided with and living arrangements. Three ml of blood samples were collected from the participants and immediately sent to the lab for analysis. COVID-19 IgG antibodies were analysed using chemiluminescence immunoassay method on Architect Ci8200 (Abbott). SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. Results: All participants were males and mean age was 27.1 +/- 3.8 years. Out of 154 squad members, 24 were reactive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and performing duties at the areas of high virus exposure. None of COVID-19 IgG reactive cases exhibited symptoms and most of them performed duties at high risk areas with only masks provided as personal protective equipment.

Although case-based and syndromic surveillance are critical for monitoring the pandemic, these systems rely on persons obtaining testing or reporting a COVID-19-like illness. Using serologic tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an adjunctive strategy that estimates the prevalence of past infection in a population. During April 28-May 3, 2020, coinciding with the end of a statewide shelter-in-place order, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health conducted a serologic survey in DeKalb and Fulton counties in metropolitan Atlanta to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the population. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used to randomly select 30 census blocks in each county, with a target of seven participating households per census block. Weighted estimates were calculated to account for the probability of selection and adjusted for age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. A total of 394 households and 696 persons participated and had a serology result; 19 (2.7%) of 696 persons had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The estimated weighted seroprevalence across these two metropolitan Atlanta counties was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.5). Non-Hispanic black participants more commonly had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than did participants of other racial/ethnic groups (p<0.01). Among persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 13 (weighted % = 49.9; 95% CI = 24.4-75.5) reported a COVID-19-compatible illness,* six (weighted % = 28.2; 95% CI = 11.9-53.3) sought medical care for a COVID-19-compatible illness, and five (weighted % = 15.7; 95% CI = 5.1-39.4) had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating that many of these infections would not have been identified through case-based or syndromic surveillance. The relatively low seroprevalence estimate in this report indicates that most persons in the catchment area had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the survey.

During this epidemic, health authorities requested swab tests, while seeking new patient paths. Method(s): A dual laboratory approach was evaluated, consisting of patient care reports for viral RNA detection on swabs and rapid serological tests in 516 patients (192 symptomatic or paucisymptomatic and 324 asymptomatic). Result(s): We found the molecular positive fraction equal to 12% (23/192) among symptomatic/paucisymptomatic (S/P) and 15.4% (50/324) in asymptomatic (As) sets. Among subsets, we observed serologically positive results, corresponding to 35% (8/23) for S/P and 38% (19/50) for As. Among molecular negative cases, we detected specific Immunoglobulin G or M (Ig G or Ig M) positivity in the S/P cohort equal to 6.6% (11/167) and 6% (15/246) in As cases. For indeterminate molecular results, we found S/P serological positivity equal to 100% (1/1) and 54% (13/24) in As patients. We found higher (p < 0.05) seropositivity in older patients (n = 8) among symptomatic and positives for viral RNA (n.23). Conclusion(s): It has been observed that a dual approach of serological and molecular tests detects a higher absolute number of disease cases in a pandemic context,which could improve monitoring and health surveillance efficacy. The age-related seropositivity frequency in this study, if confirmed, could enhance the validity of serological tests, especially in older patients.In these subjects, molecular positivity accompanied by serological positivity (distinct for M and G immunoglobulins) should help determine disease status and support decisions related to patient management.Copyright © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",2020,/,Clinical Biochemistry,,"(Pancrazzi, Gervino) Laboratory Medicine Department, Molecular and Clinical Pathology Sector, Azienda USL Toscana Sudest, Ospedale San Donato, Arezzo, Italy(Magliocca, Mafucci, Cortesi, Mazzeschi, Mazzierli) Laboratory Medicine Department, Serology Sector",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.07.002,2007243936,#28983,Pancrazzi 2020,"",""

Concomitant liver disease could increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19., METHODS: We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics)., RESULTS: Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0-1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Analysis of 300 cases from May 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0% (0/300; 95% CI, 0-1.0%)., CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has high specificity. The cumulative seroprevalence of COVID-19 by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay in outpatients with liver disease in Sapporo, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, was 0.17% (1/600; 95% CI, 0.0-0.9%) until May 2020.

N.; Neall, G.; Sceales, P.; Aggarwal, R.; Caulfield, K.; Siassakos, D.; Odor, P. M.","COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is thought to cause a milder illness in pregnancy with a greater proportion of asymptomatic carriers. This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers' characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2-26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6-55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units.

Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence., METHODS: We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93.4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8.0%] of 5049)., FINDINGS: There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93.4% [95% CI 87.8-96.9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99.0% [94.6-100.0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94.0% [91.3-96.7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88.2% [95% CI 81.6-93.1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94.0% [87.4-97.8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84.7% [80.6-88.7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9.3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8.8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9.8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10.6% (95% CI 7.6-13.6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44.7% (42.0-47.4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18.0% (95% CI 17.0-18.9)., INTERPRETATION: Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing., FUNDING: None.

In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%).

Considering the strategy of Korea entailing massive testing and contact tracing from the beginning of epidemic, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Korea may be negligible. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among individuals who were never diagnosed with COVID-19 in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea., METHODS: Serologic testing for immunoglobulin G antibody based on immunochromatographic assay was conducted in 103 patients and 95 guardians aged 18 to 82 years without any history of COVID-19 diagnosis, who visited outpatient clinics of a single university-affiliated hospital from May 25 to June 5, 2020., RESULTS: The estimated seroprevalence was 7.6% (95% confidence interval, 4.3%-12.2%) with 15 positive cases. Among them, only one had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed case among their close contacts and 13 did not experience COVID-19-related symptoms. Seroprevalence was similar between patients and guardians. Based on this figure, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Daegu was estimated to be a dozen times more than the number of confirmed cases based on PCR testing., CONCLUSION: Despite the limitation of a small and unrepresentative sample, this is the first study on seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Korea.

A questionnaire was used to collect demographic, occupational and clinical data., RESULTS: Of the 74 HCWs, 10 tested positive by RT-PCR (13.5%). In 9/74 (12.2%) HCWs, antibodies could be detected by RST: three with both IgM and IgG lines; six with IgM line only and none with IgG line only.

Seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in the cleaning and oncological staff of a municipal clinic.,"Epstude, Jorg; Harsch, Igor Alexander","Aim: To prevent shedding of the novel COVID-19 virus in hospitals, strict hygiene measures and surveillance of the staff and patients is mandatory. Studying the available literature, we assumed that monitoring of the cleaning staff may sometimes be a ""blind spot"" in surveillance. Although the cleaning personnel is not entrusted with the medical and nursing care of patients, the extent of patient contacts in this group may be comparable to medical personnel and even increase in times of a visit ban in many hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections already undergone in this group. Methods: Antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured in the cleaning staff from June 15th to 30th, 2020 in our clinic. Antibodies against COVID-19 were determined using ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). For purposes of comparison, the same procedure was performed in the staff of the oncology ward, who were regarded as an important group due to their high-risk patients. Results: During the study period, 45 members of the cleaning staff and 20 members of the oncology ward were tested. Significantly elevated IgA antibody titers were detected in 1 person in the first group and in 1 person in the second group. Significantly elevated IgG antibody titers were not detected in the first group and in 1 person of the second group. In case of positive or indeterminate testing, swabs for direct virus detection were taken, but were negative in all cases. Conclusion:  The prevalence of already undergone infections in both groups is low, as to be expected due to the still low incidence of COVID-19 infections in the German federal state of Thuringia. However, the presence of such antibodies in the cleaning personnel demonstrates the need for equally strict surveillance in this group.

Despite these interventions, confirmed COVID-19 infection rates have been high in the United Kingdom. Prevalence of asymptomatic disease in an adult hemodialysis population has not been reported. Also, to our knowledge, the development of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been previously reported in this population. Although serologic testing does not provide information on the infectivity of patients, seroprevalence studies may enable investigation of exposure within dialysis units and hence, assessment of current screening strategies., METHODS: To investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a hemodialysis population, we used the Abbott IgG assay with the Architect system to test serum samples from 356 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., RESULTS: Of 356 patients, 121 had been symptomatic when screened before a dialysis session and received an RT-PCR test; 79 (22.2% of the total study population) tested positive for COVID-19. Serologic testing of all 356 patients found 129 (36.2%) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Only two patients with PCR-confirmed infection did not seroconvert. Of the 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 52 (40.3%) had asymptomatic disease or undetected disease by PCR testing alone., CONCLUSIONS: We found a high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving in-center hemodialysis.

U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged >=12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70). In the random sample, higher overall prevalences were observed among Hispanics and those who reported having a household contact who had previously been told by a health care provider that they had COVID-19. By late April, an estimated 187,802 Indiana residents were currently or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (9.6 times higher than the number of confirmed cases [17,792]) (3), and 1,099 residents died (infection-fatality ratio = 0.58%). The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections.

The immunopathogenesis of the infection is currently unknown. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at highest risk of infection and disease. Aim of the study was to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an Italian cohort of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients. Methods A point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (BioMedomics IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Rapid Test) was adopted to assess the prevalence of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. It was ethically approved (”Milano Area 1” Ethical Committee prot. n. 2020/ST/057). Results A total of 202 individuals (median age 45 years; 34.7% males) were retrospectively recruited in an Italian hospital (Milan, Italy). The percentage (95% CI) of recruited individuals with IgM and IgG were 14.4% (9.6-19.2%) and 7.4% (3.8-11.0%), respectively. IgM were more frequently found in males (24.3%), and in individuals aged 20-29 (25.9%) and 60-69 (30.4%) years. No relationship was found between exposure to COVID-19 patients and IgM and IgG positivity. Conclusions The present study did show a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in Italian HCWs.

Large-scale seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected., Objective: To estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convenience samples from several geographic sites in the US., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages. The serum was collected from March 23 through May 12, 2020, for routine clinical testing by 2 commercial laboratory companies. Sites of collection were San Francisco Bay area, California; Connecticut; south Florida; Louisiana; Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Minnesota; Missouri; New York City metro area, New York; Philadelphia metro area, Pennsylvania; Utah; and western Washington State., Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and estimates were standardized to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). The number of infections in each site was estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations; estimated infections were compared with the number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases as of last specimen collection date., Results: Serum samples were tested from 16025 persons, 8853 (55.2%) of whom were women; 1205 (7.5%) were 18 years or younger and 5845 (36.2%) were 65 years or older.

Lower prevalence of antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in group O French blood donors,Gallian P.; Pastorino B.; Morel P.; Chiaroni J.; Ninove L.; de Lamballerie X.,"We investigated the distribution of antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 according to age, sex or blood group in French blood donors. In 464 samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2017 and 2018), our virus neutralization assay had a 100% specificity. It was used to test 998 samples collected from blood donors during the last week of March or the first week of April 2020. As expected at this stage of the outbreak, the prevalence was low (2.7%) and, importantly, criteria for blood donation imply that the vast majority of seropositives had asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Seroprevalence values did not differ significantly among age groups (but were slightly higher in donors <30yo and >=60yo), and between males and females (2.82% vs 2.69%), unlike what has been observed regarding hospitalizations admission to ICU and death rates in France. By contrast, we observed that the proportion of seropositives was significantly lower in group O donors (1.32% vs 3.86% in other donors, p = 0.014). We conclude that virus infection seems to occur with a similar incidence in men and women among French blood donors, but that blood group O persons are less at risk of being infected and not only of suffering from severe clinical presentations, as previously suggested.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2020,,Antiviral Res.,181,"(Gallian, Pastorino, Ninove, de Lamballerie) Unite des Virus Emergents, (UVE: Aix-Marseille Univ-IRD 190-INSERM 1207-IHU Mediterranee Infection), Marseille, France",104880,,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104880,,#28925,Gallian 2020,"",""

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese MHD patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened by blood tests, chest computed tomography, NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME(S): Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL: Approach Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to with positive serology tests and negative NAT. RESULT(S): Of the 1027 MHD patients, 99 cases have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 infection, equivalent to a prevalence of 9.6%. In the 99 cases, 52 (53%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (48%) patients were identified by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with negative NAT. The spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients showed IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (75%), and both positive IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). 51% of the infected patients were asymptomatic during the epidemic. Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often identified with infection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and they tended to be more symptomatic than other patient groups. LIMITATIONS: Possibility of false positives and false negatives for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSION(S): Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in MHD patients were subclinical and unidentified by universal chest CT and selective NAT.

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial chest computed tomography (CT). If patients developed symptoms after initial screening was negative, a repeat CT was obtained. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with two consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020 antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients., EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody test results for SARS-CoV-2., OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings., ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to those with infection detected by positive serology test results., RESULTS: Among 1027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among these 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on chest CT compared to 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and they were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure., LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations., CONCLUSIONS: Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal chest CT and selective NAT. Serologic testing may help to evaluate the overall prevalence and understand the diversity of clinical courses among patients receiving MHD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1)., RESULTS: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% and 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9% and was higher in nursing homes than in primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially for professionals working in nursing homes.

We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey., METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission., RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool.

Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level., METHODS: 35 883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants (75.1% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test)., FINDINGS: Seroprevalence was 5.0% (95% CI 4.7-5.4) by the point-of-care test and 4.6% (4.3-5.0) by immunoassay, with a specificity-sensitivity range of 3.7% (3.3-4.0; both tests positive) to 6.2% (5.8-6.6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years (<3.1% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid (>10%) and lower in coastal areas (<3%). Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than 14 days before the study visit ranged from 87.6% (81.1-92.1; both tests positive) to 91.8% (86.3-95.3; either test positive). In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15.3% (13.8-16.8) to 19.3% (17.7-21.0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21.9% (19.1-24.9) to 35.8% (33.1-38.5). Only 19.5% (16.3-23.2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test., INTERPRETATION: The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic.

To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

METHODS Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. This study reports crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, population weighted prevalence for the state, and prevalence adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models were used to establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. For the analysis, we considered collection period and site, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. RESULTS The proportion of positive tests for SARS-Cov-2, without any adjustment, was 4.0% (95%CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.1-4.5%). We found lower estimates after adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity: 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence, and 3.3% (95%CI 2.6-4.1%) for the weighted prevalence. Collection period was the variable most significantly associated with crude prevalence: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, the younger the blood donor, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the education level, the higher the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 antibody. We found similar results for weighted prevalence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings comply with some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, as the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise; and the higher prevalence among both the youngest, for moving around more than older age groups, and the less educated, for encountering more difficulties in following social distancing recommendations.

Social Determinants of Health and Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Community-Dwelling Older Adults Living in a Rural Latin American Setting.,"Del Brutto, Oscar H; Mera, Robertino M; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Costa, Aldo F","High social risk, as measured by the social determinants of health (SDH), may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this association has not been studied in rural communities. Using the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the association between SDH and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in community-dwelling older adults living in rural Ecuador. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 319 individuals aged >= 60 years that completed a validated field instrument to assess their social risk before the introduction of this novel pandemic. Multivariate models were fitted to assess the independent association between SDH-and each of their components-and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, after adjusting for relevant covariates. According to the Gijon scale, 102 (32%) individuals had a high social risk (>= 10 points). A total of 141 (44%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2. A fully-adjusted logistic regression model showed an independent) association between social risk and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27; p = 0.008). For every unit of the total SDH score, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity increased 15% (95% CI 3.7-27%). In addition, multivariate models showed that the individual component of SDH more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was housing, which suggested that lack of basic home facilities may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The diagnostic value of rapid anti IgM and IgG detecting tests in the identification of patients with SARS CoV-2 virus infection,Barna V.; Katalin K.; Eszter O.; Dora S.; Zoltan P.; Bela M.,"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim(s): We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method(s): Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.Copyright © 2020 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

Such loss could be prevented if there is a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHOD(S): Using CHO cell expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreaks or during the outbreak, and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULT(S): The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during the hospitalization and after been discharged for two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 out of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and one out of five nucleic acid test-negative ""Close contacts"" of COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSION(S): With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, in-coming patients, passengers and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders"", protect the medical staff and stop the further spreading of the virus.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Objective(s): We sought to analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. Method(s): Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. Result(s): None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells. One (1.96%) infant with an extremely elevated IL-6 concentration developed necrotizing enterocolitis in the third week after birth, and the remaining 50 infants did not show abnormal symptoms through the end of the follow-up period.

In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity.

Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHOD(S): The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sante study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4.8% (95% CI 2.4-8.0, n=341). The estimate increased to 8.5% (5.9-11.4, n=469) in the second week, to 10.9% (7.9-14.4, n=577) in the third week, 6.6% (4.3-9.4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10.8% (8.2-13.9, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5-9 years (relative risk [RR] 0.32 [95% CI 0.11-0.63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0.50 [0.28-0.78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20-49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11.6 infections in the community. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2.5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5-9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10-64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.

SARS-CoV-2: seroepidemiological pattern in northeastern Bulgaria,"Tsaneva-Damyanova, Denitsa","SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in more than 2 million confirmed cases and 139,515 deaths in 213 countries, areas and territories as of 20th April 2020. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the diagnostic test, screening studies for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential for our extensive knowledge of the viral spread, formation of collective immunity, prophylaxis and treatment algorithms for the infection. We investigated 586 outpatients, for IgM and IgG antibodies, by their request in Varna and the region of northeastern Bulgaria. All of them were patients of medical diagnostic laboratory ""STATUS"", Varna city. We used serological, immunochromatographic tests (rapid tests) at least seven days after suspected viral infection. Twenty-eight of the serum samples were SARS-CoV-2 Ab positive: 4.8% (95% CI: 3.2-6.9%, n = 28). IgM Ab only were detected in 1.0% (95% CI: 0.4-2.2%, n = 6), IgG Ab only in 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.5%, n = 7) and both IgM/IgG Ab in 2.6% (95% CI: 1.5-4.2%, n = 15), from all of the tested individuals (n = 586).

Prevalence of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff,Schmidt S.B.; Gruter L.; Boltzmann M.; Rollnik J.D.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic threatens health care providers and society. For planning of treatment capacities, it is of major importance to obtain reliable information on infection and fatality rates of the novel coronavirus. A German community study, the so-called Heinsberg study, found a 5-fold higher infection rate (and thus a remarkably lower fatality rate) than the officially reported cases suggest. We were interested to examine the SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody status among clinic staff of a large neurological center in Northern Germany. Blood samples and questionnaires (demographic data, medical history) were collected pseudonymously. In total, 406 out of 525 (77.3%) of our employees participated in the study. The infection rate among the staff was as high as 2.7%. Including drop-outs (missing questionnaire but test result available), the infection rate was even higher (2.9%). Only 36% of the positively tested employees did suffer from flu-like symptoms in 2020. None of the nurses-having closest and longest contact to patients-were found to be positive. Despite the fact that the infection rate among clinic staff may not be directly compared to the situation in the surrounding county (due to different testing procedures), one might hypothesize that the infection rate could be more than 30-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for the county of Hameln-Pyrmont. The high rate of IgG-positive, asymptomatic healthcare workers might help to overcome fears in daily work.",2020,,PLoS ONE,15,6,e0235417,,10.1371/journal.pone.0235417,,#9426,Schmidt 2020,"",""
Seroprevalence of immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in China,Xu X.; Sun J.; Nie S.; Li H.; Kong Y.; Liang M.; Hou J.; Huang X.; Li D.; Ma T.; Peng J.; Gao S.; Shao Y.; Zhu H.; Lau J.Y.-N.; Wang G.; Xie C.; Jiang L.; Huang A.; Yang Z.; Zhang K.; Hou F.F.,"Detection of asymptomatic or subclinical novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and infection potential of COVID-19. To estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, we evaluated the host serologic response, measured by the levels of immunoglobulins M and G in 17,368 individuals, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and geographic regions in the country, during the period from 9 March 2020 to 10 April 2020. In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5-4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5-2.3%, 95% CI), respectively. More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic locations, as well as to determine at what rate seroprevalence is increasing with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Serologic surveillance has the potential to provide a more faithful cumulative viral attack rate for the first season of this novel SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",2020,,Nat.

Anesthesiologists' and intensive care providers' exposure to COVID-19 infection in a New York City academic center: a prospective cohort study assessing symptoms and COVID-19 antibody testing,Morcuende M.; Guglielminotti J.; Landau R.,"BACKGROUND: Protecting first-line healthcare providers against work-related COVID-19 infection at the onset of the pandemic has been a crucial challenge in the United States. Anesthesiologists in particular are considered at risk, since aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and extubation, have been shown to significantly increase the odds for respiratory infections during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. This study assessed the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms and presence of COVID-19 antibodies after work-related COVID-19 exposures, among physicians working in a large academic hospital in New York City (NYC). METHOD(S): An e-mail survey was addressed to anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center on April 15, 2020. The survey assessed 4 domains: 1) demographics and medical history, 2) community exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., use of NYC subway), 3) work-related exposure to COVID-19, and 4) development of COVID-19-like symptoms after work exposure. The first 100 survey responders were invited to undergo a blood test to assess antibody status (presence of IgM/IgG specific to COVID-19). Work-related exposure was defined as any episode where the provider was not wearing adequate personal protective equipment (airborne or droplet/contact protection depending on the exposure type). Based on the clinical scenario, work exposure was categorized as high-risk (e.g., exposure during intubation) or low-risk (e.g., exposure during doffing). RESULT(S): 205 healthcare providers were contacted and 105 completed the survey (51%); 91 completed the serological test. Sixty-one of the respondents (58%) reported at least one work-related exposure and 54% of the exposures were high-risk. Among respondents reporting a work-related exposure, 16 (26.2%) reported post-exposure COVID-19-like symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were myalgia (9 cases), diarrhea (8 cases), fever (7 cases), and sore throat (7 cases). COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 11 of the 91 tested respondents (12.1%), with no difference between respondents with (11.8%) or without (12.5%) a work- related exposure, including high-risk exposure. Compared with antibody negative respondents, antibody positive respondents were more likely to use NYC subway to commute to work and report COVID-19-like symptoms in the last 90 days. CONCLUSION(S): In the epicenter of the United States' pandemic and within 6-8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion of anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers reported COVID-19-like symptoms after a work-related exposure and even fewer had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Presence of COVID-19 antibodies appeared to be associated with community/environmental transmission rather than secondary to work-related exposures involving high risk procedures.",2020,,Anesth.

Prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 Infection in Health Workers (HWs) and Diagnostic Test Performance: The Experience of a Teaching Hospital in Central Italy.,"Lahner, Edith; Dilaghi, Emanuele; Prestigiacomo, Claudio; Alessio, Giuliano; Marcellini, Laura; Simmaco, Maurizio; Santino, Iolanda; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Anibaldi, Paolo; Marcolongo, Adriano; Annibale, Bruno; Napoli, Christian","(1) Background: Health workers (HWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infections. Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19-69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. High awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mandatory for all people, but especially for HWs, irrespective of symptoms, to safeguard their health and that of patients.",2020,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,12,,,10.3390/ijerph17124417,,#11962,Lahner 2020,"",""

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Result(s): In 5 of 316 (1.6 %) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group (2/37 (5.4 %) vs. 3/244 (1.2 %), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20 %) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6 %).

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of oncological HCP and their patients has significant implications for oncological care., METHODS: HCP and patients with cancer at the Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna were included between 21 March and 4 June and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Reactive samples were confirmed or disproved by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. Additionally, a structured questionnaire regarding basic demographic parameters, travel history and COVID-19-associated symptoms had to be completed by HCP., RESULTS: 146 subjects (62 HCP and 84 patients with cancer) were enrolled. In the oncological HCP cohort, 20 (32.3%) subjects were medical oncologists, 28 (45.2%) nurses at our ward and 14 (22.6%) fulfil other functions such as study coordinators. In the patient cohort, most individuals are on active anticancer treatment (96.4%). 26% of the HCP and 6% of the patients had symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 since the end of February 2020. However, only in 2 (3.2%) HCP and in 3 (3.6%) patients, anti-SARS-Cov-2 total antibodies were detected. The second assay for anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies confirmed the positive result in all HCP and in 2 (2.4%) patients, suggesting an initial assay's unspecific reaction in one case. In individuals with a confirmed test result, an active COVID-19 infection was documented by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR test., CONCLUSION: Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found solely in persons after a documented SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, thus supporting the test methods' high sensitivity and specificity. The low prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our cohorts indicates a lack of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the need for continued strict safety measures to prevent uncontrolled viral spread among oncological HCPs and patients with cancer. Copyright © Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

"Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China",Xu R.; Huang J.; Duan C.; Liao Q.; Shan Z.; Wang M.; Rong X.; Li C.; Fu Y.; Wang H. ,"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August, 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of outbreak is a serious public concern. In this study, we used ELISA to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2,199 blood donors who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time PCR. Among the 2,199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2/2,199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be limited necessity of implementation of such testing in blood screening in COVID-19 low-risk area. This article is protected by copyright.

High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in elderly care employees in Sweden.,"Lindahl, Johanna F; Hoffman, Tove; Esmaeilzadeh, Mouna; Olsen, Bjorn; Winter, Reidar; Amer, Stefan; Molnar, Christian; Svalberg, Ann; Lundkvist, Ake","The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and spread in the Swedish elderly care system during April 2020. The increasing number of employees on sick-leave due to COVID-19 created severe logistic problems. Some elderly care homes therefore started to screen their personnel to secure the safety of the elderly and to avoid unnecessary quarantine of potentially immune employees. Secondary data from a screening with a COVID-19 rapid test for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG of 1,005 employees in 22 elderly care homes in Stockholm, Sweden, were analyzed. Seropositive employees were found in 21 out of the 22 care homes. In total, 23% (231/1,005) of the employees tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 14.3% (144/1,005) were found positive for IgM (either alone or combined with IgG), indicating recent or present infection. Of those that tested seropositive, 46.5% did not report any clinical symptoms, indicating pre- or asymptomatic infections. Reported symptoms with the highest correlation with seropositivity were fever and loss of smell and taste. These results suggest that antibody testing of employees in elderly care homes is valuable for surveillance of disease development and a crucial screening tool in the effort to decrease the death toll in this pandemic.

Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in residents of Karachi-challenges in acquiring herd immunity for COVID 19,Zaidi S.; Rizwan F.; Riaz Q.; Siddiqui A.; Khawaja S.; Imam M.; Naz A.; Waheed S.; Shamsi T. ,"BACKGROUND: The recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global emergency. There is large number of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 that are not reported. Hence, serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies is warranted for a better estimation of the actual number of infected patients to limit the disease spread and to get an idea of herd immunity. METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood Diseases at Pakistan. The study includes healthcare workers (HCWs), community and industrial workers. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. RESULT(S): A total of 1675 samples have been received from three groups of population. The percentage positivity for industrial employees is high (50.3%) for HCW (13.2%) and community population (34%).Total percentage for positive antibodies result is ~36%. CONCLUSION(S): Our seroprevalence is 36%, which still far from herd immunity that needs to be at least 60-70% in population. If we consider acquiring 60% seroprevalence in next few months, then herd immunity is not far from reality, provided the antibodies did not decline with time. Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest a study with larger population to implement stronger and targeted interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we performed a pilot study of four serological assays to assess the amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples obtained from 491 healthy individuals before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 51 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, 209 suspected cases of COVID-19 with mild symptoms, and 200 healthy blood donors. We used two ELISA assays that recognized the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric spike (S) protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we developed the S-Flow assay that recognized the S protein expressed at the cell surface using flow cytometry, and the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay that recognized diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens including the 51 domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of N by immunoprecipitation.We obtained similar results with the four serological assays. Differences in sensitivity were attributed to the technique and the antigen used. High anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were associated with neutralization activity, which was assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotype virus. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, seroconversion and virus neutralization occurred between 5 and 14 days after symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 32% of mildly symptomatic individuals within 15 days of symptom onset and in 3% of healthy blood donors. The four antibody assays that we used enabled a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different subpopulations within one region.",2020,,SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,12,559,,,10.1126/scitranslmed.abc3103,,#36013,Grzelak 2020,"",""

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) followed in the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc were rapidly isolated before the government lockdown., METHODS: After the peak of the epidemy, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in 149 patients and collected clinical data., RESULTS: Only 3 asymptomatic patients presented IgG against the virus. In one patient hospitalized for COVID-19 (positive molecular testing), we did not detect any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as in thirty-five other symptomatic patients considered as possible cases., CONCLUSIONS: Even if respiratory symptoms linked to CF are frequent and compatible with COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected only in 3 asymptomatic patients. This reassuring study concerning the risk of COVID-19 in patients with CF illustrates the difficulty to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from respiratory exacerbations and the need of generalized molecular testing to make a precise diagnosis.

Despite the prevailing pandemic, there are no recommendations available as yet for testing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of blood screening., OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV-2 antibodies, its clinical significance and to identify if total antibodies(IgA, IgM, IgG) should be tested or just the specific IgG antibodies only., METHOD: Consecutive blood donors donated were screened for standard serological panel of HbsAg, Anti-HCV, Anti-HIV and Syphilis using Cobas-411 analyser and Malaria. All seronegative donors were then screened for COVID serology using the same instrument. These results were compared with the blood donors' seroprevalence checked in a cohort in the first week of June 2020. Pre-COVID-19 period (October 2019) blood donors' archived samples were also compared. Donors who were positive on ECLIA were then tested for specific antibodies (IgM or IgG) by ELISA., RESULTS: A total of 380 healthy blood donors were included. All were males with the mean age being 30.6 +/- 6.3 years. Ten pre-pandemic samples did not show COVID-19 antibodies, whereas out of 70 samples in the 3rd week of June, only 15 (21.4 %) were positive. However, in July out of the 300 blood donors, 113 (37.7 %) were found to be reactive. To reconfirm our findings, these 113 donors were then tested on ELISA for presence of IgG specifically. Out of these 128 samples, 81 were IgG positive, 23 were borderline positive and 24 were negative., CONCLUSION: Almost 40 % of blood donors are now seroconverted for COVID-19. This is a reflection of widespread seroprevalence in the adult male population. Copyright © 2020.

Tracing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers among 3674 hospital staff:a cross-sectional survey,Zhou F.; Li J.; Lu M.; Ma L.; Pan Y.; Liu X.; Zhu X.; Hu C.; Wu S.; Chen L.; Wang Y.; Wei Y.; Li Y.; Xu H.; Wang X.; Cai L. ,"Background: Asymptomatic carriers were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without developing symptoms, which might be a potential source of infection outbreak. Here, we aim to clarify the epidemiologic and influencing factors of asymptomatic carriers in the general population. Method(s): In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. Finding(s): A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. Interpretation(s): To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India. Method(s): From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity. Result(s): Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases. The IFR in the surveyed districts from high stratum, where death reporting was more robust, was 11.72 (95% CI: 7.21-19.19) to 15.04 (9.26-24.62) per 10,000 adults, using May 24 and June 1, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported deaths. Interpretation & conclusions: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was low among the adult population in India around the beginning of May 2020.

Oncology units should implement all possible preventive measures to reduce the risk of viral transmission by healthcare professionals (HCPs) to patients. We conducted a surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection among the staff members of the Medical Oncology Unit of ASST Spedali Civili in Brescia, one of the Italian areas most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether the recommended preventive measures, promptly implemented by the unit, have been effective in reducing the spread of the virus among the HCPs. Between February 24 and May 19, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 10 out of 76 healthy HCPs (13%). Six of them developed a symptomatic disease, leading to home quarantine, and four remained asymptomatic. The infection was revealed when a serology test was performed on all staff members of the unit. In seven HCPs, in which it was possible to trace the person-to-person infection, the contagion occurred as a result of unprotected contacts or partially protected with surgical masks. In particular, four asymptomatic HCPs did not stop working, but a widespread outbreak in the unit was avoided. Adherence to the recommended preventive strategies, in particular, wearing of surgical masks by both the HCPs and the patients, is effective in reducing and preventing the viral spread.© Copyright © 2020 Dalla Volta, Valcamonico, Pedersini, Fornaro, Tovazzi, Monteverdi, Baggi, Consoli, Ferrari, Grisanti, Conti, Amoroso, Bossi and Berruti.",2020,/,Frontiers in Oncology,10,"(Dalla Volta, Valcamonico, Pedersini, Fornaro, Tovazzi, Monteverdi, Baggi, Consoli, Ferrari, Grisanti, Conti, Amoroso, Bossi, Berruti) Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, Public Health, University ",1574,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01574,632723552,#33595,DallaVolta 2020,"",""

COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers: Serological Findings Supporting Routine Testing.,"Stock, Ariel D; Bader, Edward R; Cezayirli, Phillip; Inocencio, Julio; Chalmers, Samantha A; Yassari, Reza; Yanamadala, Vijay; Eskandar, Emad","A growing body of evidence demonstrates that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 hotspots have faced numerous challenges, including shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and difficulties acquiring clinical testing. The magnitude of the exposure of healthcare workers and the potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to understand the incidence of infection in this population. To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers, we studied frontline staff working in the Montefiore Health System in New York City. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were tested by RT-qPCR and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The medical, occupational, and COVID-19 exposure histories of participants were recorded via questionnaires. Of the 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers tested, 19 (19.4%) tested positive by RT-qPCR and/or ELISA. Within this group, four (4.1%) were RT-qPCR positive, and four (4.1%) were PCR and IgG positive. Notably, an additional 11 (11.2%) individuals were IgG positive without a positive PCR. Two PCR positive individuals subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms, while all others remained asymptomatic at 2-week follow-up. These results indicate that there is considerable asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare workforce, despite current mitigation policies. Furthermore, presuming that asymptomatic staff are not carrying SARS-CoV-2 is inconsistent with our results, and this could result in amplified transmission within healthcare settings. Consequently, aggressive testing regiments, such as testing frontline healthcare workers on a regular, multi-modal basis, may be required to prevent further spread within the workforce and to patients.

METHOD(S): We measured antibodies in serum samples from 30,576 persons in Iceland, using six assays (including two pan-immunoglobulin [pan-Ig] assays), and we determined that the appropriate measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. We tested 2102 samples collected from 1237 persons up to 4 months after diagnosis by a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay. We measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed. RESULT(S): Of the 1797 persons who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1107 of the 1215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive; antiviral antibody titers assayed by two pan-Ig assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis by qPCR and remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study. Of quarantined persons, 2.3% were seropositive; of those with unknown exposure, 0.3% were positive. We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection was fatal in 0.3%. We also estimate that 56% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR, 14% had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR (or who had not received a positive result, if tested), and 30% had occurred in persons outside quarantine and not tested with qPCR. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate that antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis.

Search for asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers during the pandemic: a Spanish experience,Olalla J.; Correa A.M.; Martin-Escalante M.D.; Hortas M.L.; Martin-Sendarrubias M.J.; Fuentes V.; Sena G.; Garcia-Alegria J. ,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 can be a vehicle for transmission of the infection. This fact is of particular importance in the case of healthcare workers (HCWs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in HCWs in a medium size hospital in the South of Spain. METHOD(S): between April 15 and 25, 2020, naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography to the HCWs of the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella of the units involved in patient care with CoVID-19: Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. RESULT(S): 498 HCWs were studied. Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive. Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among health workers of the services directly involved in the care of patients with CoVID-19 was very low in our center.

Rapid diagnosis remains a bottleneck for containing the epidemic. We used an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to the 2019-nCoV in 742 subjects, so as to observe the dynamic process of antibody production in COVID-19 disease and seroepidemiology in different populations. Patients with COVID-19 were reactive (positive) for specific antibodies within 3-15 days after onset of symptoms. Specific IgM and IgG levels increased with the progression of the disease. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for IgM and IgG were 0.984 and 1.000, respectively. This antibody detection assay had good sensitivity and specificity. The understanding of the dynamic serological changes of COVID-19 patients and the seroepidemiological situation of the population will be helpful to further control the epidemic of COVID-19.

Symptoms and immunoglobulin development in hospital staff exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak,Brandstetter S.; Roth S.; Harner S.; Buntrock-Dopke H.; Toncheva A.; Borchers N.; Gruber R.; Ambrosch A.; Kabesch M.,"Background: Worldwide, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is increasing. Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. Result(s): Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. Conclusion(s): We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors,Erikstrup C.; Hother C.E.; Pedersen O.B.V.; Molbak K.; Skov R.L.; Holm D.K.; Saekmose S.G.; Nilsson A.C.; Brooks P.T.; Boldsen J.K.; Mikkelsen C.; Gybel-Brask M.; Sorensen E.; Dinh K.M.; Mikkelsen S.; Moller B.K.; Haunstrup T.; Harritshoj L.; Jensen B.A.; Hjalgrim H.; Lillevang S.T.; Ullum H.,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. METHOD(S): Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to May 3 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULT(S): The first 20,640 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (CI: 0.8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 89 per 100,000 (CI: 72-211) infections. CONCLUSION(S): The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

High SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients,Tong X.; Wang J.; Huang W.; Yin S.; Huang R.; Yang H.; Huang A.; Liu Y.; Chen Y.; Yuan L.; Yan X.; Shen H.; Wu C.,"The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined among 105 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to four patients who were laboratory confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14th day of the quarantine, while the serum samples were obtained on the 14th day of the quarantine. With the assay of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and microneutralization assay, 17.14% (18/105) of HCWs were seropositive, while their swab samples were found to be SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Risk analysis revealed that wearing face mask could reduce the infection risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.127, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017, 0.968), while when exposed to COVID-19 patients, doctors might have higher risk of seroconversion (OR, 346.837, 95% CI 8.924, 13479.434), compared with HCWs exposed to colleagues as well as nurses and general service assistants who exposed to patients.

Design Cross sectional study. Setting Four hospitals in Wuhan, China. Participants 420 healthcare professionals (116 doctors and 304 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan by two affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-sen University and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University for 6-8 weeks from 24 January to 7 April 2020. These study participants were provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to deliver healthcare to patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and were involved in aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals with no exposure history to covid-19 and 80 patients who had recovered from covid-19 were recruited to verify the accuracy of antibody testing. Main outcome measures Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) and evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as a positive test for virus specific nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs, or a positive test for IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum samples. Results The average age of study participants was 35.8 years and 68.1% (286/420) were women. These study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts for an average of 5.4 days a week; they worked an average of 16.2 hours each week in intensive care units. All 420 study participants had direct contact with patients with covid-19 and performed at least one aerosol generating procedure. During the deployment period in Wuhan, none of the study participants reported covid-19 related symptoms. When the participants returned home, they all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids and IgM or IgG antibodies (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.7%). Conclusion Before a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, healthcare professionals remain susceptible to covid-19. Despite being at high risk of exposure, study participants were appropriately protected and did not contract infection or develop protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare systems must give priority to the procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment, and provide adequate training to healthcare professionals in its use.
