SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in northeastern Brazil since February 2020: evidence for antibody detection in asymptomatic patients,"Gurgel, Ricardo Queiroz; Vieira, Sarah Cristina Fontes; de Sa, Lais Catarine; Lima, Alexandra Giovanna Aragao; Souza, Daniela Raguer Valadao; Martins, Aline Fagundes; Neto, Jose Melquiades de Rezende; Matos, Igor Leonardo Santos; Borges, Lysandro Pinto; Cuevas, Luis Eduardo ","We screened stored samples collected before COVID-19 had been reported in Brazil. 989 samples were tested for SAR-CoV-2 antibodies using two different methods; 16 (1.6%) were positive (7 (43.8%) IgM, 3 (18.8%) IgG and 6 (37.5%) IgG/IgM positive), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 had circulated before the first reported COVID-19 case in Brazil.Copyright Â© 2020 The British Infection Association",2021,/,Journal of Infection,82,5,186-230,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.11.037,2010241800,#106165,Gurgel 2021,,,1,0.376488557
SARS-CoV-2 serological assay and viral testing: a report of professional football setting.,"Hassanmirzaei, Bahar; Haratian, Zohreh; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Ali; Ahmadzadeh Amiri, Amir; Moghadam, Navid","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: PCR is the current standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to its limitations, serological testing is considered an alternative method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this study, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of male professional football players and compared the results with the standard PCR test to investigate the association between the two tests., STUDY DESIGN: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients., RESULTS: Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG., CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an inconsistency of results between the two tests; therefore, although application of serological assays alone seems insufficient in diagnosing COVID-19 disease, the findings are beneficial in the comprehension and the management of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Germany - a population based sequential study in five regions,"Harries, Manuela; Gornyk, Daniela; GlÃ¶ckner, Stephan; Strengert, Monika; Kerrinnes, Tobias; Bojara, Gerhard; Castell, Stefanie; Frank, Kerstin; Gubbe, Knut; Heise, Jana-Kristin; Hernandez, Pilar; Kappert, Oliver; Kern, Winfried; Illig, Thomas; Klopp, Norman; MaaÃŸ, Henrike; Ortmann, Julia; Kessel, Barbora; Roller, Gottfried; SchlÃ¼ter, Monike; Tonn, Torsten; Ziemons, Michael; Kemmling, Yvonne; Lange, Berit; Krause, GÃ©rard","Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an essential indicator to guide measures. Few population-based estimates are available in Germany. We determine seroprevalence allowing comparison between regions, time points, socio-demographic and health-related factors. MuSPAD is a sequential multi-local seroprevalence study. We randomly recruited adults in five counties with differing cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence July 2020 -February 2021. Serostatus was determined using Spike S1-specific IgG ELISA. We determined county-wise proportions of seropositivity. We assessed underestimation of infections, county and age specific infection fatality risks, and association of seropositivity with demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. We found seroprevalence of 2.4 % (95%CI: 1.8-3.1%) for Reutlingen in June 2020 (stage 1) which increased to 2.9% (95%CI: 2.1-3.8%) in October (stage 2), Freiburg stage 1 1.5% (95% CI: 1.1-2.1%) vs. 2.5% (95%CI: 1.8-3.4%), Aachen stage 1 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-3.1%) vs. 5.4% (95%CI: 4.4-6.6%), OsnabrÃ¼ck 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0-1.9%) and Magdeburg in Nov/Dec 2020. 2.4% (95%CI 1.9-3.1%). Number needed to quarantine to prevent one infection was 8.2. The surveillance detection ratio (SDR) between number of infections based on our results and number reported to health authorities ranged from 2.5-4.5. Participants aged 80+ had lower SDR. Infection fatality estimates ranged from 0.2-2.4%. Lower education was associated with higher, smoking with lower seropositivity. Seroprevalence remained low until December 2020 with high underdetection. The second wave from November 2020 to February 2021 resulted in additional 2-5% of the population being infected. Detected age specific differences of SDR should be taken into account in modelling and forecasting COVID-19 morbidity. <h4>Funding</h4> The Helmholtz Association, European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant number 101003480] and intramural funds of the Helmholtz Centre for infection (HZI). <h4>Highlights</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> Seroepidemiological surveys on SARS-CoV-2 are a useful tool to track the transmission during the epidemic. We searched PubMed/the pre-print server medRxiv and included web-based reports from German health organizations using the keywords â€œseroprevalenceâ€, â€œSARS-CoV-2â€, â€œGermanyâ€ and similar other English and German terms in the period from January 1st, 2020 until March 2021. We identified 30 published studies in Germany which mostly report low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (<5%). Most of these surveys were so-called hotspot studies which assessed seroprevalence after localized outbreaks or examined seroprevalence of specific population groups such as e.g. medical staff. Few studies are either population-based or blood donor-based, but do not allow comparisons between regions. To date, we only consider the Corona sub-study of the Rhineland study similar to MuSPAD. It reports a low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (46/4755; 0.97%; 95% CI: 0.72-1.30). Based on this, almost the entire German population remained susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the end of 2020. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide the first comprehensive, high-precision multi-region population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study with representative sampling following the WHO protocol in Germany. By measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we explore immunity at regional and national level over time. We also assess risk factors and sample each region twice, which permits to monitor seroprevalence progression throughout the epidemic in different exemplary German regions. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our results show low seroprevalence (<3%) until Mid-December 2020 in all regions. While estimates in Reutlingen, Aachen, Freiburg and OsnabrÃ¼ck reflect low seroprevalence mostly after the first wave, the survey in Magdeburg cumulatively already represents the beginning of the second wave. The number needed to quarantine to prevent one infection was 8.2 in our study. We also show that for the first wave reported infections reflected overall around 25% of those actually infected rising to 40-50% in the second wave. A slightly raised infection risk could be shown for persons with lower education.",2021,,,,,,PPR334882,10.1101/2021.05.04.21256597,,#106445,Harries 2021,,,1,0.385570528
Challenges and responses of elective orthopaedic surgery during the second wave of COVID-19.,"Nakai, Tsuyoshi; Iwasaki, Haruaki; Nishikawa, Tomoya; Higuchi, Ryo; Sakata, Kosuke; Matsuoka, Hozo; Iwata, Hirokazu; Sogo, Eiji; Nanno, Katsuhiko; Nakamura, Shigeko; Kuroda, Sanae; Hayashi, Junzo; Nakata, Seizoh","BACKGROUND: Elective orthopaedic surgery has been severely curtailed because of coronavirus disease, 2019. There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019., METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients., RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies. Among these 21 patients, 20 (95.2%) were asymptomatic., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most elective orthopaedic surgery patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are asymptomatic. In the second wave of coronavirus disease, 2019, universal testing of all patients should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent clusters of in-hospital transmission of the disease.

SARS-Cov2 Infection Detection by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Serologic Testing in Clinical Practice.,"Murad, Douglas; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Pallai, Ajaya; Garner, Omai B; Denny, Christopher T","Patients with SARS-Cov2 can be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the time of acute infection or later in their clinical course by detection of virus specific antibodies. While in theory complementary, both PCR and serologic tests have practical shortcomings. A retrospective study was performed in order to further define these limitations in a clinical context and to determine how to best utilize these tests in a coherent fashion. A total of 3,075 patients underwent both PCR and serology tests at UCLA in the study period. Among these, 2731 (89%) had no positive tests at all, 73 (2%) had a positive PCR test and only negative serology tests, 144 (5%) had a positive serology test and only negative PCR tests, and 127 (4%) had positive PCR and serology tests. Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e. PCR positive, serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-Cov2. On a quantitative level, the log number of days between symptom onset and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were positively correlated. However, there was no apparent relationship between PCR Ct and serologic AU/ml results.

Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Availability: Role for Combined Orthogonal Serology Testing (COST).,"Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Clark, Andrew E; Wilkinson, Kathleen; Yekkaluri, Sruthi; Tiro, Jasmin; Lee, Francesca M; Balani, Jyoti; Sarode, Ravi; Singal, Amit G; Muthukumar, Alagarraju","BACKGROUND: The persisting Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and limited vaccine supply has led to a shift in global health priorities to expand vaccine coverage. Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination., METHODS: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgGNC) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgGNC to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgGNC, IgM-spike (IgMSP), and IgG-spike (IgGSP)) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort., RESULTS: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgGNC serology performed. Prospectively, IgGNC serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ (18.0%); IgGNC+ or IgGSP+ (23.5%); IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (23.8%); and IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (141/584 = 24.1%)., CONCLUSION: COST may be an effective tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.",2021,/,Vaccines,9,4,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040376,33924340,#103363,Narasimhan 2021,,,1,0.950046907
Role of non-aerosols activities in the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 infection among health care workers,"Paris, Christophe; Tadie, Emilie; Heslan, Christopher; Gary-Bobo, Pierre; Oumary, Sitty; Sitruck, Anais; Wild, Pascal; Tattevin, Pierre; Thibault, Vincent; Garlantezec, Ronan","Abstract Background. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, health care workers (HCWs) have been on the front line in caring for COVID-19 patients. Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the prevention of disease among this population. Methods. We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French university hospital after the first wave (May-June 2020), based on a validated lateral flow immuno-assay test (LFIAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics as well as data on the working characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and 23 care activities were systematically recorded. The effectiveness of protective equipment was also estimated, based on self-declaration of mask use. SARS-CoV-2 IgG status was modelled by multiple imputations approach, accounting for the performance of the test and data on serum validation ELISA immunoassay. Findings. Among the 3,234 enrolled HCWs, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Contact with relatives or HCWs who developed COVID-19 were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during naso-pharyngeal sampling, patient mobilisation, clinical and eye examination was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without self-declared appropriate use of protective equipment. Interpretation. Main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs were i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures.",2021,,,,,,PPR316600,10.1101/2021.04.22.21255922,,#104532,Paris 2021,,,1,0.942046571
Novel coronavirus seropositivity and related factors among healthcare workers at a university hospital during the prevaccination period: a cross-sectional study.,"Ogutlu, Aziz; Karabay, Oguz; Erkorkmaz, Unal; Guclu, Ertugrul; Sen, Seher; Aydin, Abdulkadir; Koroglu, Mehmet","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the specific risk factors for the transmission of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers in different campuses of a university hospital and to reveal the risk factors for antibody positivity., METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 2988 (82%) of 3620 healthcare workers in a university hospital participated. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody was investigated using serum from healthcare workers who underwent COVID-19 antibody testing. The antibody test results of the participants were evaluated based on their work campus, their profession and their workplace. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05 in all analyses., RESULTS: Of the participants in this study, 108 (3.6%) were antibody positive, and 2880 (96.4%) were negative. Antibody positivity rates were greater in nurses compared with other healthcare workers (p < 0.001). Regarding workplace, antibody positivity was greater in those working in intensive care compared to those working in other locations (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at the highest risk of being infected with COVID-19. Those who have a higher risk of infection among healthcare workers and those working in high-risk areas should be vaccinated early and use personal protective equipment during the pandemic., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospective permission was obtained from both the local ethics committee and the Turkish Ministry of Health for this study (IRB No:71522473/050.01.04/370, Date: 05.20.2020).",2021,/,Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,20,1,31,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12941-021-00436-9,33902614,#103648,Ogutlu 2021,,,1,0.682488503
From first to second wave: follow-up of the prospective Covid-19 cohort (KoCo19) in Munich (Germany),"Radon, Katja; Bakuli, Abhishek; Puetz, Peter; Le Gleut, Ronan; Guggenbuehl Noller, Jessica Michelle; Olbrich, Laura; Saathoff, Elmar; Gari, Merce; Schaelte, Yannik; Frahnow, Turid; Woelfel, Roman; Pritsch, Michael; Rothe, Camilla; Pletschette, Michel; Rubio-Acero, Raquel; Beyerl, Jessica; Metaxa, Dafni; Forster, Felix; Thiel, Verena; Castelletti, Noemi; Riess, Friedrich; Diefenbach, Maximilian; Froeschl, Guenter; Bruger, Jan Marius; Winter, Simon Michael; Frese, Jonathan Leon; Puchinger, Kerstin; Brand, Isabel; Kroidl, Inge; Wieser, Andreas; Hoelscher, Michael; Hasenauer, Jan; Fuchs, Christiane; =KoCo19 study group","<h4>Background: </h4> In the 2nd year of the Covid-19 pandemic, knowledge about the dynamics of the infection in the general population is still limited. Such information is essential for health planners, as many of those infected show no or only mild symptoms and thus, escape the surveillance system. We therefore aimed to describe the course of the pandemic in the Munich general population living in private households from April 2020 to January 2021. <h4>Methods:</h4> The KoCo19 baseline study took place from April to June 2020 including 5313 participants (age 14 years and above). From November 2020 to January 2021, we could again measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in 4,433 of the baseline participants (response 83%). Participants were offered a self-sampling kit to take a capillary blood sample (dry blood spot; DBS). Blood was analysed using the Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche). Questionnaire information on socio-demographics and potential risk factors assessed at baseline was available for all participants. In addition, follow-up information on health-risk taking behaviour and number of personal contacts outside the household (N=2768) as well as leisure time activities (N=1263) were collected in summer 2020. <h4>Results:</h4> Weighted and adjusted (for specificity and sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.3%) as compared to 1.8% (95% CI 1.3-3.4%) at baseline. 91% of those tested positive at baseline were also antibody-positive at follow-up. While sero-prevalence increased from early November 2021 to January 2021, no indication of geospatial clustering across the city of Munich was found, although cases clustered within households. Taking baseline result and time to follow-up into account, men and participants in the age group 20-34 years were at the highest risk of sero-positivity. In the sensitivity analyses, differences in health-risk taking behaviour, number of personal contacts and leisure time activities partly explained these differences. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The number of citizens in Munich with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was still below 5% during the 2nd wave of the pandemic. Antibodies remained present in the majority of baseline participants. Besides age and sex, potentially confounded by differences in behaviour, no major risk factors could be identified. Non-pharmaceutical public health measures are thus still important.",2021,,,,,,PPR318808,10.1101/2021.04.27.21256133,,#104553,Radon 2021,,,1,0.52321561

The first stage used a dried blood spot screening test initiated on June 15, 2020. Those participants identified as reactive were advised to have confirmatory testing via a venipuncture. Venipuncture results through August 8, 2020, were considered. Consent and authorization for testing was required to participate in the screening program. This report, which was conducted under an institutional review board-approved protocol, only includes employees who have further authorized their records for use in research., RESULTS: A total of 81,113 health care personnel were eligible for the program, and of these 29,606 participated in the screening program. A total of 4284 (14.5%) of the dried blood spot test results were ""reactive"" and warranted confirmatory testing. Confirmatory testing was completed on 4094 (95.6%) of the screen reactive with an overall seroprevalence rate of 0.60% (95% CI, 0.52% to 0.69%). Significant variation in seroprevalence was observed by region of the country and age group., CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through August 8, 2020, was found to be lower than previously reported in other health care organizations.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Antibody Seroprevalence among UK Healthcare Professionals Working with Cancer Patients during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Favara, D M; McAdam, K; Cooke, A; Bordessa-Kelly, A; Budriunaite, I; Bossingham, S; Houghton, S; Doffinger, R; Ainsworth, N; Corrie, P G","AIMS: The proportion of UK oncology healthcare professionals (HCPs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence rates among HCPs., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-facing oncology HCPs working at three large UK hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing [Luminex and point-of-care (POC) tests] on two occasions 28 days apart (June-July 2020)., RESULTS: In total, 434 HCPs were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%), administrators (10.1%); 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2. All participants were PCR negative during the study, but 18.4% were Luminex seropositive on day 1, of whom 42.5% were POC seropositive. Nurses had the highest seropositive prevalence trend (21.3%, P = 0.2). Thirty-eight per cent of seropositive HCPs reported previous SARS-CoV-2 symptoms: 1.9 times higher odds than seronegative HCPs (P = 0.01). Of 400 participants retested on day 28, 13.3% were Luminex seropositive (92.5% previously, 7.5% newly). Thirty-two per cent of initially seropositive HCPs were seronegative on day 28., CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of PCR-negative patient-facing oncology HCPs, almost one in five were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of the pandemic's first wave. Our findings that one in three seropositive HCPs retested 28 days later became seronegative support regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing until widespread immunity is achieved by effective vaccination.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Healthcare Workers by Job Function and Work Location in a New York Inner-City Hospital.,"Purswani, Murli U; Bucciarelli, Jessica; Tiburcio, Jose; Yagudayev, Shamuel M; Connell, Georgia H; Omidiran, Arafat A; Hannaway, Launcelot; Zeana, Cosmina; Healy, Maureen; Yu, Gary; Reich, Doug","OBJECTIVE: To describe the seroprevalence and risk for SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCWs) by job function and work location following the pandemic's first wave in New York City (NYC)., METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively., CONCLUSION: One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC.

Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk., METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history., RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66)., CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.",2021,/,Journal of hospital medicine,16,5,274-281,,https://dx.doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3609,33929947,#105229,Khan 2021,,,1,0.657947142

Rapidly increasing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and limited clinical disease in three Malian communities: a prospective cohort study,"Sagara, Issaka; Woodford, John; Kone, Mamady; Assadou, Mahamadoun Hamady; Katile, Abdoulaye; Attaher, Oumar; Zeguime, Amatigue; Doucoure, M'Bouye; Higbee, Emily; Lane, Jacquelyn; Doritchamou, Justin; Zaidi, Irfan; Esposito, Dominic; Kwan, Jennifer; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Dicko, Alassane; Duffy, Patrick","<h4>Background: </h4> The extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission in Mali and the surrounding region is not well understood, although infection has been confirmed in nearly 14,000 symptomatic individuals and their contacts since the first case in March 2020. We aimed to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in three Malian communities, and understand factors associated with infection. Methods Between 27 July 2020 and 29 January 2021, we collected blood samples along with demographic, social, medical and self-reported symptoms information from residents aged 6 months and older in three study communities at two study visits. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured using a highly specific two-antigen ELISA optimized for use in Mali. We calculated cumulative adjusted seroprevalence for each site and evaluated factors associated with serostatus at each visit by univariate and multivariate analysis. Findings Overall, 94.8% (2533/2672) of participants completed both study visits. A total of 50.3% (1343/2672) of participants were male, and 31.3% (837/2672) were aged <10 years, 27.6% (737/2672) were aged 10-17 years, and 41.1% (1098/2572) were aged >/=18 years. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 exposure rate was 58.5% (95% CI: 47.5 to 69.4). This varied between sites and was 73.4% (95% CI: 59.2 to 87.5) in the urban community of Sotuba, 53.2% (95% CI: 42.8 to 63.6) in the rural town of Bancoumana, and 37.1% (95% CI: 29.6 to 44.5) in the rural village of Doneguebougou. This equates to an infection rate of approximately 1% of the population every three days in the study communities between visits. Increased age and study site were associated with serostatus at both study visits. There was minimal difference in reported symptoms based on serostatus. Interpretation The true extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Mali is greater than previously reported and now approaches hypothetical herd immunity in urban areas. The epidemiology of the pandemic in the region may be primarily subclinical and within background illness rates. In this setting, ongoing surveillance and augmentation of diagnostics to characterize locally circulating variants will be critical to implement effective mitigation strategies like vaccines.

Incidence of COVID-19 recurrence among large cohort of healthcare employees.,"Veronica, Fitzpatrick; Anne, Rivelli; Christopher, Blair; Kenneth, Copeland; Jon, Richards","PURPOSE: To quantify COVID-19 recurrence among clinical and non-clinical healthcare employees with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies or prior COVID-19 infection., METHODS: This prospective, cohort study collected and resulted SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples as positive or negative from June 8 to July 10, 2020 from a convenience sample of 16,233 adult participants employed by a large Midwestern healthcare system. Documented positive PCR test results representing COVID-19 infections were recorded up to four months prior to and post-IgG testing., RESULTS: 913 (6.12%) participants, including 45 (4.93%) IgG positive participants, experienced COVID-19 infections after study initiation, representing a 51% increased risk of COVID-19 infection among IgG positive participants (IRR=1.51). Regressions adjusted for documented disparities showed no difference in COVID-19 infection by IgG status (OR=1.19; p=0.3117) but significantly greater odds in COVID-19 recurrence among participants with a prior documented COVID-19 infection (OR=1.93; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and prior COVID-19 infection do not appear to offer meaningful protection against COVID-19 recurrence in healthcare workers. Recurrence would impact decisions regarding ongoing healthcare resource utilization. This study can inform considerations for vaccine administration to vulnerable groups.

Identification of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in seroprevalence studies among vaccinated populations,"Demmer, Ryan; Baumgartner, Brett; Wiggen, Talia; Ulrich, Angela; Strickland, Ali; Naumchik, Brianna; Bohn, Bruno; Walsh, Sara; Smith, Stephen; Kline, Susan; Stovitz, Steve; Yendell, Stephanie; Beebe, Tim; Hedberg, Craig","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Importance</h4> Identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via antibody assays is important for monitoring natural infection rates. Most antibody assays cannot distinguish natural infection from vaccination. <h4>Objective</h4> To assess the accuracy of a nucleocapsid-containing assay in identifying natural infection among vaccinated individuals. <h4>Design</h4> A longitudinal cohort comprised of healthcare workers (HCW) in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area was enrolled. Two rounds of seroprevalence studies separated by one month were conducted from 11/2020â€“1/2021. Capillary blood from round 1 and 2 was tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with a qualitative chemiluminescent ELISA (spike-only assay). In a subsample of participants (n=82) at round 2, a second assay was performed that measured IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nucleocapsid-containing assay). Round 1 biospecimen collections occurred prior to vaccination in all participants. Vaccination status at round 2 was determined via self-report. <h4>Setting</h4> The Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. <h4>Participants</h4> HCW age 18-80 years. <h4>Exposures</h4> Round 1 recent SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via a spike-only assay and participant self-report. <h4>Outcomes</h4> Round 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via the nucleocapsid-containing assay. Area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the discriminatory ability of round 2 IgG reactivity to nucleocapsid for identification of recent infection determined during round 1 <h4>Results</h4> Participants had a mean age of 40 (range=23-66) years, 83% were female, 46% reported vaccination prior to the round 2 testing. Round 1 seroprevalence was 9.5%. Among those not recently infected, when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, elevated levels of spike 1 (p<0.001) and spike 2 (p=0.01) were observed while nucleocapsid levels were not statistically significantly different (p=0.90). Among all participants, nucleocapsid response predicted recent infection with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.93(0.88,0.99). Among individuals vaccinated >10 days prior to antibody testing, the specificity of the nucleocapsid-containing assay was 92% and while the specificity of the spike-only assay was 0%. <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> An IgG assay identifying reactivity to nucleocapsid protein is an accurate predictor of natural infection among vaccinated individuals while a spike-only assay performed poorly. In the era of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seroprevalence studies monitoring natural infection will require assays that do not rely on spike-protein response alone.",2021,,,,,,PPR313425,10.1101/2021.04.12.21255330,,#102921,Demmer 2021,,,1,0.208819826

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-Specific IgG Antibodies Among Adults Living in Connecticut: Post-Infection Prevalence (PIP) Study,"Massey, Dorothy S.; Li, Shu-Xia; Mahajan, Shiwani; Lin, Zhenqiu; Srinivasan, Rajesh; Huston, Sara K.; Dugan, Andrew; Witters, Dan; Marlar, Jenny; Hodge, Domonique; Chattopadhyay, Manas; Stewart, Chris; Redlich, Carrie A.; Anastasio, Kelly M.; Cashman, Lisa; Kuppusamy, Karthik; Adams, Mark D.; Lee, Charles; Rao, Lokinendi V.; Ko, Albert I.; Krumholz, Harlan M. ","Background: A seroprevalence study can estimate the percentage of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in the general population; however, most existing reports have used a convenience sample, which may bias their estimates. Method(s): We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, ages >=18 years and residing in noncongregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020, and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among this population. Result(s): Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [+/- 17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic white individuals) included at the state level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state level reported following risk-mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. Conclusion(s): These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and there is variation by race and ethnicity. There is a need for continued adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among Connecticut residents to prevent resurgence of COVID-19 in this region.Copyright Â© 2020",2021,/,American Journal of Medicine,134,4,526,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.09.024,2010369107,#102726,Massey 2021,,,1,0.972500374
"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the largest initial epidemic wave in the United States: Findings from New York City, May 13-July 21, 2020","Pathela, Preeti; Crawley, Addie; Weiss, Don; Maldin, Beth; Cornell, Jennifer; Purdin, Jeff; Schumacher, Pamela K.; Marovich, Stacey; Li, Joyce; Daskalakis, Demetre ","BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) was the U.S. epicenter of the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHOD(S): From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULT(S): Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSION(S): Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given disparities in infection risk, effective interventions for at-risk groups are needed during ongoing transmission.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Nationwide seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Israel.,"Reicher, Shay; Ratzon, Ronit; Ben-Sahar, Shay; Hermoni-Alon, Sharon; Mossinson, David; Shenhar, Yotam; Friger, Michael; Lustig, Yaniv; Alroy-Preis, Sharon; Anis, Emilia; Sadetzki, Siegal; Kaliner, Ehud","The first local spread of COVID-19 in Israel was detected in March 2020. Due to the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin). The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher risk to be seropositive. The prevalence-to-incidence ratio was 4.5-15.7. Serology testing is an important complimentary tool for assessing the actual magnitude of infection and thus essential for implementing policy measures to control the pandemic.

Application of a SARS-CoV-2-specific serologic assay for translational research and surveillance,"Sherman, Amy C.; Espinoza, Daniel; Zhu, Yerun; Wu, Henry M.; Rouphael, Nadine; Fridkin, Scott; Smith, Teresa C.; Taibl, Kaitlin R.; Howard-Anderson, Jessica; Fairley, Jessica K.; Edupuganti, Sri; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Ospina, Jaime Cardona; Arias, Juan Carlos Sepulveda; Collins, Matthew H. ","Background: Sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody diagnostics are urgently needed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the general population and special risk groups. Moreover, validated serologic assays are critical to understanding immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time and identifying correlates of protection. Method(s): An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol to detect antibodies (IgG) that bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was validated and ROC curve analysis performed by testing a large panel of pre-pandemic sera (n=162) and convalescent sera from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=60). We then applied this test in two cohorts: 1) Healthcare personnel (HCP) that were enrolled in a longitudinal surveillance cohort just after peak local transmission and 2) Mildly ill patients being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR from NP swabs in an ambulatory testing clinic. Result(s): ROC curve analysis yielded an AUC of 0.9953, with a sensitivity and specificity at 91.67% and 99.38% at the optimal OD normalization threshold of 0.20. In 240 HCP surveilled at enrollment, 5.83% had positive IgG results. Of 19 symptomatic patients who presented to the ambulatory clinic, 5/19 had a positive PCR. In convalescence (13-74 days post symptom onset), 3 of those 5 were positive for IgG. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA. This simple assay is an efficient way to track seroconversion and duration of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 for different populations, particularly since RBD-binding antibodies have been shown to correlate with neutralization activity and may be useful to determine protective immunity following natural infection or vaccination. Ongoing work will assess variation in magnitude, character and duration of antibody responses in key populations and seek to maximize deployability of large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serology.

There were 17 new cases after the second testing, meaning 90.6% (144/159) of inmates had some positive result. Comorbidities were present in 67.3%; two hospitalizations and no COVID-related deaths were recorded., CONCLUSION: More than 90% of inmates over the age of 60 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Periodic health monitoring, active case finding and early care for symptomatic patients were the main actions that contributed to positive post-infection outcomes. Such measures must be considered as essential components for the surveillance of COVID-19 in environments with limited capacity to promote social distance, such as penitentiary institutions.

"SARS-Cov-2 RNA and antibodies among people experiencing homelessness and staying in shelters or outdoor encampments in Denver, Colorado, May-July 2020","McCormick, David; Wilcox, Kay; Marx, Grace E.; Scott, Tracy; Chavez, Jesse; Wendel, Karen; Burman, William; Stella, Sarah A. ","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected people experiencing homelessness (PEH) residing in shelters. Initial and regular testing of PEH in communities with moderate or substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may limit spread in shelters. We analyzed factors associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody tests for PEH staying in shelters or encampments in Denver, Colorado. Methods. In May 2020, Denver Public Health collaborated with local leaders to identify 4 homeless shelters and 3 outdoor encampments for voluntary, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing. At each testing event, a short questionnaire including sociodemographic factors and symptoms was administered to PEH who consented to testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs; antibody testing was performed on venous blood samples. PEH reporting a prior positive RT-PCR test were not retested but were eligible for antibody testing. Statistical calculations were performed with an alpha of 0.05; all tests were two-sided. Results. From June 2-July 28, 2020, 931 PEH were approached. A total of 863 RT-PCR tests were performed at 14 testing events, and 334 antibody tests were performed at 5 testing events. Overall, 604 and 259 RT-PCR tests were conducted in 4 shelters and 3 encampments, respectively; 189 and 145 antibody tests were conducted in 3 shelters and 2 encampments, respectively. PEH tested in shelters were older, more often men, less often Native American, and less likely to report COVID-19 symptoms than those tested at encampments (Table 1). Overall, 9% of PEH tested in shelters tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 3% of PEH tested in encampments (p=0.002); 8% of men had positive RT-PCR results compared to 2% of women (p=0.03) (Table 2). PEH tested at shelters had a higher percentage of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those tested in encampments (24% vs 8%, p=0.0002; Table 3). Neither RT-PCR nor antibody test results differed significantly by race or ethnicity. Conclusion. A greater percentage of PEH tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies at shelters than encampments, suggesting that continued assessment of mitigation strategies in shelters should be a priority.

We report epidemiologic data from a study investigating a cohort of women who became pregnant just before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11-13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples. COVID-19 cumulative incidence during the first trimester was of 10.1% with high prevalence of asymptomatic patients (42.8%). Similar to the course of the disease in non pregnant adults, 80% to 90% of infections were not severe.The prevalence of reported symptoms was four-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (57%) than in those negative (13%) (P <.001), suggesting that direct self-testing should open doors to confirmatory testing for COVID-19. Our findings support the need for COVID-19 screening in early pregnancy in epidemic areas to plan materno-fetal health surveillance programs.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,1,537-540,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26267,2005677498,#99318,Cosma 2021,,,1,0.250774097
"Point-of-care, in-home SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing to assess seroprevalence in at-risk health care workers","Meissner, Eric G.; Litwin, Christine; Crocker, Tricia; Mack, Elizabeth; Card, Lauren ","Background: Health care workers are at significant risk for infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): We utilized a point-of-care, lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (RayBiotech) to conduct a seroprevalence study in a cohort of at-risk health care workers (n=339) and normal-risk controls (n=100) employed at an academic medical center. To minimize exposure risk while conducting the study, consents were performed electronically, tests were mailed and then self-administered at home using finger stick blood, and subjects uploaded a picture of the test result while answering an electronic questionnaire. We also validated the assay using de-identified serum samples from patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result(s): Between April 14th and May 6th 2020, 439 subjects were enrolled. Subjects were 68% female, 93% white, and most were physicians (38%) and nurses (27%). In addition, 37% had at least 1 respiratory symptom in the prior month, 34% had cared for a patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, 57% and 23% were worried about exposure at work or in the community, respectively, and 5 reported prior documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. On initial testing, 3 subjects had a positive IgG test, 336 had a negative test, and 87 had an inconclusive result. Of those with an inconclusive result who conducted a repeat test (85%), 96% had a negative result. All 3 positive IgG tests were in subjects reporting prior documented infection. Laboratory validation showed that of those with PCR-proven infection more than 13 days prior, 23/30 were IgG positive (76% sensitivity), whereas 1/26 with a negative prior PCR test were seropositive (95% specificity). Repeat longitudinal serologic testing every 30 days for up to 4 times is currently in progress. Conclusion(s): We conducted a contact-free study in the setting of a pandemic to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in an at-risk group of health care workers. The only subjects found to be IgG positive were those with prior documented infection, even though a substantial proportion of subjects reported significant potential occupational or community exposure and symptoms that were potentially compatible with SARS-COV-2 infection.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S297,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.653,634731887,#98921,Meissner 2020,,,1,0.885172412
Lack of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion after prompt identification and cohorting of sentinel SARS-CoV-2-positive residents in a skilled nursing facility,"Bhattacharya, Debika; Fulcher, Jennifer A.; Schwartzman, William A.; Beenhouwer, David O.; Winnett, Alexander; Sohn, Linda; Calub, Feliza; Lee-Chang, Ian; Vallone, John; Graber, Christopher J.; Goetz, Matthew B. ","Background: Despite numerous outbreaks, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) are not well described. We reviewed serological test results in a cohort of SNF residents who had been repetitively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Method(s): In late March 2019, we identified symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents at a SNF. In response, all remaining SNF patients were serially screened, and all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were transferred to the acute care hospital or cohorted in a separate COVID Recovery Unit (CRU) in the SNF. In early June, all SNF residents (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative) underwent serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1/S2) IgG (DiaSorin). DiaSorin IgG-positive results for patients that were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative were reflexed to nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott). Antibody testing occurred a median of 69 days (63-70 IQR) after PCR positivity. Result(s): Nineteen SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents were identified from the outbreak and an additional 9 were transferred from the acute care hospital to the CRU; 1 died and 1 received convalescent plasma leaving 26 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents, including 6 who were asymptomatic, that were eligible for serologic testing. Twenty-four of the 26 were positive for IgG by the DiaSorin assay; one seronegative resident was one of the asymptomatic residents. There were an additional 121 residents in the SNF whose SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative at least once. Among these 121 SNF residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all but two were seronegative by the Diasorin assay. The two seropositive residents had no nucleocapsid antibodies when reflex tested by the Abbott assay. Conclusion(s): In a limited sample of SNF residents with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, the sensitivity of the Diasorin assay was 92% (24/26) and the specificity was 98% (119/121). None of the residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR had confirmed positive antibody results using reflex testing (DiaSorin/Abbott). Despite high risk exposure in congregate living facilities, we found no evidence of additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure, reinforcing the importance of serial surveillance SARS-CoV-2 testing and early cohorting in SNF settings.

Responding to the pandemic, multi-agency collaborative partnerships put in place actions integrating point-of-care antibody testing at established large-scale COVID-19 testing sites where the baseline seropositivity of COVID-19 in health care workers and first responders in Florida at the start of the pandemic was established., Purpose: Determine the seropositivity of healthcare workers and first responders at five drive thru testing sites using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in Florida from May 6 through June 3, 2020., Methods: The first drive-thru SARS-CoV-2 antibody test site was opened at Miami Hard Rock Stadium, May 6, 2020. Testing expanded to three additional sites on May 9, 2020: Jacksonville, Orlando, and Palm Beach. The fifth and final site, Miami Beach, began testing on May 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and first responder's self-seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing were designated for antibody testing and completed a laboratory collection form onsite for the point-of-care test. All testing was performed on whole blood specimens (obtained by venipuncture) using the Cellex Inc. qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. Seropositivity was assessed by univariate analysis and by logistic regression including the covariates age, sex, race/ethnicity, and testing location., Results and Discussion: As of June 3, 2020, of 5,779 healthcare workers and first responders tested, 4.1% were seropositive (range 2.6-8.2%). SARS-COV-2 antibody tests had higher odds of being positive for persons testing at the Miami Hard Rock Stadium (aOR 2.24 [95% C.I. 1.48-3.39]), persons of Haitian/Creole ethnicity (aOR 3.28 [95% C.I. 1.23-8.72]), Hispanic/Latino(a) ethnicity (aOR 2.17 [95% C.I. 1.50-3.13], and Black non-Hispanic persons (aOR 1.63 [95% C.I. 1.08-2.46]).

Health Care Acquired COVID-19 is Less Symptomatic than Community Acquired Disease Among Healthcare Workers.,"Fletcher, Jeffrey J; Feucht, Eric C; Hahn, Peter Y; McGoff, Theresa N; Dehart, Del J; El Mortada, Mohamad E; Grifka, Ronald G","OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized healthcare workers (HCW) with high-risk exposures outside the healthcare system would have less asymptomatic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and more symptoms than those without such exposures., DESIGN: A longitudinal point prevalence study during August 17- September 4 2020 and December 2nd - 23rd., SETTING: Community based teaching health system., PARTICIPANTS: All HCS were invited to participate. Among HCW who acquired COVID-19, logistic regression models were used to evaluate the adjusted odds of asymptomatic disease using high-risk exposure outside the healthcare system as the explanatory variable. The number of symptoms between exposure groups was evaluated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The risk of seropositivity among all HCS by work exposure was evaluated during both periods., INTERVENTIONS: Survey and serological testing., RESULT: Seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.2% - 2.6%) to 13.7% (95% CI 11.9% - 15.5%) during the study. Only during Period 2 did HCW with the highest work exposure (versus low exposure) have an increased risk of seropositivity (RD 7% [95% CI 1% -13%]). Participants who had a high-risk exposure outside of work (compared to those without) had a decreased probability of asymptomatic disease (OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.16 - 0.86]) and demonstrated more symptoms (median of 3 [IQR 5] vs 1 [IQR 2]; P = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Health care acquired COVID-19 increases the probability of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease compared to community acquired disease.

Individuals with isolated congenital GH deficiency due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation appear to cope better with SARS-CoV-2 infection than controls.,"Melo, Manuela A; Borges, Lysandro P; Salvatori, Roberto; Souza, Daniela R V; Santos-Junior, Hertz T; de R Neto, Jose M; Campos, Viviane C; Santos, Aryanne A; Oliveira, Carla R P; da Invencao, Grazielly B; Batista, Vanderlan O; Matos, Igor L S; Barros-Oliveira, Cynthia S; Dos Santos, Kezia A; Santos, Elenilde G; Souza, Nicolas A A; Melo, Enaldo V; Borges, Pamela C; Santos, Saulo E F S; de Oliveira, Brenda M; Oliveira-Santos, Alecia A; de Jesus, Amelia R; Aguiar-Oliveira, Manuel H","PURPOSE: Several interactions exist between the GH/IGF axis and the immune system, including effects on innate immunity and humoral and cellular response. Acquired GH deficiency (GHD) has been recently proposed as a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 infections. However, acquired GHD is often associated to other factors, including pituitary tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, and additional pituitary hormones deficits and their replacements, which, together, may hinder an accurate analysis of the relationship between GHD and COVID-19. Therefore, we decided to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the frequency of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in adults subjects with untreated isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous null mutation in the GHRH receptor gene., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 27 adult IGHD subjects and 27 age- and gender-matched local controls. Interview, physical examination, bio-impedance, hematological and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed., RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies between the two groups. Conversely, no IGHD individual had a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while 6 control subjects did (p = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: The production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was similar between IGHD subjects due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation and controls, but the evolution to symptomatic stages of the infection and the frequency of confirmed cases was lower in IGHD subjects than in GH sufficient individuals.",2021,/,Endocrine,,"9434444, CV9",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12020-021-02728-8,33860882,#98242,Melo 2021,,,1,0.790745134
Suboptimal personal protective equipment and SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nephrologists: a Spanish national survey.,"Quiroga, Borja; Sanchez-Alvarez, Emilio; Ortiz, Alberto; de Sequera, Patricia; Spanish Society of Nephrology","Background: Healthcare workers have been overexposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the current pandemic, but there is little information on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on nephrologists. The aim of this study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 infections in nephrologists in the first and second pandemic waves, describing risk factors and clinical features., Methods: This national survey was sent to Spanish nephrologists. Epidemiological data, comorbidities and medications were collected and compared between infected and non-infected nephrologists. Symptoms, prescribed treatments and outcomes are described for infected nephrologists., Results: Three hundred and twenty-seven nephrologists (66% female, age 46 +/- 11 years) completed the survey. Of them, 62 (19%) were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Infection was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the 37 symptomatic patients (62%) and by serological tests in 25 (38%) asymptomatic individuals. Five (8%) of the infected nephrologists were hospitalized. Contrary to the general population, most infections occurred during the first pandemic wave and, specifically, during the first month, when personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages were more severe. Factors associated with infection in univariate analysis were younger age (P = 0.004), work in non-nephrology departments (P = 0.045), higher exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 patients (P < 0.001), lack of appropriate PPE (P < 0.001) and non-O ABO blood group. In an adjusted multivariate model, only lack of appropriate PPE remained predictive of infection [hazard ratio 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.9-6.8), P < 0.0001]., Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was frequent among nephrologists, was frequently diagnosed late and was associated with working conditions.

Estimating asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a geographic area of low disease incidence.,"Caturano, Valeria; Manti, Barbara; Carbone, Fortunata; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Colicchio, Roberta; Capasso, Mario; Leonardi, Antonio; Matarese, Giuseppe; Russo, Tommaso; Salvatore, Paola","BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection. Today it is relatively easy to isolate Covid-19 symptomatic cases, while remains problematic to control the disease spread by infected but symptom-free individuals. The control of this possible path of contagion requires drastic measures of social distancing, which imply the suspension of most activities and generate economic and social issues. This study is aimed at estimating the percentage of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a geographic area with relatively low incidence of Covid-19., METHODS: Blood serum samples from 388 healthy volunteers were analyzed for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by using an ELISA assay based on recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein., RESULTS: We found that 7 out of 388 healthy volunteers, who declared no symptoms of Covid-19, like fever, cough, fatigue etc., in the preceding 5 months, have bona fide serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, that is 1.8% of the asymptomatic population (95% confidence interval: 0.69-2.91%)., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated range of asymptomatic individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG should be between 26,565 and 112, 350.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia,"Mahallawi, W. H.; Al-Zalabani, A. H.","Background: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%& ndash;21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Asymptomatic healthcare worker COVID-19 testing program,"Horton, Lucy E.; Taplitz, Randy; Torriani, Francesca J.; Abeles, Shira R.; Ikeda, Lydia; Ikeda, Tyson ","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains a major threat worldwide. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high infection rates reported from HCWs in hard-hit regions2,3, raising concerns about nosocomial infections and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in protecting HCWs. Asymptomatic infection is estimated 17.9% to 33.3%4 and is a common source of transmission5. We designed a HCW testing program to address patient and employee concerns about exposures in the healthcare setting at our 808-bed health system. During the time of employee testing, the mean (range) number of inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID was 30 (22-38) of a mean (range) daily census of 560 (492-602) (approximately 5.4%). Method(s): This opt-in program offered SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic HCWs with paired nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab for PCR (Roche) and serum IgG antibody testing (Diazyme). While initially designed as a pilot project in the Emergency Departments and COVID-19 units, it was quickly expanded to a health system-wide initiative. Result(s): From April 22 to June 2, PCR testing was performed on 5826 asymptomatic HCWs with four PCR tests resulting positive (0.09%). Of 5589 serologic tests (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) performed, 57 tested positive (1.02 %). All HCW with a positive IgG had a concurrent negative PCR. Conclusion(s): In this cross-sectional evaluation, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in asymptomatic HCWs at UC San Diego was less than 1%, supporting modeling estimations at the San Diego County level of very low levels of community exposure at the time of this testing. Further analyses of incidence rates and potential risk factors such as employee roles within the healthcare system, community and healthcare exposures, and home zip code are underway.

"SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN).","Hall, Victoria Jane; Foulkes, Sarah; Charlett, Andre; Atti, Ana; Monk, Edward J; Simmons, Ruth; Wellington, Edgar; Cole, Michelle J; Saei, Ayoub; Oguti, Blanche; Munro, Katie; Wallace, Sarah; Kirwan, Peter D; Shrotri, Madhumita; Vusirikala, Amoolya; Rokadiya, Sakib; Kall, Meaghan; Zambon, Maria; Ramsay, Mary; Brooks, Tim; Brown, Colin S; Chand, Meera A; Hopkins, Susan; SIREN Study Group","BACKGROUND: Increased understanding of whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection is an urgent requirement. We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection., METHODS: A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts., FINDINGS: From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7.6 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57.3 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0.159 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days., INTERPRETATION: A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care of the UK Government, Public Health England, The National Institute for Health Research, with contributions from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments.

Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in the US as of September 2020,"Bajema, Kristina L.; Wiegand, Ryan E.; Cuffe, Kendra; Patel, Sadhna V.; Lim, Travis; Havers, Fiona P.; Fry, Alicia M.; Hall, Aron J.; Gundlapalli, Adi V.; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Petersen, Lyle R.; Edens, Chris; Iachan, Ronaldo; Lee, Adam; Moyse, Davia; Harding, Lee; Martin, Kelly; Biel, Marjorie; Deng, Yangyang; Kyle, Tonja; Meyer, William A.; Mathur, Mohit ","Importance: Case-based surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection likely underestimates the true prevalence of infections. Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions. Objective(s): To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020. Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >=65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status. Result(s): Of 177919 serum samples tested, 103771 (58.3%) were from women, 26716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction. Biweekly nationwide testing of commercial clinical laboratory sera can play an important role in helping track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.Copyright Â© 2021 American Medical Association.

"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in health care workers at an academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts","Cole, Manisha; Kataria, Yachana; Duffy, Elizabeth; Perkins, Elissa; Pierre, Cassandra; Elizabeth Ragan, Christopher Andry; De La Cena, Kyle; Bouton, Tara; Werler, Martha; Jacobson, Karen ","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has infected over 124,813 and caused the deaths of at least 600 healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United States as of October 11th, 2020. Boston's surge was early April to mid- May, with as many as 237 COVID-19 positive patients admitted per day, a 50% rate. Seroprevalence studies are important since the proportion of individuals that are asymptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and this assessment could lead to understanding disease transmission rates. HCWs are in a high-risk setting. It is important to understand disease burden among this population as it can help identify areas of high risk and inform infection control policy to slow infection rates. We aim to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs at our Boston area hospital. Design(s): Eligible HCWs were over 18 years old and worked on campus during the surge. With IRB approval, subjects provided consent, and completed a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic, occupation, COVID exposure, and infection prevention measures by using REDCap database. Participants had their blood drawn between July 13th - 26th for qualitative COVID-19 IgG antibody testing. Analyses were performed by the clinical pathology laboratory , detecting IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein on EUA approved assay. Result(s): The HCWs overall seroprevalence rate was 5.45%. Participants that were seropositive were more likely to be younger, female, and non-smokers. Obese participants had significantly higher odds of being seropositive (OR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.25 - 3.32). Nurses (OR: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.64-3.08)) and patient facing allied health ((OR: 1.61 (95% CI: 0.74-4.22)) were more likely to be seropositive. 75.3% of participants with a positive RT-PCR test were seropositive, while 2% with a negative RT-PCR test were seropositive. 1.8% with no prior RT-PCR testing were seropositive. Seropositivity status was significantly associated with fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, myalgia, loss of appetite, smell and taste, and lack of physical distancing with co-workers. Conclusion(s): These results support efficacy of hand hygiene and PPE, highlighting the need to reinforce these practices when engaging with colleagues. Nurses and allied HCWs were more likely to be seropositive, likely due to frequency of exposure to positive patients or relaxed distancing among coworkers. This data suggests a higher prevalence of milder symptoms that do not always prompt caution or changes in daily activities.

"Frequency of symptoms and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Orleans, Louisiana","Feehan, Amy K.; Fort, Daniel; Price-Haywood, Eboni; Velasco, Cruz; Garcia Diaz, Julia; Sapp, Eric; Pevey, Dawn; Seoane, Leonardo ","Background: Individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who do not report symptoms throughout the course of infection (asymptomatic) or those who are asymptomatic when they first contract the virus (presymptomatic) are a major public health concern. However, few prevalence studies to date have targeted the question of asymptomatic frequency within a community. Method(s): A stratified, random sample of subjects were sent to testing sites to complete a verbal consent, survey, nasopharyngeal swab, and blood draw. Swabs were tested for active viral shedding (PCR) and blood was tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2. Disease progression and IgG antibody response Results: Of the 2,640 subjects, 24 (0.9%) were PCR-positive alone, 30 (1.1%) were PCR-positive and IgG-positive, and 129 (4.9%) were IgG-positive alone. Subjects who reported anosmia were 17 times more likely to test positive. Thirtyeight percent of subjects never experienced symptoms despite developing antibodies to the virus, and 75% did not experience symptoms in the early stage of infection. Rates of reported asymptomatic infection and comorbidities statistically significantly increased with age. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized study that pairs PCR and IgG serology that addresses asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing a high frequency of asymptomatic disease. More research is needed to clarify differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic disease.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based sample across all age categories., METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1,316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1,211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and due to uncertain estimates retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S., RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n=3,000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for ELISA's manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95%HDI 1.81-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95%CI, 0.00-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95%HDI, 0.40-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on November 11, 2020, was 4.06% (95%HDI, 2.97-5.16%) and on October 3, 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95%HDI, 3.18-5.47%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late-April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducting in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.

Sars-cov-2 seroprevalence among health care workers-a voluntary screening study in a regional medical center in southern germany,"Muller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Ruhnke, Michaela; Spranger, Mareike; Kaier, Klaus; Borde, Johannes P. ","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a potentially severe clinical manifestation, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and currently poses a worldwide challenge. Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of any health care system and thus especially at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their potentially frequent and close contact with patients suffering from COVID-19. Serum samples from 198 HCWs with direct patient contact of a regional medical center and several outpatient facilities were collected during the early phase of the pandemic (April 2020) and tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Commercially available IgA-and IgG-specific ELISAs were used as screening technique, followed by an in-house neutralization assay for confirmation. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in seven of 198 (3.5%) tested HCWs. There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between the regional medical center (3.4%) and the outpatient institution (5%). The overall seroprevalence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in HCWs in both a large regional medical center and a small outpatient institution was low (3.5%) at the beginning of April 2020. The findings may indicate that the timely implemented preventive measures (strict hygiene protocols, personal protective equipment) were effective to protect from transmission of an airborne virus when only limited information on the pathogen was available.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

A.","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, dubbed COVID-19, has become one of the most serious challenges for human populations in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Rapid spreading and increased mortality related to it required new approaches to manage epidemic processes on a global scale. One of such approaches was based on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence associated with COVID-19. Our aim was to summarize the results on assessing seroprevalence to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (Nc) in residents from 26 regions of the Russian Federation, carried out during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and methods. Seroprevalence distribution was examined in 26 model regions of the Russian Federation according to the unified method developed by the Rospotrebnadzor with the participation of the Federal State Institution Saint Petersburg Pasteur Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Such approach implied formation of a group of volunteer subjects in model geographic region who were tested by ELISA for anti-Nc serum antibody level in peripheral blood. Analyzed primary data obtained in separate regions were either accepted for publication or released. Results. The current paper finalizes the data obtained in all 26 regions of the Russian Federation. The total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 19.5 (10.0-25.6)% with the maximum and minimum value found in the Kaliningrad Region and the Republic of Crimea, respectively (50.2% vs. 4.3%). A pattern of age-related seroprevalence distribution indicates insignificant predominance of seroprevalence among subjects of 1-17 years old: 22.1 (13.1-31.8)%. Among COVID-19 convalescents positive for SARS-CoV Nc antibodies it reached 60.0 (40.0-73.3)%. The number of contact persons comprised 6285 subjects or 8.5% of total volunteer cohort, with the level of seroprevalence reaching up to 25.3 (17.95-35.8)%. A direct correlation was revealed between levels of seroprevalence in convalescent and contact volunteers. In addition, the reproductive number for SARS-CoV was calculated comprising 5.8 (4.3-8.5) suggesting that one convalescent subject can infect at least 4 healthy individuals. A high level of asymptomatic forms of COVID-19 among seropositive subjects was confirmed empirically comprising up to 93.6 (87.1-94.9)%. Conclusion. A single cross-sectional study performed during 2020 June-August timeframe allowed to assess pattern of sex- and age-related COVID-19 seroprevalence for general population in 26 Russian Federation regions.

Using serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to conserve PCR tests in a resource constrained combat environment,"White, Brian K.; Nichols, Shawnn; Stuart, Rory P.; Rutherford, Ashley E.; Comes, Ryan; Cybulski, Daniel; Case, Alex M.; Sachdeva, Mohit; Bova, Jacob ","Background: In March 2020, COVID-19 threatened combat operations in Afghanistan. At that time, the NATO Resolute Support mission involved nearly 17,000 troops from 38 partner nations, plus civilians who support the mission, scattered throughout Afghanistan. While Afghanistan did not initially report many confirmed cases, large numbers of cases were reported from neighboring countries with known migration across the borders (sometimes thousands/day). Military medical leaders advised commanders regarding the potential health risks to the force, balancing with risks to the mission. Quarantine and isolation protocols were established. Public health interventions of social distancing, cloth mask wear, enhanced environmental cleaning, active case finding, and emphasis on hand hygiene and cough etiquette were enforced. However, many base locations were unable to alleviate close living quarters. Testing was identified as a means to assess risk to the population. Testing capabilities were limited, particularly PCR. When this testing strategy was established, the utilization and interpretation of antibody tests was quite controversial. With rapid antibody kits, the time to detection of both IgM and IgG are similar; detection of either cannot identify the time since exposure. Method(s): A novel surveillance plan was established whereby subpopulations at highest risk for exposure to the virus were screened with antibody tests from 17 Apr-1 Jun, 2020. High risk populations included: those leaving quarantine, base defense guards, isolation unit guards, medical personnel, dining facility workers, and those who interact with local populations. Individuals with detectable antibody (either IgM or IgG) were further evaluated with PCR tests. Result(s): In the first six weeks of this testing strategy, 1957 antibody tests were utilized. A total of 37 specimens were identified antibody positives with seroprevalence of 2% (Figure 1). Thirteen were identified to have positive IgG, 22 with IgM, and 2 with both. PCR was performed on those with detectable antibody, 13 (35%) had positive PCR. Conclusion(s): Serosurveillance of populations at high risk for exposure to the virus is a logical way to conserve testing resources in a constrained combat environment.

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling., METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included., RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0-10.8% vs. 33.8-75.7%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.",2021,/,Current medical research and opinion,,"dux, 0351014",1,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1914943,33836626,#97984,Moroni-Zentgraf 2021,,,1,0.956362873

Amongst these, 5 were also seropositive and 3 were positive with low amounts of virus. High amounts of virus and no antibodies (a characteristic for presymptomatic COVID-19) were present in 5 employees (1.3%)., CONCLUSIONS: Personnel providing home services for older persons appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2.

Serum IgG antibody testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in healthcare workers,"Juskowich, Joy J.; Dimachkie, Ziad; Sarwari, Arif R.; Lerfald, Nathan M.; Bhandari, Ruchi; Khakoo, Rashida A.; Fanning, Mary; Bage, Seyoum; Simmons, Matthew E.; Stanley, Jonathan E. ","Background: With the COVID-19 pandemic, many changes were made in healthcare institutions including but not limited to canceling elective surgeries, limiting face-to-face clinic visits, and implementing visitor restrictions. Phased reopening began at West Virginia University (WVU) Medicine on May 25, 2020. While preparing for transition, concern was raised regarding potential for more employee exposures to persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In West Virginia (WV), we did not get the predicted surge of SARS-CoV-2. Current cumulative percent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in WV is 2332 positives of 133,142 tests (1.75%). We provided appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including controlled air purifying respirators for all healthcare workers (HCW) caring for persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from the beginning. Policies requiring masks for all HCW and patients took effect on March 27, 2020 and April 29, 2020, respectively. We hypothesized that due to appropriate PPE use there would be no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in HCW working in high versus low risk areas. Method(s): Serum samples from 1042 randomly selected HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals, ranging from 170 to 690 beds with 121 cumulative SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at the time of the study, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG between May 26, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were characterized as high or low risk based on work location. Environmental services (EVS) workers were included but not risk-stratified. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, chronic medical conditions, symptoms, and exposures. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive in 9 of 1042 (0.86%) randomly selected HCW. Seroprevalence was lower in high risk 5/835 (0.60%) versus low risk 4/176 (2.27%) group. This was not statistically significant. No EVS workers tested positive 0/31 (0%). Of 9 HCW who tested positive, 2 had previously tested positive for SARSCoV- 2 PCR. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in a large sample of HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals was low (0.86%). Low seroprevalence among HCW in high risk areas may be related to appropriate PPE use. Seroprevalence in HCW not caring for patients with COVID-19 could be from community or other inadvertent exposure.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S316,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.694,634731676,#98901,Juskowich 2020,,,1,0.599401114

","Objective: Firefighter first responders and other emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have been among the highest risk healthcare workers for illness during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We sought to determine the rate of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and of acute asymptomatic infection among firefighter first responders in a single county with early exposure in the pandemic. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study of clinically active firefighters cross-trained as paramedics or EMTs in the fire departments of Santa Clara County, California. Firefighters without current symptoms were tested between June and August 2020. Our primary outcomes were rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab positivity for acute infection. We report cumulative incidence, participant characteristics with frequencies and proportions, and proportion positive and associated relative risk (with 95% confidence intervals). Result(s): We enrolled 983 out of 1339 eligible participants (response rate: 73.4%). Twenty-five participants (2.54%, 95% CI 1.65-3.73) tested positive for IgG antibodies and 9 (0.92%, 95% CI 0.42-1.73) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Our cumulative incidence, inclusive of self-reported prior positive PCR tests, was 34 (3.46%, 95% CI 2.41-4.80).

Method(s): All citizens above 10 years of age resident in five municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, were invited to participate in the study. Among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between 5 May and 15 May 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyser. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive results among the total number tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. Result(s): A total of 1402 participants were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least one symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those with seropositive results was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. Conclusion(s): The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was three-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially those of younger age, and people who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)",2021,/,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,27,4,633,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.11.013,2010369088,#98366,Stefanelli 2021,,,1,0.135658467
"COVID-19 prevalence among COVID-19 exposed health care workers at a tertiary care center in San Bernardino County, CA","Valenzuela, Kathleen Louise; Wilson, April; Veltman, Jennifer ","Background: We studied the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antibody and positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among high risk health care workers at Loma Linda University Health System (LLUHS) who voluntarily obtained SARS-CoV2 antibody testing, and if indicated, antigen testing. The study determined that there is a significant decrease in the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antigen among employees at LLUH compared to the community. Method(s): Employee Health and Occupational Medicine offered antibody testing to employees who were considered high risk, primarily working in the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) designated units. We tested 658 subjects' serum for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies via the Nirmidas Qualitative SARS-CoV2 test. 29 subjects with a positive antibody test were subsequently tested for the presence of serum SARS-CoV2 antigen via PCR. Result(s): There were 31 subjects who tested positive for IgM or IgG antibodies. 11 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG. 3 subjects had negative IgM with positive IgG. 15 patients had positive IgM and positive IgG. 2 subjects had positive IgM with negative IgG, were subsequently retested, and then found to have positive IgM and positive IgG. Of those 31 subjects with a positive antibody test, 2 were not tested for the COVID-19 antigen, 1 had an inconclusive test, 23 tested negative, and 5 tested positive. Of those 5 positive for the antigen, 2 had symptoms and 3 did not report symptoms or did not use the symptom questionnaire. The community prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen in San Bernardino is 0.37%, as of June 16. The prevalence of positive SARS-CoV2 antigen among LLUH employees is 0.03% and the prevalence of positive antibody is 0.18%. The value of z is -7.3206, p is < .00001. Thus, the result is significant at p < .01. Conclusion(s): The results of this testing supports the efficacy of the early protective measures that LLUHS implemented in preparation for the pandemic. Such protective measures include: mandated face masks, symptoms screening, testing for SARS-CoV2 antibody or antigen on patients admitted, a dedicated COVID-19 section of the emergency department as well as inpatient units, etc. Given the statistical significance of this study, the protective bundle can be used as a template for preventative measures for future pandemics.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S291,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.640,634731629,#98896,Valenzuela 2020,,,1,0.437786731

Blood Samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasophareangeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed., RESULTS: the study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population, and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different than prevalence in Israel on 4th May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759, respectively). Serologic tests were done in 242 patients, 5 were found positive pointing to a seroprevalence of 2.07%. Exposure to a known COVID-19 patient was the only significant risk factor for being positive by swab or by serology. AI diagnosis, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, hydroxychloroquine did not influence the risk., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of rheumatologic patients was similar to that of the general population. Mild/asymptomatic cases may be prevalent according to serologic tests. The major risk factor for infection is exposure to a known case of COVID-19, immunosuppression did not play a role in the risk of infection. This article is protected by copyright.

We investigated an initially unnoticed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak linked to schools in northern France, beginning as early as mid-January 2020.AimsThis retrospective observational study documents the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, linked to an affected high school (n = 664 participants) and primary schools (n = 1,340 study participants), in the context of unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 circulation and limited control measures. Methods Between 30 March and 30 April 2020, all school staff, as well as pupils and their parents and relatives were invited for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and to complete a questionnaire covering symptom history since 13 January 2020. Results In the high school, infection attack rates were 38.1% (91/239), 43.4% (23/53), and 59.3% (16/27), in pupils, teachers, and non-teaching staff respectively vs 10.1% (23/228) and 12.0% (14/117) in the pupils' parents and relatives (p < 0.001). Among the six primary schools, three children attending separate schools at the outbreak start, while symptomatic, might have introduced SARS-CoV-2 there, but symptomatic secondary cases related to them could not be definitely identified. In the primary schools overall, antibody prevalence in pupils sharing classes with symptomatic cases was higher than in pupils from other classes: 15/65 (23.1%) vs 30/445 (6.7%) (p < 0.001). Among 46 SARS-CoV-2 seropositive pupils < 12 years old, 20 were asymptomatic. Whether past HKU1 and OC43 seasonal coronavirus infection protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection in 6-11 year olds could not be inferred.

Laboratory correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the U.S.,"Anand, Shuchi; Montez-Rath, Maria E; Han, Jialin; Garcia, Pablo; Bozeman, Julie; Kerschmann, Russell; Beyer, Paul; Parsonnet, Julie; Chertow, Glenn M","Patients on dialysis are at high risk for death due to COVID-19, yet a significant proportion do survive as evidenced by presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 8% of patients in the U.S. in July 2020. It is unclear whether patients with seropositivity represent the subgroup with robust health status, who would be more likely to mount a durable antibody response. Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health. In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value. Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL. Odds of seropositivity for serum creatinine 5 and 8 mg/dL were 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 12.5 mg/dL.

However, scant data are available on the issue. The aim of this study is to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and determinants in a sample of dentists, dental hygienists, and other personnel employed among the dental staff in Lombardy region. We used an accurate rapid diagnostic test kit detecting immunoglobulins (Ig) in 504 adults. Of the 499 participants who obtained a valid antibody test, 54 (10.8%) had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test (0.4% IgM+, 1.8% both IgM+ and IgG+, and 8.6% IgG+). A statistically significant association with infection was found for geographic area (compared to Milan, adjusted odds ratio was 2.79, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-7.68 for eastern and 2.82, 95% CI: 1.34-5.94, for southern Lombardy). The clinical staff did not result positive to SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than the administrative staff. This is the first study using antibody test in the dental staff personnel.

Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. Implications for Practice: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.Copyright Â© 2020 AlphaMed Press",2021,/,Oncologist,26,4,341-347,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/onco.13654,2010148502,#97058,Zambelli 2021,,,1,0.028359635

The aim of this observational, prospective study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies in solid cancer patients referred to the academic institution of the Marche Region, Italy, between 1 July and 26 October 2020 and to determine the accuracy of the rapid serological test. After performing 3767 GCCOV-402a rapid serological tests on a total of 949 patients, seroconversion was initially observed in 13 patients (1.4%). Ten (77% of the total positive) were IgG-positive, 1 (8%) were IgM-positive and 2 (15%) IgM-positive/IgG-positive. However, only 7 out of 13 were confirmed as positive at the reference serological test (true positives), thus seroprevalence after cross-checking was 0.7%. No false negatives were reported. The kappa value of the consistency analysis was 0.71. Due to rapid serological test high false positive rate, its role in assessing seroconversion rate is limited, and the standard serological tests should remain the gold standard.

We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and positive nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in German intensive care and emergency physicians. Physicians attending intensive care and emergency medicine training courses between June 16th and July 2nd 2020 answered a questionnaire and were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via automated electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay. We recruited 516 physicans from all parts of Germany, 445/516 (86%) worked in high risk areas, and 379/516 (73%) had treated patients with COVID-19. The overall positive rate was 18/516 (3.5%), 16/18 (89%) had antibodies against SARS-COV-2, another 2 reported previous positive RT-PCR results although antibody testing was negative. Of those positive, 7/18 (39%) were unaware of their infection.

This study evaluated the epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents of the biggest urban multiethnic indigenous community of the Amazonas state, Brazil. <h4>Methods</h4> Blood samples of 280 indigenous people who live in the urban community known as Parque das Tribos, which is located in the surrounding area of Manaus, were tested for the presence of anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An epidemiological standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire was applied to assess the risk factors and sociodemographic information of the study population. <h4>Results</h4> We found a total positivity rate of 64.64% (95% CI 59.01-70.28) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgA and IgG were detected in 55.71% (95% CI 49.89-61.54) and 60.71% (95% CI 54.98-66.45) of the individuals tested, respectively. From the total number (n=280), 80.11% of positive individuals (95%; CI 74.24-85.98) were positive for both IgA and IgG Abs. All individuals with COVID-19-related symptoms on the day of blood collection (n=11) were positive for IgG, while IgA was detected in 84.61% (n=55) of individuals who had presented symptoms several weeks before the blood collection. Individuals aged 30-39 were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.58-1.03; p=0.033). People whose main source of information on COVID-19 was religious leaders or friends showed higher susceptibility to infection (PR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p=0.040). In addition, individuals who left home more frequently were at higher risk of infection (PR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p=0.048). Five or more individuals per household increased almost 5-fold the risk of virus transmission (Odds ratio [OR] 2.56; 95% CI; 1.09-6.01; p=0.019). Over 95% of the study population had no access to clean water and/or sanitation. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The disproportionate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the Parque das Tribos urban indigenous community might be driven by typical cultural behavior and socioeconomic inequalities.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies formed in response to the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 mRNA vaccine by commercial antibody tests,"Kanji, Jamil; Bailey, Ashley; Fenton, Jayne; Ling, Sean; Rivera, Rafael; Plitt, Sabrina; Sligl, Wendy; Taylor, Sean; Turnbull, LeeAnn; Tipples, Graham; Charlton, Carmen","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>PURPOSE</h4> With rapid approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect vaccine-induced antibodies with available high-throughput commercial assays is unknown. We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response. <h4>METHODS</h4> This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2 nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Liaison Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralising titers. <h4>RESULTS</h4> 225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years,; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p<0.05). Neutralising antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p<0.05). <h4>CONCLUSION</h4> Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralising antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting the majority of individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR307503,10.1101/2021.03.30.21254604,,#97319,Kanji 2021,,,1,0.131768108

Method(s): Blood donors referred to the first lockdown area in Lombardy Region and the neighbouring area were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific antibodies during the period 18 March to 24 June 2020. Serum samples were analysed using both a chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and a neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) assay. Result(s): In the period from 18 March to 24 June, 1922 blood donors were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 blood donors were tested in parallel with a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification was correlated with NT-Abs titres. In 78.2% of participants the NT-Abs titre was maintained, but in 15.8% it decreased by one four-fold dilution and in 6.0% it increased by one four-fold dilution. Conclusion(s): The duration of immunity of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the course of the pandemic and for this reason the monitoring of NT Abs is important.

Over the course of time, the progression in the number of clinical cases has appeared to be lower than expected, although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has been somewhat limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Congolese population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville who were willing to know their COVID-19 infection status. Method(s): Oropharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected from 754 healthy volunteers between April 2020 and July 2020. The samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative RT-PCR assay, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected using two different rapid tests. Result(s): A total of 56 participants (7.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 698 participants (92.6%) had negative RT-PCR results; of these, 117 were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. For these RT-PCR-negative subjects, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM was found to increase over time: from 1.7% and 2.5% in April, up to 14.2% and 17.6% in July, respectively. In April 2020, 5% of the women were found to have IgG or IgM antibodies, whereas the antibodies were not detected in any of the men. The seroprevalence in RT-PCR negative subjects was significantly higher in women within IgG (P = 0.012) and IgM (P = 0.045) over the first three months. Conclusion(s): The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors",2021,/,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,106,"(Batchi-Bouyou, Lobaloba Ingoba, Ndounga, Vouvoungui, Mfoutou Mapanguy, Boumpoutou, Ntoumi) Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Medicale (FCRM), Brazzaville, Congo(Batchi-Bouyou, Lobaloba Ingoba, Mfoutou Mapanguy, Ntoumi) Faculty of Sciences and Techno",07-Mar,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.065,2011576638,#97296,Ndounga 2021,,,1,0.121201407

We present results of consecutive population-based seroprevalence surveys performed in Denmark in 2020. <h4>Methods</h4> Invitation letters including a questionnaire covering symptoms were sent to representatively drawn samples of the population in spring, late summer and autumn/winter of 2020. Blood samples from participants taken at public test-centers were analyzed for total Ig and seroprevalence estimates per population segment calculated and compared to other surveillance parameters. <h4>Results</h4> From 34,081 participating individuals (response rate 33%), we obtained seroprevalence estimates increasing from 1.1% (95%CI: 0.7%â€“1.7) in May to 4.0 % (95%CI: 3.4%â€“4.7%) in December 2020. By December 2020, 1.5% of the population 12 years and older had tested positive by PCR. Seroprevalence estimates were roughly 3 times higher in those aged 12-29 compared to 65+ and higher in metropolitan municipalities. Among seropositives, loss of taste/smell were the more specific symptoms, 32%-56% did not report any symptoms. In half of seroconverted families, we did not see evidence of transmission between generations. Infected individuals in older age groups were hospitalized several fold more often than in younger. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Seroprevalence increased during 2020; younger age groups were primarily infected in the autumn/winter surge. Approximately half were asymptomatically infected. Denmark has a high per capita test rate; roughly two undiagnosed infections of COVID-19 were estimated to occur for each diagnosed case.

Coronavirus disease 2019 and first-trimester spontaneous abortion: a case-control study of 225 pregnant patients,"Cosma, Stefano; Carosso, Andrea R.; Borella, Fulvio; Carosso, Marco; Bovetti, Marialuisa; Benedetto, Chiara; Cusato, Jessica; Filippini, Claudia; D'Avolio, Antonio; Di Perri, Giovanni; Ghisetti, Valeria ","Background: The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 and classified as a global public health emergency. The evidence related to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy is limited to the second and third trimester of pregnancy, whereas data on the first trimester are scant. Many viral infections can be harmful to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of them is still unknown. Objective(s): With this study, we evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a risk factor for early pregnancy loss in the first trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, coronavirus disease 2019 course in the first trimester was assessed. Study Design: Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among pregnant women in their first trimester, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n=125). Current or past infection was determined by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swab and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies in a blood sample. Patient demographics, coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected. Result(s): Of 225 women, 23 (10.2%) had a positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (P=.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that coronavirus disease 2019 was not an independent predictor of early pregnancy loss (odds ratio, 1.28; confidence interval, 0.53-3.08). Coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms in the first trimester were fever, anosmia, ageusia, cough, arthralgia, and diarrhea; no cases of pneumonia or hospital admission owing to coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms were recorded. No difference in the incidence of symptoms was noted between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not seem to predispose to early pregnancy loss; its cumulative incidence did not differ between women with spontaneous abortion and women with ongoing pregnancy. Coronavirus disease 2019 appears to have a favorable maternal course at the beginning of pregnancy, consistent with what has been observed during the second and third trimesters.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,224,4,391,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.005,2008416732,#96757,Cosma 2021,,,1,0.782381432

Thus, information on the sero-status of nephrology personnel might be crucial for patient protection; however, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals., METHODS: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies among healthcare workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the the first peak phase of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein-based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay., RESULTS: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 20.4-31.5%) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about 2 weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8%) and IgM positivity in 6 (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. Of the healthcare workers 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0%) showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least 2 assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven COVID-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from healthcare workers did not show SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls., CONCLUSION: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among COVID-19 patients., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CONEC, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04347694.",2021,/,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,,"xop, 21620870r",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00508-021-01848-5,33835265,#96576,Reiter 2021,,,1,0.35292053

"Antibody titers and rapid antigen testing in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia vs. staff of ICU and ""Covid-19"" wards.","Epstude, Jorg; Skiba, Marcin; Harsch, Igor Alexander","Aim: The majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are older individuals. Age and the comorbidities typically associated with it usually go hand in hand with a less favorable course of the disease. We were interested in the antibody response in this particular patient group as well as in the results of rapid antigen testing. Methods: In 30 elderly patients (>75 years), antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured, and rapid antigen testing was determined about 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results were compared with those of a ""high-risk"" group consisting of ""Covid-19"" ward regular staff, as well as with ""low-risk"" staff consisting of members of the intensive care unit (ICU). The antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 was determined by ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company); for rapid antigen testing, we used the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test (Roche R). Results: Our investigations demonstrate a robust antibody response in the majority of elderly, comorbid patients about three weeks after the onset of infection. At this timepoint, most of the results of rapid antigen testing were negative. Furthermore, in the group of employees of our clinic (""Covid-19"" ward vs. the ICU staff), the prevalence of antibodies was very low and antigen testing was negative in the whole ICU group. Conclusion:  Although frequently comorbid, elderly patients are capable of significantly increasing antibodies against COVID-19 about 3 weeks after the onset of infection. Since the viral load can be assumed to have been low at that point, rapid antigen testing was negative in most cases. In the test group of employees of our clinic (""Covid-19"" ward vs. the ICU staff), the data demonstrate that - given adequate protective measures - the risk of infection is not higher in a ""Covid-19"" ward compared to other wards.

Two patients followed the COVID-19 restricted pathway, as they were considered positive while waiting for test results. Nine patients were hospitalized one night in the hospital. On admission to the hospital before surgery, at surgery, the day after surgery and at 7 and 30 days all patients and health-care personnel showed no symptoms and resulted negative at risks factors/exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and occurrence of COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing resulted not detectable in all patients and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantification showed IgG and IgM below the positive predicted value in 29 patients. One patient showed IgM above the cut-off of significance (1.21 and 1.03 preoperative and 1-month postoperative, respectively) that were considered irrelevant because of the absence of symptoms and exposure risks., CONCLUSIONS: The concept of donor emergency (i.e. short-term availability of transplant tissues), makes corneal transplantation an always-urgent activity because it is related to the availability of the corneal tissue from a donor.

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than ELISA (98% vs 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July-August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R=0.83, p<0.0001 and R=0.87, p<0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R=0.76, p=0.037). On repeat antibody testing three months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in gMFI of 62% vs 79% (p<0.01), for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the U.S. and globally.

COVID-19 infection among emergency department healthcare providers in a large tertiary academic medical center following the peak of the pandemic,"Murakami, E.; Ghatak-Roy, A.; Popova, M.; Gannon, C.; Park, D. E.; Villani, J.; Liu, C.; Toma, I.; Lafleur, J.","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread through the US during the last few months exposing healthcare providers to possible infection. Here we report testing of emergency department (ED) healthcare providers (HCP) for exposure to COVID-19 through lateral flow point of care (POC) and lab-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RTq-PCR for evidence of acute infection. 138 ED HCP were tested between May 26th (approximately one month after the peak of COVID-19 first wave of cases) and June 14th. Enrolled ED HCP represented about 70% of the total ED HCP workforce during the study period. Subjects were tested with a POC COVID-19 antibody test, and standard ELISA performed by a university based research lab. Subjects also provided a mid-turbinate swab and a saliva specimen for RTq-PCR. All subjects provided demographic information, past medical history, information about personal protective equipment (PPE) use, COVID-19 symptoms, as well as potential COVID-19 exposures during the previous 4 weeks, both in the ED, and outside the clinical setting. None of the HCP had positive RT-PCR results; 7 HCP (5%) had positive IgG for COVID-19; there was strong agreement between the lab-based ELISA (reference test) and the POC Ab test (P <= 0.0001). For the POC Ab test there were no false negatives and only one false positive among the 138 participants. There was no significant difference in demographic/ethnic variables, past medical history, hours worked in the ED, PPE use, or concerning exposures between seropositive and seronegative individuals. Moreover, there was no significant difference in reported symptoms between the two groups during the previous four weeks. The rate of COVID-19 seroconversion in our ED was 5% during the month following the pandemic's first wave. Based on questionnaire responses, differences in demographics/ethnicity, medical history, COVID-19 exposures, and PPE use were not associated with ED HCP having been infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the setting of our limited cohort of subjects the COVID-19 POC Ab test performed comparably to the ELISA lab-based standard. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in hemodialysis patients and protection against reinfection.,"Clarke, Candice L; Prendecki, Maria; Dhutia, Amrita; Gan, Jaslyn; Edwards, Claire; Prout, Virginia; Lightstone, Liz; Parker, Eleanor; Marchesin, Federica; Griffith, Megan; Charif, Rawya; Pickard, Graham; Cox, Alison; McClure, Myra; Tedder, Richard; Randell, Paul; Greathead, Louise; Guckian, Mary; McAdoo, Stephen P; Kelleher, Peter; Willicombe, Michelle","Patients with end stage kidney disease receiving in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following infection, patients receiving ICHD frequently develop circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, even with asymptomatic infection. Here, we investigated the durability and functionality of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients receiving ICHD. Three hundred and fifty-six such patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were regularly screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies, and those who became seronegative at six months were screened for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at time zero, of whom 127 also had detectable anti-RBD. Significantly, at six months, 71/111 (64.0%) and 99/116 (85.3%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive, respectively. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels were reduced significantly after six months. Eleven patients who were anti-NP seropositive at time zero, had no detectable antibody at six months; of whom eight were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at six months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following six months. Thus, patients receiving ICHD mount durable immune responses six months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with fewer than 3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity.

"SARS-CoV-2 prevalence associated to low socioeconomic status and overcrowding in an LMIC megacity: A population-based seroepidemiological survey in Lima, Peru.","Reyes-Vega, Mary F; Soto-Cabezas, M Gabriela; Cardenas, Fany; Martel, Kevin S; Valle, Andree; Valverde, Juan; Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Falcon, Maria Elena; Munayco, Cesar V; Peru COVID-19 Working Group","Background: Worldwide, Peru has one of the highest infection fatality rates of COVID-19, and its capital city, Lima, accumulates roughly 50% of diagnosed cases. Despite surveillance efforts to assess the extent of the pandemic, reported cases and deaths only capture a fraction of its impact due to COVID-19's broad clinical spectrum. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Lima, stratified by age, sex, region, socioeconomic status (SES), overcrowding, and symptoms., Methods: We conducted a multi-stage, population-based serosurvey in Lima, between June 28th and July 9th, 2020, after 115 days of the index case and after the first peak cases. We collected whole blood samples by finger-prick and applied a structured questionnaire. A point-of-care rapid serological test assessed IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted by sampling weights and test performance. Additionally, we performed RT-PCR molecular assays to seronegatives and estimated the infection prevalence., Findings: We enrolled 3212 participants from 797 households and 241 sample clusters from Lima in the analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 20.8% (95%CI 17.2-23.5), and the prevalence was 25.2% (95%CI 22.5-28.2). Seroprevalence was equally distributed by sex (aPR=0.96 [95%CI 0.85-1.09, p = 0.547]) and across all age groups, including >=60 versus <=11 years old (aPR=0.96 [95%CI 0.73-1.27, p = 0.783]). A gradual decrease in SES was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=3.41 [95%CI 1.90-6.12, p<0.001] in low SES). Also, a gradual increase in the overcrowding index was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=1.99 [95%CI 1.41-2.81, p<0.001] in the fourth quartile). Seroprevalence was also associated with contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case, whether a household member (48.9%, aPR=2.67 [95%CI 2.06-3.47, p<0.001]), other family members (27.3%, aPR=1.66 [95%CI 1.15-2.40, p = 0.008]) or a workmate (34.1%, aPR=2.26 [95%CI 1.53-3.35, p<0.001]). More than half of seropositive participants reported never having had symptoms (56.1%, 95% CI 49.7-62.3)., Interpretation: This first estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Lima shows an intense transmission scenario, despite the government's numerous interventions early established. Susceptibles across age groups show that physical distancing interventions must not be relaxed. SES and overcrowding households are associated with seroprevalence. This study highlights the importance of considering the existing social inequalities for implementing the response to control transmission in low- and middle-income countries.

We collected self-reported signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and compared this with serology results from two SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (Roche Elecsys R and EUROIMMUN)., RESULTS: Between 01 and 26 June, we recruited 2847 individuals (Stream A: 1,247, Stream B: 1,546 and Stream C: 154). Among those without previous positive PCR tests, 687/2,579 (26%) reported belief they had had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms; however, only 208 (30.3%) of these were seropositive on both immunoassays. Both immunoassays had high sensitivities relative to previous PCR positivity (>93%); there was also limited decline in antibody titres up to 110 days post symptom onset. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had differing symptom profiles and shorter illnesses than seropositive individuals., CONCLUSION: Non-COVID19 respiratory illness may have been mistaken for COVID-19 during the outbreak; laboratory testing is more specific than self-reported key worker beliefs in ascertaining past COVID-19 disease.

Method(s): This was a cross-sectional analysis of ED health care personnel in 20 geographically diverse university-affiliated EDs from May 13, to July 8, 2020, including case counts of prior laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnoses among all ED health care personnel, and then point-in-time serology (with confirmatory testing) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing in a sample of volunteers without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Health care staff were categorized as clinical (physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses) and nonclinical (clerks, social workers, and case managers). Previously undiagnosed infection was based on positive SARS-CoV-2 serology or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction result among health care personnel without prior diagnosis. Result(s): Diagnosed COVID-19 occurred in 2.8% of health care personnel (193/6,788), and the prevalence was similar for nonclinical and clinical staff (3.8% versus 2.7%; odds ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.2). Among 1,606 health care personnel without previously diagnosed COVID-19, 29 (1.8%) had evidence of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most (62%; 18/29) who were seropositive did not think they had been infected, 76% (19/25) recalled COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and 89% (17/19) continued to work while symptomatic. Accounting for both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections, 4.6% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 7.5%) of ED health care personnel were estimated to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 38% of those infections undiagnosed. Conclusion(s): In late spring and early summer 2020, the estimated prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was 4.6%, and greater than one third of infections were undiagnosed. Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection may pose substantial risk for transmission to other staff and patients.Copyright Â© 2021",2021,/,Annals of Emergency Medicine,,"(Mohr, Harland, Talan) Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, United States(Eyck) Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, Unit",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.12.007,2011480810,#94002,Mohr 2021,,,1,0.486895214

Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A multiple logistic regression model adjusting for ethnicity and social deprivation confirmed statistically significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses, and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk. Robust informatics solutions for HCW exposure data are essential to inform occupational monitoring.

We therefore aimed to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Munich general population after the first wave of the pandemic. For this purpose, we drew a representative sample of 2994 private households and invited household members 14 years and older to complete questionnaires and to provide blood samples. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was defined as Roche N pan-Ig >= 0.4218. We adjusted the prevalence for the sampling design, sensitivity, and specificity. We investigated risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and geospatial transmission patterns by generalized linear mixed models and permutation tests. Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was 1.82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-2.37%) as compared to 0.46% PCR-positive cases officially registered in Munich. Loss of the sense of smell or taste was associated with seropositivity (odds ratio (OR) 47.4; 95% CI 7.2-307.0) and infections clustered within households. By this first population-based study on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in a large German municipality not affected by a superspreading event, we could show that at least one in four cases in private households was reported and known to the health authorities.

Information on the number of people involved in Wuhan is still inadequate. This study aimed to describe the screening results of 61 437 community members in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Method(s): In mid-May 2020, Wuhan launched a population-scale city-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing campaign, which aimed to perform nucleic acid and viral antibody testing for citizens in Wuhan. Here we show the screening results of cluster sampling of 61 437 residents in Wuchang District, Wuhan, China. Result(s): A total of 1470 (2.39%, 95% CI 2.27-2.52) individuals were detected positive for at least one antiviral antibody. Among the positive individuals, 324 (0.53%, 95% CI 0.47-0.59) and 1200 (1.95%, 95% CI 1.85-2.07) were positive for immunoglobulin IgM and IgG, respectively, and 54 (0.08%, 95% CI 0.07-0.12) were positive for both antibodies. The positive rate of female carriers of antibodies was higher than those of male counterparts (male-to-female ratio of 0.75), especially in elderly citizens (ratio of 0.18 in 90+ age subgroup), indicating a sexual discrepancy in seroprevalence. In addition, viral nucleic acid detection using real-time PCR had showed 8 (0.013%, 95% CI 0.006-0.026) asymptomatic virus carriers. Discussion(s): The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was low. Most Wuhan residents are still susceptible to this virus.

Our first aim was to determine both the infection and seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the country's infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy., METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)- PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR COVID-19 testing.

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed., RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2-39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%-14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%-11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%-3.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.

Critical analysis of acute kidney injury in pediatric COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit.,"Raina, Rupesh; Chakraborty, Ronith; Mawby, Isabelle; Agarwal, Nirav; Sethi, Sidharth; Forbes, Michael","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is responsible for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic. Despite the vast research about the adult population, there has been little data collected on acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology, associated risk factors, treatments, and mortality in pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is a severe complication of COVID-19 among children and adolescents., METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Center Trials to find all published literature related to AKI in COVID-19 patients, including incidence and outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-four studies reporting the outcomes of interest were included. Across all studies, the overall sample size of COVID positive children was 1,247 and the median age of this population was 9.1 years old. Among COVID positive pediatric patients, there was an AKI incidence of 30.51%, with only 0.56% of these patients receiving KRT. The mortality was 2.55% among all COVID positive pediatric patients. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among COVID positive patients was 74.29%., CONCLUSION: AKI has shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult patients with COVID-19 and now also in the pediatric cohort with high incidence and mortality rates.

Patient's findings: Two female healthcare workers received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 3 days later, developed clinical manifestations of thyroid hyperactivity, with an increase thyroid hormone levels on thyroid function tests, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and elevated anti-thyroid-antibodies. Summary: Vaccines have been shown to trigger an immune response that leads to a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease. Our patients met the diagnostic criteria for ASIA; they were exposed to an adjuvant (vaccine), and they developed clinical manifestations of thyroid hyperfunction within a few days, with the appearance of anti-thyroid antibodies, despite being healthy prior to vaccination.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after symptom onset: impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China.,"Bushman, Mary; Worby, Colin; Chang, Hsiao-Han; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Hanage, William P","Nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as contact tracing and quarantine, have been the primary means of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, it remains uncertain which interventions are most effective at reducing transmission at the population level. Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift toward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. The observation that only one-third of transmission was presymptomatic at baseline, combined with the finding that NPIs reduced presymptomatic transmission by less than 20%, suggests that the overall impact of NPIs was driven in large part by reductions in transmission following symptom onset. This implies that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, are particularly important for control of SARS-CoV-2. Interventions which specifically reduce opportunities for presymptomatic transmission, such as quarantine of asymptomatic contacts, are likely to have smaller, but non-negligible, effects on overall transmission.",2021,/,European journal of epidemiology,,"ere, 8508062",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-021-00746-4,33881667,#101583,Bushman 2021,,,0,0.223434592

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of hospitalization and mode of in-hospital treatment of patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) before and during lockdown in the Campania region of Italy. The study population includes all patients with CLTI hospitalized in Campania over a 10-week period: 5 weeks before and 5 weeks during lockdown (n = 453). Patients were treated medically and/or underwent urgent revascularization and/or major amputation of the lower extremities. Mean age was 69.2 +/- 10.6 years and 27.6% of the patients were women. During hospitalization, 21.9% of patients were treated medically, 78.1% underwent revascularization, and 17.4% required amputations. In the weeks during the lockdown, a reduced rate of hospitalization for CLTI was observed compared with the weeks before lockdown (25 vs 74/100,000 inhabitants/year; incidence rate ratio: 0.34, 95% CI 0.32-0.37). This effect persisted to the end of the study period. An increased amputation rate in the weeks during lockdown was observed (29.3% vs 13.4%; p < 0.001). This study reports a reduced rate of CLTI-related hospitalization and an increased in-hospital amputation rate during lockdown in Campania. Ensuring appropriate treatment for patients with CLTI should be prioritized, even during disease containment measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar conditions.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.",2021,/,Vascular Medicine (United Kingdom),26,2,174-179,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1358863X20977678,2007629371,#102267,Stabile 2021,,,0,0.507267662
"POS-809 THE MOST COMMON PRESENTATION OF ESKD PATIENTS INFECTED WITH COVID-19, PRESENTED IN BALOCHISTAN INSTITUTE OF NEPHROLOGY AND UROLOGY QUETTA","RIND, H. ","Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is a highly contiguous and highly infective virus involving of every organ system of the body including kidneys, but the most severe presentation is with sever acute respiratory syndrome like symptoms and called (SARS-CoV-2). The rapidly spread of epidemics in China (Wuhan) reported in late December 2019 the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and becoming the global health emergency(1). Which had significant impact on people's health social activity behavior and on economic development. Reports to date indicates although majority of cases were mild and all ages are susceptible but a certain population develops critical illness like older age and with greater number of comorbid conditions and high morbidity and high mortality and poor outcomes(1). As mentioned above the Renal failure is sever medical condition with high prevalence (2)of other comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension including heart disease. Because the Dialysis populations majority are older and more susceptible and more likely at risk to deadly contiguous and to sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia then general population. Given these concern for higher risk of sever disease among patients receiving schedule dialysis, here we sought to examine the most common presentation, clinical course and outcomes of these patients population(3). Here we retrospectively presented the ESKD population with COVID-19 on dialysis admitted to our center. Method(s): We retrospectively collected the data of 21 patients on dialysis who were presented via emergency and via primary dialysis unit and were hospitalized up to June/2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data collected. The clinical data of survivors and non survivors were analyzed and compered. Result(s): In this case series, the data of 21 patients were collected retrospectically known case of ESRD with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 15(80%) males and 6(20%) female patients. The median age was 48year. The most common presentation in First week of illness was hypotension, short of breath, fever, cough and ARDS, laboratorial findings were Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, Radiological finding were unilateral 23.4%,and bilateral(multi lobar) infiltrates 76%. During the end of second week it was observed that the survivors were improving clinically and symptomatically. However patients with MODS showed persistent clinical worsening in second week of presentation with ARDS, drop in cardiac function may be viral myocarditis, and worsening vitally with more need of vasopressors support even double support, it was seen older age and comorbid were independent risk factor for illness, poor outcomes and death. 15(80%) patients died of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The thought is, there is associated immunosuppression condition in ESRD patients, patients with covid-19 are at higher risk of developing severity and progression to MODs and higher mortality compered to normal population. The most common presenting symptoms was short of breath and hypotension, which can be used as observational symptoms for covid-19 associated with ESRD and multi organ involvement.

21st century headache: mapping new territory,"Goadsby, Peter J.; Lanteri-Minet, Michel; Michel, Martin C.; Peres, Mario; Shibata, Mamoru; Straube, Andreas; Wijeratne, Tissa; Ebel-Bitoun, Caty; Constantin, Luminita; Hitier, Simon ","Background: With headache experienced by up to 75% of adults worldwide in the last year, primary headache disorders constitute a major public health problem, yet they remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. Headache prevalence and burden is changing as society evolves, with headache now occurring earlier in life. Contributing factors, mostly associated with changing life style, such as stress, bad posture, physical inactivity, sleep disturbance, poor diet and excess use of digital technology may be associated with the phenomenon that could be labelled as '21st century headache'. This is especially notable in workplace and learning environments where headache impacts mental clarity and therefore cognitive performance. The headache-related impact on productivity and absenteeism negatively influences an individual's behaviour and quality of life, and is also associated with a high economic cost. Since the majority of sufferers opt to self-treat rather than seek medical advice, substantial knowledge on headache prevalence, causation and burden is unknown globally. Mapping the entire population of headache sufferers can close this knowledge gap, leading to better headache management. The broad use of digital technology to gather real world data on headache triggers, burden and management strategies, in self-treated population will allow these sufferers to access appropriate support and medication, and therefore improve quality of life. Conclusion(s): These data can yield important insights into a substantial global healthcare issue and form the basis for improved patient awareness, professional education, clinical study design and drug development.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",2021,/,Journal of Headache and Pain,22,1,19,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10194-021-01233-7,2011041561,#101854,Goadsby 2021,,,0,0.218107957

","OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in comparison with a matched cohort with similar cardiovascular risk factors, as well as the impact of DVT/PE on hospital course. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on COVID-19 patients hospitalized from 03/11/2020 to 09/04/2020 was performed. Patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease with a cohort of non-COVID-19 patients. The primary end point was incidence of DVT/PE and odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary end point was hospitalization outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU days and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU days and LOH. RESULT(S): There were 13,310 patients with COVID-19 infection and 915 (6.9%) were hospitalized across our multi-site health care system. Mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8+/-17.0 years, 396 (43.3%) were female. There were 82 (9.0%) patients with DVT/PE diagnosis confirmed with ultrasound of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. Odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was higher than without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5/915] vs. 9.0% [82/915]; OR 18; 95% CI [8.0-51.2], p<0.001). Vascular risk factors were no different among COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (p=0.02), the need for ICU care (p<0.001), duration of ICU stay (p<0.001) and LOH (p<0.001) were higher in the DVT/PE cohort than in those without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, hemoglobin (Hb) (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.46-0.95], p=0.04) and D-dimer (OR 1.0, 95% CI [0.33-1.56], p=0.03) levels were associated with higher mortality; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (OR 1.1, 95% CI [1.00-1.12], p=0.03) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR 1.0, 95% CI [1.01-1.07], p=0.05) were associated with higher risk for ICU admission; IL-6 (OR 1.0, 95% CI [1.00-1.02], p=0.05) was associated with higher risk for rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, Hb (Coef -3.0, 95% CI [0.03-0.08], p=0.005) was associated with prolonged ICU stay; aPTT (Coef 2.0, 95% CI [0.003-0.006], p=0.05), international normalized ratio (INR) (Coef -3.2, 95% CI [0.06-0.19], p=0.002) and IL-6 (Coef 2.4, 95% CI [0.0011-0.0027], p=0.02) were associated with prolonged LOH. CONCLUSION(S): There is a significantly higher incidence of DVT/PE in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE are more likely to have higher mortality, require ICU care, prolonged ICU days and LOH compared with COVID-19 positive patients without DVT/PE.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation after pd-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma: A case report,"Cancela-Diez, B.; Sanchez-Argaiz, M.; Martinez-Casanova, N.; Sanchez-Yanez, E.; Moya-Carmona, I.; Gomez-Derueda, F. ","Background and importance Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent a milestone therapy in many types of cancer, such as melanoma. Nivolumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody with antitumour activity in melanoma. Only a few studies have investigated the relationship between ICIs and disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system. Aim and objectives To report a case of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in a metastatic melanoma patient treated with nivolumab. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with melanoma stage IB and resected in 2008. In December 2019, she relapsed (pulmonary and intracardiac metastasis). Then, she underwent treatment with nivolumab 240 mg/14 days, 14 cycles (last cycle 26 June 2020), with greater tumour partial response. During the last nivolumab cycles she had asthenia and thrombocytopenia and nivolumab was stopped. She was treated with methylprednisolone, but low platelet count persisted and she had extensive haematomas. She was admitted to hospital on 27 July due to probable DIC as an immune related adverse event (IrAE). Material and methods Laboratory tests on admission showed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (36x109L platelet count) and disordered coagulation (35 mg/dL fibrinogen, 75 468 ng/mL Ddimer). International normalised ratio for prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were in the normal range. PCR for SARS coronavirus screening and blood tests for mycobacteria were both negative. Results The patient was treated with fibrinogen. There was no evidence of tumoral progression or signs of infection. Furthermore, the patient had no history of other blood disorders, and there were no signs of trauma or sepsis. She was diagnosed with DIC related to nivolumab and she received gamma globulins, fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion with negative clinical evolution; so, she began treatment with infliximab and methylprednisolone pulse, without signs of bleeding, except for the persistence of haematomas and low levels of fibrinogen and platelets. The patient's condition deteriorated, and platelet count decreased despite therapy with fibrinogen, anticoagulants, transfusions of blood and antibiotic-antifungal therapy. Finally, the patient showed neurological damage related to cerebral haemorrhage due to the low platelet count and she died in hospital. Conclusion and relevance Disseminated intravascular coagulation had the highest proportion of death outcomes among the top 10 most frequently reported ICI associated haematological IrAEs. For this reason, clinicians need to be careful, paying special attention during ICI treatment. This case report suggests a direct relationship between immunotherapy and disorder coagulation events; however, this cannot always be demonstrated but the diagnosis was made by exclusion. Therefore, extensive research in relation to haematological IrAEs and ICIs are necessary.",2021,/,European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy,28,SUPPL 1,A130-A131,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-eahpconf.269,634721015,#98613,Cancela-Diez 2021,,,0,0.679100119

The current study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia among patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19. Patients who developed nosocomial candidemia were identified, and their clinical course was reported. A 1:3 case control matching was used to identify non-candidemia patients who served as controls. 89 patients were admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 during the study period. The incidence of nosocomial candidemia was 8.9% (n = 8). Case-control matching identified 24 patients with similar disease severity at the time of ICU admission. Median time to first isolation of yeast was 26 days. Candidemia patients reported longer median ICU stay than controls. (40 vs. 10 days, p =.004).

Vasoplegic shock in a young pediatric patient with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C),"Sallam, Mohammad; Parsrija, Divij; Alibrahim, Omar; Makvandi, Shayan ","INTRODUCTION: Since April 2020, multiple reports emerged from Europe and later from New York City of a presentation of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with different clinical patterns that occurs 1-6 weeks following SARS-CoV2 infection. MIS-C is associated with variable degrees of cardiac involvement. The median age of affected children is 8.5-10 years. METHOD(S): A previously healthy 16-month-old patient who presented with febrile seizure, diarrhea and generalized skin rash. Twelve hours later, patient had persistent fever (41C), skin rash and diarrhea with prominent physical findings of periorbital edema, hepatomegaly, skin rash and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Shortly after admission, patient developed vasoplegic shock and was therefore intubated and vasopressor support was initiated. Broad spectrum antibiotics were started. The diagnosis of MIS-C was established with high inflammatory markers, anemia, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated ferritin level, coagulopathy with significantly elevated D-dimers and positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. BNP was also elevated. Troponin level was within normal limit. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave changes and cardiac echocardiography showed mild atrioventricular (AV) valves' regurgitation that had no clinical significance and ultimately resolved. Patient received methylprednisolone with a maximum dose of 30mg/kg/day, anakinra with a maximum dose of 12m/kg/day, 2 doses of 1g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and Low molecular weight heparin. Patient remained intubated, mechanically ventilated and on vasopressors support for 3 days after which signs of hemodynamic stability were established and was subsequently extubated. RESULT(S): We successfully treated this patient who presented with shock and reversible AV valves regurgitation secondary to MIS-C in an uncommon age group compared to the recent reports. Our management approach was parallel to most institutions with IVIG, glucocorticoids, and interleukins receptor antagonists. The good outcome of this patient with MIS-C highlights the importance of early recognition of shock state, proper and judicious fluid resuscitation, early establishment of invasive monitoring, intubation and mechanical ventilation, and appropriate initiation of inotropes and vasopressors.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,40,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726340.54216.49,634767110,#101660,Sallam 2021,,,0,0.119555731

Convalescent plasma, a method of passive immunization that has been applied to prior viral pandemics, holds promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Immunocompromised patients may experience more benefit from convalescent plasma given underlying deficits in B and T cell immunity as well as contraindications to antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy. We describe our institutional experience with four immunosuppressed patients (two kidney transplant recipients, one lung transplant recipient, and one chronic myelogenous leukemia patient) treated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma through the Expanded Access Program (NCT 04338360). All patients clinically improved after administration (two fully recovered and two discharged to skilled nursing facilities) and none experienced a transfusion reaction. We also report the characteristics of convalescent plasma product from a local blood center including positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR in all samples tested. This preliminary evidence suggest that convalescent plasma may be safe among immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 and emphasizes the need for further data on the efficacy of convalescent plasma as either primary or adjunctive therapy for COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

COVID-19 and stroke-Understanding the relationship and adapting services. A global World Stroke Organisation perspective,"Markus, Hugh S.; Martins, Sheila ","A year ago the World Stroke Organisation (WSO) highlighted the enormous global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke care. In this review, we consider a year later where we are now, what the future holds, and what the long-term effects of the pandemic will be on stroke. Stroke occurs in about 1.4% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, who show an excess of large vessel occlusion and increased mortality. Despite this association, stroke presentations fell dramatically during the pandemic, although emerging data suggest that total stroke mortality may have risen with increased stroke deaths at home and in care homes. Strategies and guidelines have been developed to adapt stroke services worldwide, and protect healthcare workers. Adaptations include increasing use of telemedicine for all aspects of stroke care. The pandemic is exacerbating already marked global inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality.

POS-738 SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION IN PEDIATRIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS DURING EARLY AND LATE POST-TRANSPLANT PERIOD: A SINGLE-CENTER REPORT OF 2 CASES,"KARAVA, V.; Kondou, A.; Dotis, I.; Printza, N.; Miserlis, G.; Antoniadis, N. ","Introduction: Adult kidney transplant (KT) recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are susceptible to a more serious COVID-19 disease compared to immunocompetent patients, including more severe pneumonia, longer duration of illness and worse patient prognosis. Moreover, a high risk of allograft damage, possibly leading to allograft loss, has been reported. In contrast, data regarding the clinical course of infected pediatric KT recipients are scarce. Herein, we describe the clinical features, management and outcome of 2 deceased-donor KT pediatric recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurred during early and late post-transplant period. Method(s): The two cases concerned a 13-year-old boy with Senior-Loken syndrome and an 18-year-old girl, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, who received KT 3 months and 7 years before SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively. The boy had received induction therapy with basiliximab, followed by triple maintenance therapy, including oral cyclosporine (70 mg twice per day), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (500 mg twice per day) and daily methylprednisolone (10 mg), while the girl's current immunosuppressive treatment consisted in tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), MMF (750 mg twice per day) and methylprednisolone (8 mg) every other day. Allograft function was stable in both patients. Result(s): Close contact with confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in both patients. The boy was asymptomatic, while the girl presented sore throat, tiredness and fever with maximum temperature 38.6 C, which lasted for 48 hours. Chest X-ray was normal in both patients. Initial laboratory findings were common in both patients and included mild lymphocytopenia (920/muL and 868/muL respectively), normal C-reactive protein and liver enzyme levels, and stable serum creatinine and urea levels. MMF was discontinued, while steroid dose was increased by twice in both patients. Due to fever, a 3-day course of azithromycin was administered to the female patient. Normalization of total lymphocyte count permitting the progressive re-initialization of MMF and reduction of steroid dose was observed at 14th and 5th day of the disease respectively. Graft function remained stable in both patients. Conclusion(s): The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both early and late post-transplant period seems favorable in pediatric KT recipients. Immunosuppression interruption may be beneficial for preventing acute disease complications. Optimal treatment strategies need to be established.

Twenty-three out of the 42 patients evaluated were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Vascular and extravascular findings were categorized into ""relevant"" or ""other/incidental,"" first referring to the need for immediate patient care and management. Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher exact test was used to compare study groups, where appropriate., RESULTS: Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of cases (n = 30). Pulmonary embolism was the most frequent in both ICU and non-ICU cases (56.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.002). Ischemic infarctions at several sites such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney were detected (n = 20), with multi-site involvement in some cases. Systemic venous thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of cases compared to 7.1% of systemic arterial events, the first being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the study population, with no significant differences in ICU and non-ICU patients., CONCLUSIONS: Vascular involvement is not negligible in COVID-19 and should be carefully investigated as it may significantly affect disease behavior and prognosis., KEY POINTS: * Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of the study population, with pulmonary embolism being the most frequent event in ICU and non-ICU cases. * Apart from the lung, other organs such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidneys were involved with episodes of ischemic infarction. Systemic venous and arterial thrombosis occurred in 30.9% and 7.1% of cases, respectively, with venous events being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). * Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the whole population.",2021,/,European radiology,,"cl3, 9114774",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07904-y,33864140,#101437,Rea 2021,,,0,0.389814602
Processing of the human coronavirus 229E replicase polyproteins by the virus-encoded 3C-like proteinase: Identification of proteolytic products and cleavage sites common to pp1a and pp1ab,"Siddell, Stuart G.; Ziebuhr, John ","Replicase gene expression by the human coronavirus 229E involves the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Experimental evidence suggests that these precursor molecules are subject to extensive proteolytic processing. In this study, we show that a chymotrypsin-like enzyme, the virus-encoded 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)), cleaves within a common region of pp1a and pp1ab (amino acids 3490 to 4068) at four sites. trans-cleavage assays revealed that polypeptides of 5, 23, 12, and 16 kDa are processed from pp1a/pp1ab by proteolysis of the peptide bonds Q3546/S3547, Q3629/S3630, Q3824/N3825, and Q3933/A3934. Relative rate constants for the 3CL(pro)- mediated cleavages Q2965/A2966, Q3267/S3268, Q3824/N3825, and Q3933/A3934 were derived by competition experiments using synthetic peptides and recombinant 3CL(pro). The results indicate that coronavirus cleavage sites differ significantly with regard to their susceptibilities to proteolysis by 3CL(pro). Finally, immunoprecipitation with specific rabbit antisera was used to detect the pp1a/pp1ab processing end products in virus-infected cells, and immunofluorescence data that suggest an association of these polypeptides with intracellular membranes were obtained.",1999,/,Journal of Virology,73,1,177-185,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jvi.73.1.177-185.1999,28565359,#99345,Siddell 1999,,,0,0.880272862
"Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptorACE2 in human heart is associated with uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, and activation of the renin angiotensin system.","Herman-Edelstein, Michal; Guetta, Tali; Barnea, Amir; Waldman, Maayan; Ben-Dor, Naomi; Barak, Yaron; Kornowski, Ran; Arad, Michael; Hochhauser, Edith; Aravot, Dan","BACKGROUND: Diabetic and obese patients are at higher risk of severe disease and cardiac injury in corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice., METHODS: Right atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested., RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment., CONCLUSION: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection. Since ACEi or ARBs show no effect on ACE2 expression in the heart further support their safety.",2021,/,Cardiovascular diabetology,20,1,90,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01275-w,33906662,#103660,Herman-Edelstein 2021,,,0,0.262856114

Thus, we assessed the effect of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccinesâ€™ two-dose (2D) regimen on humoral responses in immunocompromised lung transplant (LT) recipients. About 25% (18/73) of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected-LT patients generated positive spike-IgG response following 2D of vaccines, with 36% (9/25) in the Moderna cohort and only 19% (9/48) in the Pfizer cohort. 2D in LT patients elicited significantly lesser median IgG SP response (1.7 AU/mL, 95% CI: 0.6-7.5 AU/mL) compared to non-transplanted, uninfected naÃ¯ve subjects (14209 AU/mL, 95% CI: 11261-18836 AU/mL) (p<0.0001).

Modeling of COVID-19 with limited public health resources: a comparative study of three most affected countries.,"Srivastav, Akhil Kumar; Ghosh, Mini; Bandekar, Shraddha Ramdas","COVID-19 has become a deadly pandemic in the recent times claiming millions of lives worldwide in a grievous manner. Most of the countries in the world have limited number of medical resources (hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.), and in the case of large outbreak, it becomes very difficult to provide treatment to every infected individual. In this study, we propound a mathematical model where we classify the infected into two subcategories-asymptomatic and symptomatic. This model further accounts for the effect of limited medical resource for infected people and using face masks in combating the pandemic. Focusing on these aspects, we analyze the model and exploit the available data for assessing the pattern in three most affected countries, namely USA, India and Brazil. The developed model is calibrated to fit data for these three countries and estimate the transmission rate of symptomatic, asymptomatic individuals. The rate at which the individuals who are quarantined recover is estimated as well. Along with these estimations, a comparative study based on the basic reproduction number estimated for the three countries is presented. Standard methods of sensitivity analysis are performed to analyze the ways in which basic reproduction number is impacted upon due to changes in different parameters of the model. Further, we obtain disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the model. It is observed that backward bifurcation occurs if the capacity of treatment is small and bistable equilibria are shown that makes the system more sensitive to the initial conditions. Sufficient conditions for the local asymptomatic stability of the endemic equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium of the system are obtained. The results of this study imply that to curb the severity of the increasing cases of the disease in these countries, effective strategies to control disease spread should be implemented so that the basic reproduction number can be decreased below the threshold value which is certainly less than unity. The use of protective masks in public is shown to be an important preventive measure to lower disease transmission rate. Also, the quantity of medical resources should increase so that every infected person can get better treatment.

"Recovery from COVID19 is associated with an increase in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells during the course of disease","Hussein, Shafinaz; Croken, Matthew; El Jamal, Siraj; Khattar, Pallavi; Dembitzer, Francine ","Background: The COVID19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (SARS). The majority of individuals with COVID19 are asymptomatic or experience mild disease, however, a subset of patients develop serious respiratory illness. Lymphopenia, primarily affecting T-cells, is a characteristic hematologic finding associated with severe disease. Here, we characterize the changes in T-, B-, and NK-cell subsets during the disease course to determine if any have predictive value. Design(s): The pathology database was utilized to identify hospitalized patients >18 years of age with SARS infection determined by PCR testing of nasal swab. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for T-, B- and NK-cell subsets using Beckman Coulter AQUIOS Flow Cytometry System. The antibody panels were CD45/CD4/CD8/CD3 and CD45/CD16+56/CD19/CD3. Lymphocyte subset analyses were performed every 2-5 days until SARS PCR negativity, hospital discharge, or death. Disease severity was defined as follows: mild disease: SpO2>94% AND no pneumonia on imaging; moderate disease: SpO2<94% OR pneumonia on imaging; severe disease: high flow nasal cannula, non-rebreather mask, BIPAP or mechanical ventilation support. Complete blood counts with differential, IL6 and IL8 levels, and ABO/Rh blood type were recorded. Linear regression analysis was performed for each laboratory metric. Result(s): 33 hospitalized patients (17 males, 16 females, age range 34-93 years, median 68 years) were included in the study. 7 patients were asymptomatic or had mild disease, 13 had moderate disease, and 13 had severe disease. 24 patients recovered, and 9 patients died. There were no readmissions for COVID19. The median absolute CD3 level ranged from 496-1509 count/uL in asymptomatic/mild patients; 291-1284 count/uL in patients with moderate disease and 67-816 count/uL in patients with severe disease. Patients who recovered had an increase in absolute CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ counts during the course of hospitalization. Absolute B- and NK-cells trended upwards in both survivors and non-survivors, with no difference in median slope in either group. There was a downward trend in IL6 and IL8 levels in surviving patients. Conclusion(s): Recovery from COVID19 is associated with an increase in absolute CD3+ T-cells. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets increased over time in survivors. Lymphocyte subset analysis and increasing CD3/CD4/CD8 T-cells during disease course may be useful predictors in COVID19 infection.

The effect of vitamin d level on COVID-19 severity in older adults,"Deland, O.; Parulekar, M. ","BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis in clinical medicine, public health, and politics, the ramifications of which may not be fully clear yet. Retrospective analyses have been performed for identification of risk factors for development of severe symptoms, and vitamin D deficiency presents a promising target as an easily measurable and modifiable risk factor. There are data to suggest that vitamin D deficiency carries a greater risk for more severe COVID-19 disease, but data are lacking specifically within the geriatric population, a large and vulnerable group. Methods We performed retrospective analysis of patients 65 and above with a positive COVID-19 PCR and a serum 25-OH vitamin D level. 30-day mortality was used as a primary outcome. Severity of disease was characterized by serum biomarkers associated with poor clinical endpoints. The Shapiro-Wilk test was to assess normality of continuous variables. For bivariate analyses, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continuous variables, and the chi-square test for categorical variables. To adjust for comorbidities, multivariable analyses were conducted using exact logistic regression if the outcome was binary and rank regression if the outcome was continuous. Results Data was collected on 106 patients with COVID-19. The median age was 77, 62% of the population was female, and the median BMI was 27.2kg/m2. Comorbidities were prevalent in the sample with diabetes in 51%, hypertension in 92% and one-third having cancer. The number of patients classified as vitamin D deficient, insufficient, and sufficient were 34 (32%), 31 (29%), and 41 (39%), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate ranged from 32% in the vitamin D sufficient group to 39% in the insufficient group and the relationship between vitamin D level and mortality was not statistically significant (p=0.825). Further, after adjusting for comorbidities in the multivariable analyses, neither the insufficient (OR=1.54; 95% CI=[0.462, 5.29]) nor the sufficient (OR=0.66; 95% CI=[0.186, 2.26]) vitamin D level groups showed a decrease in 30-day mortality compared to the deficient group. Conclusion These data suggest that vitamin D level is not associated with an increased risk of 30-day COVID related mortality, but further studies with greater sample size may help to illustrate other risks associated with vitamin D deficiency.",2021,/,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,69,SUPPL 1,S99,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,634826810,#103931,Deland 2021,,,0,0.06911983
Safety profile of enhanced thromboprophylaxis strategies for critically ill COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic: observational report from 28 European intensive care units.,"Lavinio, Andrea; Ercole, Ari; Battaglini, Denise; Magnoni, Sandra; Badenes, Rafael; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Helbok, Raimund; Thomas, William; Pelosi, Paolo; Robba, Chiara; collaborators","INTRODUCTION: Critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is associated with a high burden of pulmonary embolism (PE) and thromboembolic events despite standard thromboprophylaxis. Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality., METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage., RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37-85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1-30.7) Kg/m2 and 13 (7-22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients. ET was used in 274 (32.1%) patients, and it was independently associated with significant reduction in ICU mortality (log odds = 0.64 [95% CIs 0.18-1.1; p = 0.0069]) but not an increased risk of critical haemorrhage (log odds = 0.187 [95%CI - 0.591 to - 0.964; p = 0.64])., CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis.

POS-029 PATTERNS OF AKI IN PATIENTS HOSPITALISED WITH COVID-19 DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN A LARGE UK TERTIARY CENTRE,"JEWELL, P.; Bramham, K.; Smith, P.; Kibble, H.; Mudhaffer, A.; Akter, M.; Zuckerman, B.; Palmer, K.; Murphy, C.; Iatropoulou, D.; Lioudaki, E.; Norton, S.; Sharpe, C. ","Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is common, and is associated with worse prognosis, especially among critically unwell patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors and impact of AKI on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in a large UK tertiary centre. Method(s): We retrospectively collected and analysed data from electronic health records of all adult patients admitted with a clinical and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 across both hospital sites of large UK tertiary centre from 1st March to 13th May 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Those with pre-existing end-stage kidney disease or possible hospital-acquired COVID-19 were excluded. Incidents of AKI were identified using KDIGO criteria and weekly incidence rates were calculated. We developed a logistic regression model to identify predictors of AKI, and a Cox regression model to investigate the impact of AKI on mortality. Result(s): 1248 inpatients were included, with a mean age of 69 years and male preponderance of 58.8%. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 was present prior to admission in 16.6%. AKI occurred in 39% (n=487) patients, including stage 1 51% (n= 248), stage 2 13% (n=64) and stage 3 36% (n=175). 109 patients (8.7% of total, 22% of all AKI) required renal-replacement therapy (RRT). Of those who developed AKI and were discharged alive, 219 (84.6%) had recovered renal function to baseline creatinine by time of discharge and none required on-going RRT. The incidence rate of AKI increased on a weekly basis initially, peaking at 2.19 per 100 person-days at weeks 5 to 6, before reducing at a similar pace to 1.41 per 100 person-days by the end the study period (week 9 to 10). [Formula presented] On multivariable logistic regression, male sex (OR 1.55, P<0.001), black ethnicity (OR 1.79, P<0.0005), baseline eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2 (OR 3.06, P<0.0001), hypertension (OR 1.73, P<0.0005) and in-patient diuretic usage (OR 1.69, P<0.005) were significantly associated with AKI. Of those with AKI, 42.1% (n=205) died during admission, compared to 16.8% (n=128) without AKI. AKI was a strong predictor of 30 day mortality (see Figure), even at stage 1 with HR 1.65 (P<0.001), which increased further by stage to HR 3.1 (P<0.0001) for AKI stage 2 and HR 3.89 (P<0.0001) for stage 3, adjusting for other variables by multivariable Cox regression. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): AKI is common among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality, even at early stages. Inpatient diuretic use was significantly associated with AKI, and the reducing incidence of AKI over time following a peak may reflect a change in clinical practice as the pandemic progressed. Of those that survived, most recovered their renal function and none required ongoing RRT at discharge.

Low rates of COVID-19 in a vulnerable population: Learning from early and decisive public health policies,"Donaldson, Mira; Edeer, Nazde; Bhangu, Gurjeet; Greiner, Jesse; Murray, Melanie ","Background: Disasters, including pandemics, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of Vancouver has high prevalence of mental illness, substance use, infectious disease and homelessness. While studies have described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in other centres worldwide, data is lacking on marginalized groups. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients seen at two urban hospitals who care for the vulnerable population in the DTES of Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was conducted on all COVID-19 patients >=19 years seen at either centre from January 1 to June 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics assessed demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory values and outcomes, and were compared between subjects managed as inpatients (died vs. discharged) and outpatients. Result(s): Of 71 COVID-19 subjects, mean age was 57y (SD 20); 36 (51%) were male. Time to presentation, symptoms and laboratory values were similar to other reports. 58 (82%) presented from the community, 3 (4%) from long-term care/rehabilitation centres, and 8 (11%) had no fixed address (NFA) or lived in the DTES. 45 (64%) had a known exposure, 20 (28%) were healthcare workers, 85% involved in direct patient care; 0/20 were admitted to hospital. Of the 8 NFA/DTES subjects, mean age was 46y (SD 13), 50% were male, 5 (63%) were admitted to hospital and all survived. Admitted subjects (n=34) were older (mean age 69 vs 46y, p< 0.001), 62% were male, and had more comorbidities (mean [SD] 3 [3] vs. 1 [2], p< 0.001). Eight (24%) died, 26 (76%) were discharged, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 21% secondary infection, 18% renal failure, and 15% cardiac dysfunction. Of patients admitted to intensive care, 5/10 died. Conclusion(s): Our results concur with other studies showing older age and comorbidities contribute to more severe COVID-19 disease. 64% of subjects had a known exposure, and only 11% had NFA/DTES residence. Given that there is no financial barrier to access healthcare in Canada and these hospitals serve our most vulnerable populations, our results may indicate that BC Public Health has done an effective job of tracking and limiting community spread of COVID-19.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S296,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.650,634731828,#98916,Donaldson 2020,,,0,0.809145347

It is not known whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of death than residents without COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher mortality rate in NH residents, considering frailty status assessed with the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI)., METHODS: In this retrospective study, made in 31 NHs in Venice, Italy, the presence of COVID-19 was ascertained with a nasopharyngeal swab. Frailty was evaluated using the MPI, modified according to the tools commonly used in our NHs. A Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using COVID-19 as exposure and mortality as outcome and stratified by MPI tertiles. Similar analyses were run using MPI tertiles as exposure., RESULTS: Overall, 3946 NH residents (median age = 87 years, females: 73.9%) were eligible, with 1136 COVID-19 + . During a median follow-up of 275 days, higher values of MPI, indicating frailer people, were associated with an increased risk of mortality. The incidence of mortality in COVID-19 + was more than doubled than COVID-19- either in MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3 groups. The presence of COVID-19 increased the risk of death (HR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59-2.15), also in the propensity score model using MPI as confounder (HR = 2.48; 95% CI 2.10-2.93)., CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of NH residents, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality than those not affected by COVID-19 also considering the different grades of frailty.",2021,/,Aging clinical and experimental research,,101132995,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01855-6,33893989,#103499,Veronese 2021,,,0,0.219736748
Review of care and management of pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic,"Goyal, Manu; Singh, Pratibha; Melana, Nitesh ","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Covid-19 pandemic began in the end of 2019 and spread all over the world in a short duration of time. Measures have been taken such as social distancing, compulsory lockdown and restriction of activities so as to prevent spread of virus. It has posed problem to both the antenatal women and maternity care workers. The care and management of pregnant women is an essential service to identify high-risk mothers and also to have good pregnancy outcome for both mother and baby. Any delay in this may lead to catastrophe, hence this issue needs to be addressed properly. This review briefs about the literature available on antenatal care during covid-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is not very adversely affected by the virus itself but extra caution should be taken to prevent and complications should they arise. The norms of social distancing by patients and wearing personal protective equipment by hospital staff, testing of pregnant women should be followed as per regional and national guidelines. This will help ensure safety of all people along with care to the expecting mother. The presence of covid-19 infection should not deter women from receiving antenatal care nor should the obstetric treatment be delayed during labor. Decision for timing and mode of delivery should be individualised based on obstetric indications and maternal-fetal status.Copyright Â© 2020",2020,/,Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,59,6,791-794,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2020.09.001,2007940306,#101971,Goyal 2020,,,0,0.974664751
Vaccine and vaccination as a part of human life: in view of Covid-19,"mohanan, PV; Megha, KB","Vaccination created a breakthrough towards the improvement to the global health. The development of vaccine and their practice made a substantial control in infectious diseases. The emergence of new vaccines has facilitated targeting populations to alleviate and eliminate contagious pathogens from their innate reservoir. However, along with the infections like malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), effective immunisation remains obscure and imparts a great challenge unto the realm of science. The vaccines developed after utilizing plant based system supported technology comprises the incorporation of the preferred genes to express the specific protein (antigen) for a particular disease condition into the genome of plant tissues using several techniques. Though plant-supported vaccines propose several benefits to the vaccine industry, still there remain challenges that limit the rate of effective production of vaccines of this third-generation. A novel Corona virus SARS-CoV-2 reason for causing Corona virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) crashed the human population and rapidly spread round the world within the half of 2020 created a worldwide epidemic. The need for establishing a protected and compelling COVID-19 immunization is a global requirement to end this pandemic. Even though there exist lot of limitations, continuous efforts has put forward so as to develop highly competent and effective vaccine for many human and animal linked diseases due to its unlimited prospective.

The Influence Of Hla Genotype On The Severity Of Covid-19 Infection.,"Langton, David J; Bourke, Stephen C; Lie, Benedicte A; Reiff, Gabrielle; Natu, Shonali; Darlay, Rebecca; Burn, John; Echevarria, Carlos","BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 varies markedly, not only between individual patients but also between different populations. We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation., METHODS: Using next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing variable clinical outcomes following COVID-19 infection. 49 of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allele frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n=13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n=16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology., FINDINGS: We found a significant difference in the allele frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% versus 16.7%, p=0.003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01-DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (p=0.007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater frequencies in the North Western European population., INTERPRETATION: This regional study provides evidence that HLA genotype influences clinical outcome in COVID-19 infection. Validation studies must take account of the complex genetic architecture of the immune system across different geographies and ethnicities. This article is protected by copyright.

Fall prevention among veterans in a skilled nursing facility,"Yukawa, M.; Donohue, K.; Han, K.; Gottlieb, J.; Nguyen, B.; Ojute, F.; Yip, D. ","Background: In skilled nursing facilities (SNF), 50-70% of residents fall per year. SNF residents with dementia are more prone to fall, with an annual incidence of 60%. The Community Living Center (CLC) at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC), reported annual fall rate of 50%, compared to the national VA fall rate of 42%. Our goal was to reduce the rate of fall by 20% compared to fiscal year 2019. Method(s): We conducted process mapping with CLC interdisciplinary team members to identify barriers to fall prevention. The barriers included staff, patient population-specific challenges, environmental obstacles, and documentation, communication, and care protocol. Studies have shown that multi-pronged approaches yield the best results. We implemented 3 interventions: fall education, purposeful huddles, and toilet seat risers. Physical therapists and occupational therapists stated that low toilet seats were fall risk for Veterans. Result(s): We partnered with the CLC's nurse educator to adapt the ""5 P's Proactive Patient Rounding"" education tool as a pocket card for the CLC nursing staff. By end of May 2020, all CLC nurses were educated in these 5 P's and fall prevention. Watch List Huddle was started in January 2020, to discussed care plans for residents who nurses were concerned about. Every resident who fell were discussed during these rounds which met three times a week. Lastly, toilet seat risers were placed in each bathroom in July 2020. Implementation of our interventions lead to 40% decrease in the average number of falls. Conclusion(s): Re-training in fall prevention, improving communication and care plan after fall and raising the toilet seats significantly reduce the rate of falls by 40%. This result was much larger than our goal 20% reduction. An increase in nursing staff hiring and a decreased census within the CLC due to COVID-19 quarantine may have contributed to better than expected outcome.",2021,/,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,69,SUPPL 1,S11,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,634826660,#103926,Yukawa 2021,,,0,0.90532724

Later, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causal agent of pneumonia. This virus has since spread to more than 180 countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Herein, we aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the relationship between the influenza vaccine with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection in the state of Sinaloa. We collected demographic and clinical data of 4,040 patients with acute respiratory infections across Sinaloa state hospitals from February 28 to May 15, 2020. The prevalence of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms in Sinaloa showed 45.2% of men were more affected than women (p < 0.001), and people aged 40-49 years were the most affected. The main symptoms of COVID-19 infection were cough and fever (p < 0.001), while hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes were the chronic diseases associated with COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.003). Healthcare workers were most likely to be infected compared to other occupations (p < 0.001). The general lethality rate was 14.1%, and males >62 years were the ones who had a higher lethality rate (p < 0.001); the aforementioned chronic diseases were related to higher lethality of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Likewise, higher lethality was seen in housewives and patient retirees/pensioners compared with other occupations (p < 0.001). Finally, we found there was a relationship between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality (p < 0.001). These findings showed that healthcare workers, men >62 years with chronic diseases, and retired people were most affected. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine could decrease the severeness of COVID-19 cases.

Genetics Insight for COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: A Review.,"Fricke-Galindo, Ingrid; Falfan-Valencia, Ramces","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic to a severe clinical course. The host genetic background influence on the susceptibility and outcome of multiples infectious diseases has been previously reported. Herein, we aimed to describe relevant identified genetic variants and those potentially related to the inter-individual variability of COVID-19 susceptibility and/or severity considering the physiopathological pathway of the disease The HLA-A*25:01, -B*15:27, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, and -C*07:29 alleles have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility; while HLA-A*02:02, -B*15:03, and -C*12:03 have been identified as low-risk alleles. Variants in cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL17A, FCGR2A, and TNF could be related to disease susceptibility and cytokine storm, and/or COVID-19 complications (e.g., venous thrombosis). Several variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 affecting the expression of the receptors related to COVID-19 have been associated with the disease susceptibility and risk factors. Finally, two GWAS have identified the loci 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, SLC6A20, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) and 9q34.2 (ABO) with COVID-19 severity. Heterogeneous results in the association of genetic variants with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were observed. The mechanism of identified risk-genes and studies in different populations are still warranted.

Clinical features and risk factors of COVID-19-associated liver injury and function: A retrospective analysis of 830 cases,"Chen, Faxiang; Chen, Jianpu; Xie, Wei; Wang, Xiang; Xie, Yuanliang; Chen, Wei; Xu, Dan ","Background: The incidence of liver injury (LI) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ranged from 14% to 53% based on sole or multiple elevated indexes for LI. The aims of our study were to investigate the changes of parameters (ALT, AST) in LI and determine the risk factors for LI in a cohort of 830 COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Demographic information, clinical features, and laboratory testing outcomes on admission were compared between patients with and without liver biochemistry abnormality (LBA). The same comparisons were performed between the LBA and LI groups. The updated RUCAM was used to determine the causality between drugs application and LI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore the potential risk factors associated with LBA and LI. Result(s): A total of 227 (27.3%) patients exhibited LBA and 32 (3.9%) patients were categorized as having LI based on the diagnostic criteria. 32.6% (74/227) of the LBA patients had RUCAM score >3, whereas the non-LBA patients had a slight lower at rate of 24.2% (146/603) (P = 0.047). Multivariable regression showed that a higher incidence of LBA was associated with hepatic hypoattenuation on computed tomography (CT) (odds ratio: 2.243, 95% confidence interval: 1.410-3.592, p = 0.001), lymphocyte proportion <20% (2.088, 1.476-2.954, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) >1 mg/dL (2.650, 1.845-3.806, p < 0.001) and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio >1 (2.558, 1.820-3.596, p < 0.001).

Performance comparison of the Cobas R Liat R and Cepheid R GeneXpert R systems on SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swab and posterior oropharyngeal saliva.,"Tsang, Hin Fung; Leung, Wai Ming Stanley; Chan, Lawrence Wing Chi; Cho, William Chi Shing; Wong, Sze Chuen Cesar","Background: Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) based methods such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) are the gold standard for diagnosis of current infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The cobas R Liat R and cepheid R GeneXpert R systems are two rapid real-time RT-PCR platforms offering rapid, specimen-to-answer detection of SARS-CoV-2. Research design and methods: In this study, we compared the performance of these two systems on SARS-CoV-2 detection in 9 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and 70 posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens collected from 79 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection between August 2020 and March 2021. Results: The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) and overall Percent Agreement (OPA) between cepheid R Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and cobas R Liat R SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay were found to be 100%. We demonstrated an excellent overall test concordance of the Liat R SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay and Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. The small sample size of SARS-CoV-2 positive and weak-positive specimens is the inherent limitation of this study.

The association of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness with COVID-19 incidence and mortality: A cohort study.,"Christensen, Rebecca A G; Arneja, Jasleen; St Cyr, Kate; Sturrock, Shelby L; Brooks, Jennifer D","BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be used to identify those at greatest risk for severe COVID-19 illness. However, no study to date has examined the association between CRF and COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF is independently associated with testing positive with or dying from COVID-19., METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 2,690 adults from the UK Biobank Study that were followed from March 16th, 2020 to July 26th, 2020. Participants who were tested for COVID-19 and had undergone CRF assessment were examined. CRF was estimated (eCRF) and categorized as low (<20th percentile), moderate (20th to 80th percentile) and high (>=80th percentile) within sex and ten-year age groups (e.g. 50-60 years). Participants were classified as having COVID-19 if they tested positive (primarily PCR tests) at an in-patient or out-patient setting as of July 26, 2020. Participants were classified as having died from COVID-19 if the primary or underlying cause of death was listed ICD-10 codes U071 or U072 by June 30th, 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and a forward model building approach used to identify covariates., FINDINGS: There was no significant association between eCRF and testing positive for COVID-19. Conversely, individuals with moderate (aRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.75) and high fitness (aRR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.85) had a significantly lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with low fitness., CONCLUSIONS: While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus.",2021,/,PloS one,16,5,e0250508,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250508,33951071,#105286,Christensen 2021,,,0,0.98427247

A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed. In the US, the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021. By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021., Objective: To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccine receipt., Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021)., Exposures: Receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine., Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians., Results: Patients' ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years; all were White women, reported from 11 states. Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1); none had documented prior heparin exposure. Time from Ad26.COV2.S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days. Eleven patients initially presented with headache; 1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache. Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage; 8 had non-CVST thromboses. After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment. Platelet nadir ranged from 9 x103/microL to 127 x103/microL. All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results. All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]). As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4)., Conclusions and Relevance: The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination represent serious events.

However, little systematic research has been carried out to assess the mental health needs of FLWs in Europe, or the extent of psychological suffering in FLWs within different European countries of varying outbreak severity. Accordingly, this project will employ a mixed-methods approach over three work packages to develop best-practice guidelines for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs during the different phases of the pandemic. Work package 1 will identify the point and long-term prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs, and the predictors of these symptoms. Work package 2 will perform a qualitative needs assessment on a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs to identify sources of stress and resilience, barriers to psychological care, and optimal strategies for alleviating psychological distress in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Work package 3 will synthesise the findings from the preceding work packages to draft best practice guidelines, which will be co-created by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the Delphi method. The guidelines will provide clinicians with a framework for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs, with particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also have relevance for future pandemics and other public health emergencies.

It is important to protect them in order to reduce nosocomial transmission and maintain the assistance capacity of health systems. To evaluate the diagnostic test and retest strategy with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 among healthcare workers., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out in a Brazilian hospital. From April 27 to June 16, 2020, symptomatic healthcare workers underwent an RT-PCR test on upper respiratory tract specimens as soon as possible and, if negative, it was repeated close to the 5th day of symptom evolution. Working areas were divided into assistance areas dedicated or not dedicated to COVID-19 and non-assistance areas. The type of activity was divided into assistance or non-assistance activity., RESULTS: 775 individuals were evaluated. 114 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 101 followed the testing protocol.

Does solar ultraviolet radiation play a role in COVID-19 infection and deaths? An environmental ecological study in Italy,"Diemoz, Henri; Fountoulakis, Ilias; Maluta, Francesco; Ceccon, Daniela; di Sarra, Alcide; Facta, Stefania; Fedele, Francesca; Lorenzetto, Giuseppe; Siani, Anna Maria; Isaia, Gianluca; Isaia, Giancarlo ","A significantly stronger impact in mortality and morbidity by COVID-19 has been observed in the northern Italian regions compared to the southern ones. The reasons of this geographical pattern might involve several concurrent factors. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether any correlations exist between the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different Italian regions and the amount of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Earth's surface. To this purpose, in this environmental ecological study a mixed-effect exponential regression was built to explain the incidence of COVID-19 based on the environmental conditions, and demographic and pathophysiologic factors. Observations and estimates of the cumulative solar UV exposure have been included to quantify the amount of radiation available e.g., for pre-vitamin D3 synthesis or SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by sunlight. The analysis shows a significant correlation (p-value <5 x 10-2) between the response variables (death percentage, incidence of infections and positive tests) and biologically effective solar UV radiation, residents in nursing homes per inhabitant (NHR), air temperature, death percentage due to the most frequent comorbidities. Among all factors, the amount of solar UV radiation is the variable contributing the most to the observed correlation, explaining up to 83.2% of the variance of the COVID-19 affected cases per population. While the statistical outcomes of the study do not directly entail a specific cause-effect relationship, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that solar UV radiation impacted on the development of the infection and on its complications, e.g. through the effect of vitamin D on the immune system or virus inactivation by sunlight. The analytical framework used in this study, based on commonly available data, can be easily replicated in other countries and geographical domains to identify possible correlations between exposure to solar UV radiation and the spread of the pandemic.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Science of the Total Environment,757,"(Isaia) Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Italy(Diemoz, Fountoulakis) Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA), Valle d'Aosta, Italy(Maluta) Department of Industrial Chemistry, University of Bologna, Italy(Ceccon) Provincial Envi",143757,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143757,2010208967,#102804,Diemoz 2021,,,0,0.388041942
"Acute and chronic exposure to air pollution in relation with incidence, prevalence, severity and mortality of COVID-19: a rapid systematic review.","Katoto, Patrick D M C; Brand, Amanda S; Bakan, Buket; Obadia, Paul Musa; Kuhangana, Carsi; Kayembe-Kitenge, Tony; Kitenge, Joseph Pyana; Nkulu, Celestin Banza Lubaba; Vanoirbeek, Jeroen; Nawrot, Tim S; Hoet, Peter; Nemery, Benoit","BACKGROUND: Air pollution is one of the world's leading mortality risk factors contributing to seven million deaths annually. COVID-19 pandemic has claimed about one million deaths in less than a year. However, it is unclear whether exposure to acute and chronic air pollution influences the COVID-19 epidemiologic curve., METHODS: We searched for relevant studies listed in six electronic databases between December 2019 and September 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Studies presented as original articles, studies that assessed risk, incidence, prevalence, or lethality of COVID-19 in relation with exposure to either short-term or long-term exposure to ambient air pollution were included. All patients regardless of age, sex and location diagnosed as having COVID-19 of any severity were taken into consideration. We synthesised results using harvest plots based on effect direction., RESULTS: Included studies were cross-sectional (n = 10), retrospective cohorts (n = 9), ecological (n = 6 of which two were time-series) and hypothesis (n = 1). Of these studies, 52 and 48% assessed the effect of short-term and long-term pollutant exposure, respectively and one evaluated both. Pollutants mostly studied were PM2.5 (64%), NO2 (50%), PM10 (43%) and O3 (29%) for acute effects and PM2.5 (85%), NO2 (39%) and O3 (23%) then PM10 (15%) for chronic effects. Most assessed COVID-19 outcomes were incidence and mortality rate. Acutely, pollutants independently associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality were first PM2.5 then PM10, NO2 and O3 (only for incident cases). Chronically, similar relationships were found for PM2.5 and NO2. High overall risk of bias judgments (86 and 39% in short-term and long-term exposure studies, respectively) was predominantly due to a failure to adjust aggregated data for important confounders, and to a lesser extent because of a lack of comparative analysis., CONCLUSION: The body of evidence indicates that both acute and chronic exposure to air pollution can affect COVID-19 epidemiology. The evidence is unclear for acute exposure due to a higher level of bias in existing studies as compared to moderate evidence with chronic exposure. Public health interventions that help minimize anthropogenic pollutant source and socio-economic injustice/disparities may reduce the planetary threat posed by both COVID-19 and air pollution pandemics.",2021,/,Environmental health : a global access science source,20,1,41,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-021-00714-1,33838685,#97919,Katoto 2021,,,0,0.763377924
COVID-19 related headache and its clinical characteristics,"Barut, Banu Ozen; Ulutas, Samiye; Sahbaz, Gulhan; Celik, Afra; Kara, Tugce sule; Ongoru, Pinar ","Objectives: Headache is one of the most common neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. This study examined the prevalence of headache and its clinical properties in patients with COVID-19. Method(s):This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients from a neurology inpatient ward. Data for COVID-19-positive patients aged between 17 and 88 years were analyzed, based on the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) for SARS COV-2. Headache prevalence and characteristics and routine laboratory examinations were investigated. Result(s): The study analyzed 209 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Of these, 142 (67.9%) patients suffered headaches during COVID-19 infection and 107/209 (51.2%)patients reported a new type of headache. Of the209 patients, 101 (48.3%) also described decreases in smell and taste during the headache. The most common headache location was fronto-orbital, in 52/142 (40.6%) patients. Most patients had a bilateral headache (90.8%). Conclusion(s): As our knowledge of COVID-19 accumulates, we find that COVID-19 headache is not a random symptom. A new or different kind of throbbing headache that is bilateral and fronto-orbital might be related to COVID-19 disease.Copyright Â© 2021, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: Long-term outcomes,"Mahmood, Syed Nazeer; Chaturvedi, Mansi; Oweis, Emil; Chan, Chee ","INTRODUCTION: Patients with hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often require mechanical ventilatory (MV) support for an average of 10-16 days. A subset of patients were challenging to wean off the ventilator but survived long enough to undergo tracheostomy for persistent respiratory failure. There is a paucity of data regarding long term outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection who underwent tracheostomy. This study evaluates the outcomes for these patients. METHOD(S): We performed a single center, retrospective cohort study of intubated COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital between March 1, 2020 and May 25, 2020. Patients requiring MV for >13 days were included in the study. Our primary outcome was prevalance of persistent respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and long term outcomes. Our secondary outcomes were variables that increased the risk of tracheostomy. Data collected included baseline demographics, underlying diseases, tobacco and marijuana use, length of hospital stay and mortality. Descriptive statistics were used for prevalence. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze categorical variables; Student t-test and Mann-Whitney U were used for linear variables where appropriate. All tests were two tailed; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): A total of 86 patients were included (age: 61.6 +/- 14.7; males: 50%). Overall, 15 (17.4%) underwent tracheostomy. Comorbidities were similar between groups to include underlying lung disease and obesity. The rate of tobacco and cannabis use was also similar. The most common reason for tracheostomy was failure to pass spontaneous breathing trials (60%) followed by persistent altered mental status and inability to protect the airway (13%). For long term outcomes, 2 (13.3%) were died, 6 (40%) could not be weaned off the ventilator, 6 (40%) were successfully weaned to tracheostomy mask and 1 (6.7%) was successfully decannulated. CONCLUSION(S): Tracheostomy may be offered to patients with COVID-19 infection who require MV for >13 days. A significant proportion of patients undergoing tracheostomy were weaned off the ventilator. The decision of undergoing tracheostomy should be individualized based on risks and benefits of the procedure as well as expected patient outcome.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,136,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000727080.29065.35,634766999,#102103,Mahmood 2021,,,0,0.632551088
Cardiovascular injuries during COVID-19 infection: A PROCESS-compliant case series from the Eastern Morocco.,"El Rhalete, Abdelilah; Rhazi, Inas; Bensaid, Amine; Zaid, Ikram; Bkiyer, Houssam; Ismaili, Nabila; Elouafi, Nouha; Housni, Brahim","Background: To date, more than 105,805,951 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed including 2,312,278 deaths. Many patients have cardiovascular risk-factors and/or co-morbidities and a lot of them developed de novo heart conditions during the active or the post-infectious phase of the infection. A number of studies tried to demonstrate an association between poor prognostic outcomes and cardiovascular comorbidities and related damages, but the quality of current evidence is still weak., Patients and methods: The aim of this single-center report is to describe the prevalence of cardiac injuries among our COVID-19 patients, to explore their association with survival outcomes and to demonstrate the medical care provided in our real-world setting. Our study included 610 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our university hospital of whom13.77% (n = 84) presented cardiovascular injuries and which we included in this case series., Results: The average age of our patients was 65 years (27-90). 60 were men (71.42%) while 24 were women (28.55%). Their average BMI was 29.7 kg/m2. Among them, 50 had a pulmonary embolism (59.52%), 12 patients had a myocardial infarction (14.28%), 10 presented pericarditis (11.9%) and 3 developed myocarditis (3.57%). There were 6 cases of ischemia (7.14%), 2 cases of stroke (2.38%), and 1 case of decompensated heart failure (1.19%). Among our patients, 46.42% had diabetes, 32.14% had a high blood pressure, 13.09% had a chronic renal failure and 14.28% had a history of ischemic heart disease. 14 patients (16.66%) had an elevated troponin with higher levels than 1000 ng/mL. The D-dimer value was high in almost all patients (80.95%). Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 27.38%, severe in 32.14%, and critical in 40.47% of enrolled cases. CT chest angiography, ECG, and cardiac ultrasound were performed to the paraclinical confirmatory exploration of cardiac damages of these patients. Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab was indicated for 17 patients with hyperferritinemia (20.23% of patients). The initial respiratory care of our patients required oxygen therapy using nasal cannula (7.14%) high concentration masks (33.33%), high flow nasal cannula treatment (11.9%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (5.95%), and mechanical ventilation (41.66%). Thrombolysis was performed in three subjects with myocardial infarction and 2 underwent angioplasty with placement of an active stent at the proximal interventricular anterior artery, which all were successful. Three massive pulmonary embolisms died despite adequate treatment. Colchicine and salicylic acid were administered for pericarditis cases. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated for all patients and was reinforced if a venous thrombotic episode was confirmed. Patients with limb ischemia underwent surgical treatment. Among the 84 patients included in our cohort, 34 (40.47%) died in intensive care unit and 50 (59.52%) had a favorable evolution., Conclusion: Cardiovascular involvement during COVID-19 should not be neglected and are associated with severe outcomes.

Chemo-Preventive Effect of Vegetables and Fruits Consumption on the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Yedjou, Clement G; Alo, Richard A; Liu, Jinwei; Enow, Juliet; Ngnepiepa, Pierre; Long, Richard; Latinwo, Lekan; Tchounwou, Paul B","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a global pandemic that has claimed the death of 1,536,957 human beings worldwide including 287,842 deaths in the United States as of December 3, 2020. It has become a major threat to the medical community and the entire healthcare system in every part of the world. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the emergency use of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 12, 2020. However, there are concern about the new COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. In addition, both coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are new at this point and there is no scientific evidence to know whether people who are vaccinated can still carry the COVID 19 pathogens and pass them along to others. Therefore, many people all over the world have an increased interest in consuming more VF for the purpose of maintaining their health and boosting their immune system. Identifying novel antiviral agents for COVID-19 is of critical importance, and VF is an excellent source for drug discovery and therapeutic development. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a high intake of vegetables and/or fruits prevents COVID-19 incidence and reduces the mortality rate. To achieve this objective, we collected the diet data of COVID-19 from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset), and used a machine-learning algorithm to examine the effects of different food types on COVID-19 incidences and deaths. Specifically, we used the feature selection method to identify the factors (e.g., diet-related factors) that contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Data generated from the study demonstrated that VF intake can help to combat the SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, VF may be potential chemopreventive agents for COVID-19 due to their antiviral properties and their ability to boost the human body immune system.",2021,/,Journal of nutrition & food sciences,4,2,,,,33884222,#101305,Yedjou 2021,,,0,0.683213066
A Statewide Multi-institutional Study of Asymptomatic Pre-Treatment Testing of Radiation Therapy Patients for SARS-CoV-2 in a High-Incidence Region of the United States.,"Modi, C; Dragun, A E; Henson, C F; Jain, S; Ahlawat, S; Eastwick, G; Kubicek, G J; Mezera, M; Mulvihill, D J; Perri, J; Juneja, B; Khullar, K; Ennis, R D; Haffty, B G","Purpose/Objectives: To establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients scheduled to receive radiation therapy and its impact on management decisions., Materials/Methods: Between April 2020 and July 2020, patients without influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms at four radiation oncology departments (2 academic university hospitals and 2 community hospitals) underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients were tested either prior to radiotherapy simulation or after simulation but prior to treatment initiation. Patients tested for indications of ILI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Management of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was individualized based on disease site and acuity., Results: Over a three-month period, a total of 385 tests were performed in 336 asymptomatic patients either prior to simulation (n=75), post-simulation, prior to treatment (n=230), or on-treatment (n=49). A total of 5 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a pre-treatment prevalence of 1.3% (2.6% in North/Central NJ and 0.4% in Southern NJ/Southeast PA). The median age of positive patients was 58 years (range: 38-78 years). All positive patients were white and were relatively equally distributed with regard to gender (2 male, 3 female) and ethnicity (2 Hispanic and 3 non-Hispanic). The median Charlson comorbidity score among positive patients was 5. All 5 patients were treated for different primary tumor sites, the large majority had advanced disease (80%), and all were treated for curative intent. The majority of positive patients were being treated with either sequential or concurrent immunosuppressive systemic therapy (80%). Initiation of treatment was delayed for 14 days with the addition of re-testing for 4 patients, while one patient was treated without delay but with additional infectious-disease precautions., Conclusion: Broad-based pre-treatment asymptomatic testing of radiation oncology patients for SARS-CoV-2 is of limited value, even in a high-incidence region. Future strategies may include focused risk-stratified asymptomatic testing.

"Students' views towards sars-cov-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation in a university setting during the covid-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","Blake, Holly; Knight, Holly; Jia, Ru; Morling, Joanne R.; Ayling, Kieran; Vedhara, Kavita; Corner, Jessica; Denning, Chris; Ball, Jonathan K.; Tighe, Patrick; Bolton, Kirsty; Figueredo, Grazziela; Morris, David E.; Villalon, Armando Mendez ","We aimed to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised of four rapid online focus groups conducted at a higher education institution in England, during high alert (tier 2) national COVID-19 restrictions. Participants were purposively sampled university students (n = 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

The complexity and dynamics of the immune response present a challenge to understanding variation in SARS-CoV-2 infections. To address this challenge, we apply control theory, a framework used to study complex feedback systems, to establish rigorous mathematical bounds on immune responses. Two mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 biology are sufficient to create extreme variation between hosts: (1) a sparsely expressed host receptor and (2) potent, but not unique, suppression of interferon. The resulting model unifies disparate and unexplained features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, predicts features of future viruses that threaten to cause pandemics, and identifies potential interventions.",2021,,,,,,PPR316498,10.1101/2021.04.25.441372,,#104528,Sarma 2021,,,0,0.304562813

AutoVEM: an automated tool to real-time monitor epidemic trends and key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 evolution.,"Xi, Binbin; Jiang, Dawei; Li, Shuhua; Lon, Jerome R; Bai, Yunmeng; Lin, Shudai; Hu, Meiling; Meng, Yuhuan; Qu, Yimo; Huang, Yuting; Liu, Wei; Huang, Lizhen; Du, Hongli","With the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to effectively monitor the variation, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations of SARS-CoV-2 over time. This is of great significance to the development of new vaccines, the update of therapeutic drugs, and the improvement of detection methods. The AutoVEM tool developed in the present study could complete all mutations detections, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and candidate key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2GB RAM computer. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends analysis of 131,576 genome sequences, the great significance of the previous 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) was further revealed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were discovered for the first time that might be related to the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, we proposed an integrative method and developed an efficient automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen for the candidate key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time for the first time, and all data could be updated quickly to track the prevalence of previous key mutations and new candidate key mutations because of high efficiency of the tool. In addition, the idea of combinatorial analysis in the present study can also provide a reference for the mutation monitoring of other viruses. Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

To combat the devastating spread of SARS-CoV-2, extraordinary efforts from numerous laboratories have focused on the development of effective and safe vaccines. Traditional live-attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines are not recommended for immunocompromised patients as the attenuated virus can still cause disease via phenotypic or genotypic reversion. Subunit vaccines require repeated dosing and adjuvant use to be effective, and DNA vaccines exhibit lower immune responses. mRNA vaccines can be highly unstable under physiological conditions. On the other hand, naturally antigenic viral vectors with well-characterized structure and safety profile serve as among the most effective gene carriers to provoke immune response via heterologous gene transfer. Viral vector-based vaccines induce both an effective cellular immune response and a humoral immune response owing to their natural adjuvant properties via transduction of immune cells. Consequently, viral vectored vaccines carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have recently been generated and successfully used to activate cytotoxic T cells and develop a neutralizing antibody response. Recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with an emphasis on gene therapy viral vector-based vaccine development, is discussed in this review.",2021,/,Human gene therapy,,"a12, 9008950",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/hum.2021.052,33858231,#98229,Bisgin 2021,,,0,0.564551258
COVID-19 and emerging spinal cord complications: A systematic review,"Mondal, Ritwick; Ganguly, Upasana; Deb, Shramana; Shome, Gourav; Lahiri, Durjoy; Benito-Leon, Julian ","Background:: Spinal cord complications associated with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) are being widely reported. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize so far available pieces of evidence documenting de novo novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mediated spinal cord demyelinating diseases. Indeed, the spinal demyelinating disorders that have been reported in those patients who have suffered from COVID-19 rather than on the people already living with diagnosed or undiagnosed primary demyelinating disorders. Method(s):: We used the existing PRISMA consensus statement. Data were collected from PubMed, NIH Litcovid, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases, as well as Pre-print servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, and pre-preints.org), until September 10, 2020, using pre-specified searching strategies. Result(s):: The 21 selected articles were all case reports and included 11 (52%) men and 10 (48%) women. The mean age was of 46.7 +/- 18.0. The neurological manifestations included weakness, sensory deficit, autonomic dysfunction and ataxia. In most cases, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis were found. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five (24%) patients, meanwhile in 13 (62%) patients, the testing was negative. Testing was not performed in two cases and, in one, data were unavailable. Nearly half of the cases (N = 9) were associated with isolated long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), whereas a combination of both LETM and patchy involvement was found in two. Only five patients had isolated short segment involvement and two patchy involvement. Furthermore, concomitant demyelination of both brain and spine was reported in six patients. Concerning the prognosis, most of the patients improved and the mortality rate was low (N = 2, <10%). Conclusion(s):: Spinal cord demyelination should be added to the plethora of immune mediated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders,51,"(Mondal, Ganguly, Lahiri) Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India(Deb) S.N.

"Outbreak of COVID-19 among school auction attendees: Was it a ""silent auction"" or ""silent transmission""?","Rankin, Danielle A.; Fernandez, Kailee N.; Haddadin, Zaid; Howard, Leigh; Talj, Rana; Spieker, Andrew J.; Halasa, Natasha B. ","Background: One day after the pandemic was announced, Tennessee declared a state of emergency on March 12, 2020 with implementation of a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020. Data regarding the routes and patterns of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are limited. We initiated an investigation after clusters of confirmed COVID-19 cases attended a large social gathering. Method(s): We were notified of clinical providers who attended a ""Silent School Auction"" on March 7, 2020, of which several confirmed-cases were identified as targeted participants. To derive a standardized REDCap web-survey, we conducted a hypothesis-generating interview with three confirmed attendees to collect event details. Once finalized, enrollment included collecting sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data. Attendees were classified as: 1) confirmed if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; 2) suspected if they developed symptoms 21-days before or after the auction; and 3) asymptomatic if no symptoms were noted. Result(s): From March 20-June 16, 100/166 (60%) of attendees were enrolled, with a median age of 41 years, 54% female, and 99% white. Of those, 34 and 32 were confirmed- and suspect-cases, respectively. Table 1 compares sociodemographic behaviors of all attendees, with the majority of confirmed-cases eating late in the evening. From March 6 to March 8, 58 participants reported attending other social events, of which three (i.e., church service, women's retreat, and a birthday party) were common among 43 attendees and five individuals reported onset of mild respiratory symptoms prior to the event (Figure 1). Confirmed-cases were more likely to report having shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of taste, loss of smell, and fever compared to suspect-cases (Figure 2) and no one required hospitalization. Dining tables from the school auction depicted a clustering of cases occurring at each table, with some individuals visiting more than one table during the event (Figure 3). Conclusion(s): We identified several COVID-19 cases from a single event that occurred prior to social mitigation strategies. Our investigation highlights the importance of staying home when sick and the significance of social distancing to halt transmission of COVID-19.

Future vaccinations in pregnancy.,"Vress, D","Vaccination in pregnancy provides an important opportunity to target illnesses that are known to impact pregnant women, fetal development, and newborns in particular. The ability to create antibodies through safe vaccination that cross the placenta can provide protection against maternal, congenital, and newborn infections. At present, multiple vaccines are being developed which have direct benefits for pregnant women and their newborns. Group B streptococcus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Zika, Ebola, Malaria, and Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are all being researched with the view to develop a safe vaccine available for pregnant women. There is also an increased movement towards the inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine development and trials - challenging the historical, ethical, and medicolegal arguments against their involvement in such research.

"Respiratory coinfections with COVID-19 in veterans health administration (VA), 2020","Schirmer, Patricia; Lucero-Obusan, Cynthia; Sharma, Aditya; Sohoni, Pooja; Oda, Gina; Holodniy, Mark ","Background: The first US cases occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic in Jan. 2020. Initially, some states required patients be screened for other respiratory pathogens before COVID-19. Information on COVID-19 coinfections with other respiratory pathogens is limited. We investigated prevalence of COVID-19 coinfections with other respiratory pathogens in VA. Method(s): Molecular and viral culture test results from 9/29/2019-5/31/2020 for respiratory pathogens (Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis/parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, COVID-19 and other Coronaviruses, Influenza, human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rhino-Enterovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)) were identified from VA data sources. COVID-19 tested patients were evaluated within 7 days for respiratory pathogen coinfections from 2/1/2020-5/31/2020. Patient demographics were obtained for patients with coinfections. Result(s): A total of 825,282 respiratory pathogen tests (including COVID-19) were performed from Sept. 2019 with percent positive shown in Figure 1. Of these, 617,541 tests were performed starting in Feb. 2020 (Table 1). There were 14,839 (6.5%) positive COVID-19 tests (10,223 unique patients) of 227,111 tests performed (174,747 unique patients). 30,066/174,747 (17%) of patients with COVID-19 were tested for another respiratory pathogen. Fifty-six (0.55%) unique COVID-19 patients were detected with coinfection including 3 COVID-19 positive patients with > 1 other respiratory pathogen (2 with Coronavirus and Adenovirus and 1 with Coronavirus and Rhino-Enterovirus). Other coinfections included 18 Rhino-Enterovirus, 15 Influenza, 10 with another Coronavirus, 4 RSV, 3 hMPV, 2 HPIV, and 1 C. pneumoniae. Demographics of coinfected patients are shown in Table 2. Conclusion(s): In VA, coinfection with COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens was rare. Detection was limited since not all COVID-19 patients were tested for other respiratory pathogens and respiratory pathogens were declining when COVID- 19 emerged. Coinfections were detected with different respiratory pathogens. Further comparisons of coinfected vs. non-coinfected patients to assess outcome or actionable results will be important as we enter the next influenza season.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S267-S268,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa417.592,634732968,#99020,Schirmer 2020,,,0,0.706315577
Estimating the effectiveness of routine asymptomatic PCR testing at different frequencies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections.,"Hellewell, Joel; Russell, Timothy W; SAFER Investigators and Field Study Team; Crick COVID-19 Consortium; CMMID COVID-19 working group; Beale, Rupert; Kelly, Gavin; Houlihan, Catherine; Nastouli, Eleni; Kucharski, Adam J","BACKGROUND: Routine asymptomatic testing using RT-PCR of people who interact with vulnerable populations, such as medical staff in hospitals or care workers in care homes, has been employed to help prevent outbreaks among vulnerable populations. Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time., METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection., RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54-88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38-65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1-3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33-76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75-99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.",2021,/,BMC medicine,19,1,106,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-01982-x,33902581,#103647,Hellewell 2021,,,0,0.497604451
Timing is everything: the relationship between COVID outcomes and the date at which mask mandates are relaxed.,"Shoukat, Affan; Galvani, Alison P; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C","Importance: Several states including Texas and Mississippi have lifted their mask mandates, sparking concerns that this policy change could lead to a surge in cases and hospitalizations., Objective: To estimate the increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in Texas and Mississippi following the removal of mask mandates, and to evaluate the relative reduction of these outcomes if policy change is delayed by 90 days., Design Setting and Participants: This study uses an age-stratified compartmental model parameterized to incidence data in Texas and Mississippi to simulate increased transmission following policy change in March or June 2021, and to estimate the resulting number of incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths., Main Outcomes and Measures: The increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths if mask mandates are lifted on March 14 compared to lifting on June 12., Results: If transmission is increased by 67% when mask mandates are lifted, we projected 11.39 (CrI: 11.22 - 11.55) million infections, 170,909 (CrI: 167,454 - 174,379) hospitalizations, and 5647 (5511 - 5804) deaths (Figure 1) in Texas from March 14 through the end of 2021. Delaying NPI lift until June reduces the average number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 36%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. Proportionate differences were similar for the state of Mississippi. Peak hospitalization rates would be reduced by 79% and 63% in Texas and Mississippi, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: Removal of mask mandates in March 2021 is premature. Delaying this policy change until June 2021, when a larger fraction of the population has been vaccinated, will avert more than half of the expected COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and avoid an otherwise likely strain on healthcare capacity.",2021,/,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,,101767986,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.21254646,33851171,#97853,Shoukat 2021,,,0,0.888751074
Quasi-Simpson paradox in estimating the expected mortality rate from the SARS-CoV-2.,"Shaki, Yair Y","On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic, based on a high infection rate and a high case fatality rate (CFR). The combination of these two points led WHO to forecast a high expected mortality rate of approximately 2% of the population. The phenomenon of Simpson's paradox teaches us that we should be careful when we combine two variables together. Indeed, despite the high mortality rate in several places, this forecast seems to have collapsed. We believe one of the reasons for the erroneous forecasts is that combining the above points ignored a confounding variable - many of the virus carriers are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed.",2021,/,Science progress,104,2,3.69E+14,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00368504211009673,33884941,#101358,Shaki 2021,,,0,0.120593528

","Background and importance Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown aetiology that affects children younger than 5 years old. The SARS-CoV-2 COVID pandemic highlighted cases reported to have an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and KD. Clinical analogies verified between the two conditions open new perspectives with regard to aetiopathogenesis. Aim and objectives To describe a severe hyperinflammation case of a 9-year-old girl (27 kg,131 cm), previously healthy (mother tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; symptoms of high fever, diarrhoea, headache, abdominal pain), with clinical data regarding the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and KD. Material and methods In collaboration with the clinician, we reviewed a medical chart of a KD SARS-CoV-2 associated case, diagnosed between January and July 2020. Results On 16 April 2020, a 9-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency department for suspicion of acute abdomen with an associated persistent fever. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Abdominal ECO showed lymphadenomegaly due to hyperinflammation and CT scan reported evidence of interstitial, parenchymal thickening and pulmonary infiltration. Echocardiogram showed normal coronary arteries with minimal pericardial effusion. Broad spectrum empirical antibiotics were started. On 18 April (illness day 7) respiratory distress appeared, a critical condition similar to a shock syndrome and multiorgan failure occurred. Respiratory support and ionotropic agents were started in the intensive care unit. The diagnostic suspicion of atypical incomplete KD, non-coronary involvement, was confirmed and treatment was switched to intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g/kg/ day, acetylsalicylic acid 30 mg/kg/day and methylprednisolone infusion until the day of discharge. On illness day 10, laboratory blood tests showed progressive reduction in inflammation markers and rapid normalisation of liver enzymes (lipase 1824, amylase 502, declining leucocytes 8.57, Hb 12, negative CRP). Because of the uncertainty about the cause, anti-S-specific IgG antibodies to SARSCoV- 2 were measured. Serology testing for SARS-Cov-2 revealed IgG antibody concentrations. On day 12 of the illness, she was discharged. Conclusion and relevance It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate uncontrolled inflammation. Cases are being informally reported among paediatricians, and recently patients with severe forms have been reported, emphasising the apparent rise in the number of children presenting with a multisystem inflammatory state requiring intensive care.

POS-033 Acute Kidney Injury in Children with COVID-19,"Kari, J.; Shalaby, M.; Albanna, A.; Alahmadi, T.; Alherbish, A.; Alhasan, K. ","Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The reported incidence of AKI, however, varies among studies. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of AKI and its association with mortality and morbidity in children infected with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who required hospital admission. Method(s): This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study from three tertiary centers, which included children with confirmed COVID-19. All children were evaluated for AKI using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition and staging. Result(s): Of 89 children included, 19 (21%) developed AKI (52.6% stage I). A high renal angina index score was correlated with severity of AKI. Also, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was increased in children with AKI compared to those with normal kidney function (15% vs 1.5%). Patients with AKI had significantly more pediatric intensive care admissions (PICU) (32% vs. 2.8%, p< 0.001) and mortality (42% vs. 0%, p< 0.001). However, AKI was not associated with prolonged hospitalization (58% vs. 40%, p=0.163) or development of MIS-C (10.5% vs. 1.4%, p=0.051). Residual renal impairment at discharge occurred in 9% of patients. This was significantly influenced by the presence of comorbidities, hypotension, hypoxia, heart failure, acute respiratory distress, hypernatremia, abnormal liver profile, high C-reactive protein, and positive blood culture. Conclusion(s): AKI occurred in one-fifth of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission, with one-third of those requiring PICU. AKI was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and residual renal impairment at time of discharge.

"Exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 severity: a review of current insights, management and challenges.","Ali, Nurshad; Fariha, Khandaker Atkia; Islam, Farjana; Mishu, Moshiul Alam; Mohanto, Nayan Chandra; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir; Hossain, Khaled","Several epidemiological studies have suggested a link between air pollution and respiratory tract infections. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health worldwide. However, some parts of the globe have been worse affected in terms of prevalence and deaths than others. The causes and conditions of such variations have yet to be explored. Although some studies indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 severity, there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer. This review summarized the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and severity, as well discussed the possible management strategies and challenges involved. The available literature that investigated the correlation between air pollution and COVID infections and mortality were included in the review. The studies reviewed here suggest that exposure to air pollution, particularly to PM2.5 and NO2 is positively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. Some data indicate that air pollution can play an important role in the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A high percentage of COVID-19 incidences have been reported in the most polluted areas, where patients needed hospital admission. The available data also shows that both short-term and long-term air pollution may enhance COVID-19 severity. However, most of the studies that showed a link between air pollution and CVID-19 infections and mortality did not consider potential confounders during the correlation analysis. Therefore, more specific studies need to be performed focusing on some additional confounders such as individual age, population density, pre-existing comorbidities to determine the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and deaths.

Learning the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in the United States With Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Observational Study.,"Jha, Indra Prakash; Awasthi, Raghav; Kumar, Ajit; Kumar, Vibhor; Sethi, Tavpritesh","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health, economic, and social fabric of many nations worldwide. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being., OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence., RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19-generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy., CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.

This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far. Among survivors, the presence of the so-called post-COVID19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding. In patients who survived the SARS-CoV-2 infection, overt PPCS presents one or more symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating. The pathophysiology of PPCS is currently poorly understood, and whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process is unexplored. <h4>Methods & Results</h4> In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID19 survivors (post-COVID19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID19-free) were analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination. Besides, telomere length (TL) and ACE2 and DPP4 receptor expression were determined. The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-covid population (58,44 Â± 14,66 ChronoAge Vs. 67,18 Â± 10,86 BioAge, P<0,0001), determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10,45 Â± 7,29 years (+5.25 years above range of normality) compared to 3,68 Â± 8,17 years for the COVID19-free population (P<0,0001). A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID19 cohort compared to COVID19-free subjects (post-COVID19 TL: 3,03 Â± 2,39 Kb vs. COVID19-free: 10,67 Â± 11,69 Kb; P<0,0001). Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID19 patients compare to COVID19-free, while DPP-4 did not change. <h4>Conclusion</h4> In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID19 condition, particularly in the younger (<60 years). Although the consequences of such modifications on the long-term clinical outcome remain unclear, they might indicate a direction to investigate the pathophysiological basis of the post-COVID19 syndrome.",2021,,,,,,PPR316013,10.1101/2021.04.23.21255973,,#104502,Mongelli 2021,,,0,0.817851839

Recent studies have demonstrated poor outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We sought to assess the in-hospital outcomes of COVID19 patients with DM at our centre. METHOD(S): Ours was a single centre, retrospective, observational study of 470 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital. We divided these patients into 2 groups; those with DM and those without. We compared demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and in-hospital outcomes between the two groups. Statistics were performed using STATA. Statistical significance was assigned at p<0.05. RESULT(S): Out of the 470 patients included in the study, 35.53% of patients had DM. Mean age of patients with and without DM was 68.35years+/-1.08 vs 61.71+/-1.05years respectively. 8.72% of patients were on pharmacological therapy. The diabetic cohort had a higher prevalence of hypertension, heart failure compared to the non-diabetic cohort (88.02 vs49.5% p-value:0.004, 22.9% vs 9.31% p-value: 0.04). Other comorbidities such as OSA, CKD, COPD, Asthma were comparable between both groups. The DM group had a higher level of inflammatory markers during the course of hospitalisation (D-dimer 3802.68+/- 1499 vs 3448.13 +/-1139, CRP: 12.60+/-0.76 vs 11.85+/-0.60, ESR: 73.66+/-10.41 vs 58.04+/-7.10). The DM group had a significantly higher need for mechanical ventilation (18.56% vs 13.29%, p<0.03), and subsequent in-hospital mortality (43.35% vs 25.74% p<0.05). On multivariate regression, diabetics had 2.64 higher odds of in-hospital mortality, however, the p-value was not significant (Write ODDS Ratio and Confidence interval p-value: 0.116). CONCLUSION(S): Overall inpatient mortality was higher in patients with DM, likely driven by an increased need for mechanical ventilation. Our study positively adds to the existing literature that DM is a significant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,47,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726384.17149.f4,634767184,#101672,Kulkarni 2021,,,0,0.755486323
The mis-cery of COVID-19: The diagnostic conundrum of mis-c in sickle cell anemia,"Seamon, Keri; Zelinka, Kailea; Mathew, Smitha; Cagle, William ","INTRODUCTION: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a systemic inflammatory process similar to Kawasaki Disease in pediatric patients after SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The objective of this report is to demonstrate the diagnostic and treatment challenge of MIS-C in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with underlying hypercoagulable and pro-inflammatory states. METHOD(S): A 6-year-old female with a history of SCD presented to the Emergency Room with emesis, fever, and cough for two days. She demonstrated fever, abdominal pain, tachycardia, and tachypnea requiring oxygen. Chest X-ray indicated unilateral infiltrate, laboratory studies were significant for leukocytosis (WBC 35.5 thous/mm3), anemia (Hgb 4.7 g/dL), HgBS 78.6%, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive. She was diagnosed with acute chest syndrome with admission to the hospital floor. Day 2, she had a decrease in HgBS 25.8% after simple transfusion with improving symptoms. Day 4, she developed worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral lung infiltrates requiring noninvasive ventilation, and transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The diagnosis of MIS-C was made secondary to significantly elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 4.552 mg/dL, Ferritin 3155 ng/mL, D-Dimer 3452 ng/mL, BNP 153 pg/mL), and echocardiogram showing an ectatic right coronary artery. Treatment was initiated with remdesivir, dexamethasone, enoxaparin, intravenous immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma, and aspirin. There was significant clinical and laboratory improvement with transfer out of the PICU on day 6 and discharge home on day 8. Clinic followup two weeks later demonstrated resolution of coronary artery dilation and normalization of acute-phase reactants (CRP <0.1 mg/dL, Ferritin 1301 ng/mL, D-Dimer 201 ng/mL). RESULT(S): In patients with predisposed hypercoagulable and pro-inflammatory states, it is difficult to ascertain whether the elevation in acute phase reactants is a chronic or an acute on chronic process. The use of multiple consulting services and of ancillary studies such as echocardiogram helped clarify the diagnosis of MIS-C. With this disease still evolving, our case illustrates the complexity of MIS-C diagnosis in SCD and the potential importance of early and aggressive treatment.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,86,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726692.24514.09,634767010,#102104,Seamon 2021,,,0,0.731181401
"Changes in Alcohol Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic-Small Change in Total Consumption, but Increase in Proportion of Heavy Drinkers.","Rossow, Ingeborg; Bye, Elin K; Moan, Inger Synnove; Kilian, Carolin; Bramness, Jorgen G","Little is known about possible changes in alcohol consumption distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated how individual changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic translated into changes in: (i) mean consumption; (ii) dispersion of consumption distribution; and (iii) prevalence of heavy drinkers. We employed data from two independent web-surveys of Norwegian adults collected between April and July 2020 and limited to those reporting past year alcohol consumption (N1 = 15,267, N2 = 1195). Self-reports of changes in drinking behavior were quantified, assuming change being relative to baseline consumption level. During the pandemic, we found a small increase (Survey 1) or no change (Survey 2) in estimated mean alcohol consumption (which parallels to total consumption). However, in both surveys, the dispersion of the distribution increased significantly (p < 0.001). For most respondents, an average modest decline in consumption was found. However, the small fraction with the highest baseline consumption increased their consumption substantially, and in effect, the proportion of heavy drinkers increased markedly (p < 0.001). In conclusion, quantifications of reported changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic suggest that the upper 5 to 10% of the drinkers increased their consumption and hence the prevalence of heavy drinkers increased, despite little or no change in total alcohol consumption.",2021,/,International journal of environmental research and public health,18,8,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084231,33923567,#103761,Rossow 2021,,,0,0.639741936
COVID 19 infection in a Massachusetts Community Hospital,"Davaro, Raul; Rapose, Alwyn ","Background: The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections has led to 105690 cases and 7647 deaths in Massachusetts as of June 16. Method(s): The study was conducted at Saint Vincent Hospital, an academic health medical center in Worcester, Massachusetts. The institutional review board approved this case series as minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice and waived the requirement for informed consent. All consecutive patients who were sufficiently medically ill to require hospital admission with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample were included. Result(s): A total of 109 consecutive patients with COVID 19 were admitted between March 15 and May 31. Sixty one percent were men, the mean age of the cohort was 67. Forty one patients (37%) were transferred from nursing homes. Twenty seven patients died (24%) and the majority of the dead patients were men (62%). Fifty one patients (46%) required admission to the medical intensive care unit and 34 necessitated mechanical ventilation, twenty two patients on mechanical ventilation died (63%). The most common co-morbidities were essential hypertension (65%), obesity (60%), diabetes (33%), chronic kidney disease (22%), morbid obesity (11%), congestive heart failure (16%) and COPD (14%). Five patients required hemodialysis. Fifty five patients received hydroxychloroquine, 24 received tocilizumab, 20 received convalescent plasma and 16 received remdesivir. COVID 19 appeared in China in late 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Our study showed a high mortality in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (43%) as opposed to those who did not (5.7%). Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were highly prevalent in this aging population. Our cohort was too small to explore the impact of treatment with remdesivir, tocilizumab or convalescent plasma.

Use of Electrocardiographic Screening to Clear Athletes for Return to Sports Following COVID-19 Infection,"Erickson, Jacob L.; Gende, Alecia; McEleney, Mark; Wencl, Corey M.; Castaneda, Marisa; Gran, Lindsay; Jagim, Andrew R.; Poterucha, Joseph T.; Fischer, Karen M.; Luedke, Joel; Collum, Jill ","Objective: To quantify the occurrence rate of abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we studied adult patients (>18 years old) who were participating in collegiate athletics and previously tested positive for COVID-19 between August 1, 2020, and December 30, 2020. The athletes underwent general examinations and ECG screening prior to being medically cleared for a return to sports following their COVID-19 diagnosis. Predetermined predictors were grouped into categorical variables including (1) sex, (2) symptom severity, and (3) body mass index (normal vs overweight [>=24 kg/m2]). These variables were used to examine differences of abnormal rates that occurred between different predictor categories. Result(s): Of the 170 athletes screened, 6 (3.5%) presented with abnormal ECG findings and were referred to cardiologists. We found no evidence that sex, symptom severity, and body mass index category were associated with a higher rate of abnormal ECG findings (all P>.05). Greater severity of COVID-19 symptoms was associated with a higher percentage of ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes, and the presence of fragmented QRS complex. Loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, and fatigue were the most prevalent symptoms, with 38.8% (66), 36.5% (62), 32.9% (56), and 25.3% (43), respectively, of the 170 athletes reporting each symptom. Conclusion(s): Preliminary findings indicate a low risk of myocardial injury secondary to COVID-19 infection, with less than 4% of the 170 patients in our study presenting with abnormal ECG findings and a total of 16 patients (9.4%) requiring referral to a cardiologist.

POS-628 THE IMPACT OF OBESITY ON ADVERSE OUTCOME OF COVID-19 IN PATIENTS ON MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS DUE TO DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE,"Zeltyn-Abramov M., E.; Poteshkina G., N.; Belavina I., N.; Frolova F., N.; Klochkova N., N.; Kondrashkina V., S.; Sokolova V., N. ","Introduction: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) are at a high risk of adverse clinical course of COVID-19. The most common cause of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is a recognized risk factor of COVID-19 adverse outcome regardless of the safety of kidney function. Obesity is widely debated risk factor of adverse outcome of COVID-19. Aim(s): To study the incidence of obesity and its impact on clinical outcome of COVID-19 in patients on MHD due to DKD. Method(s): 61 patients with COVID-19 treated from 04.15.20 to 08.20.20 were included in retrospective observational study. All patients were suffering from verified T2DM (the average length >10 y) and ESKD due to DKD. Kidney transplant recipients, patients with acute kidney injury, patients on peritoneal dialysis were not included in the study. Data were collected from electronic data base. The study endpoints were the outcomes of hospitalization - discharge or lethal outcome. Body mass index (BMI), general comorbidity (Charlson index, CCI), vintage of MHD, insulin dependence, plasma albumin level at admission were analyzed. Result(s): Patient's mean age 68 +/-10 y, females - 56%. General mortality in observation cohort - 40,9% (survivors - 36, nonsurvivors - 25). There was no significant difference in the groups of outcomes in age (69 +/-11 y vs 67 +/-8 y, p>0,05), gender (females: 20 (55,6%) (survivors) vs 14 (56%) (nonsurvivors), p>0,05) and comorbidity (CCI 8,3 +/-1,7 vs CCI 8,7 +/-1,5, p>0,05). The MHD vintage median was 3 y (IR 1;5) (3 (IR 1; 5) y vs 3 (IR 1; 5) y, p>0,05). The average plasma albumin level at admission - 32,8 +/-4,8 g/L (33,1 +/-4,7 g/L vs 32,4 +/-5,1 g/L, p>0,05). BMI in observation cohort was 20 - 48 kg/m2. 39 patients (64%) suffered from obesity (BMI >=30 kg/m2), 15 (38,5%) - males, 24 (61,5%) - females. The average BMI was 31,2 +/-5,1 kg/m2 (32,1 +/-4,9 kg/m2vs 30,0 +/-5,2 kg/m2, p=0,114). The analysis of variables BMI/gender in survivors demonstrated the prevalence of BMI >=30 kg/m2 in males - 68,8% and females - 70% (p >0,05), among nonsurvivors in males - 36,4%, females - 71% (p=0,178) (Fig. 1A, B). In general observation cohort 49 patients (80,3%) were treated with insulin (28 (77,8%) vs 21 (84%), p>0,05). BMI>=30 kg/m2was met among insulin depended survivors with the same frequency regardless of gender (males - 7 (58,3%), females - 11 (68,7%), p>0,05). The analysis of variables BMI/gender demonstrated the statistically significant prevalence of insulin-depended females with BMI>=30 kg/m2among nonsurvivors (p=0,019). Fig.1 Diagrams A. BMI>=30kg/m2/gender nonsurvivors (general cohort) B. BMI>=30kg/m2/gender nonsurvivors (insulin-depended) [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): The percentage of patients with obesity was 64% in the observation cohort. According to the data received, obesity is not a risk factor of lethal outcome of COVID-19 in patients on MHD due to DKD. Most survivors had BMI>=30 kg/m2. The exception was insulin-depended females with obesity, the number of these patients significantly prevailed among nonsurvivors.

Quality control practice for SARS-CoV-2 PCR acid detection: An additional quality control measure,"Layfield, Lester; Miller, Douglas; Camp, Simone; Bowers, Kelly ","Background: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recommended for those symptomatic from/or exposed to the virus. Most laboratories use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Published recommendations for quality control (QC) measures mostly rely on use of known positive and negative controls which ensure the adequacy of the extraction and PCR steps but do not measure other components of testing such as specimen contamination, technologist performance or other methodologic issues. Design(s): Following our laboratory's detection of a small number of false positive COVID-19 PCR tests in asymptomatic individuals, all samples from asymptomatic unexposed persons with SARS-CoV-2 positive tests were retested to confirm the initial result. When the second test was negative a third test was performed and a rootcause analysis of the error performed. RNA extraction and PCR were performed using the Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA) or Siemens (Munich, Germany) systems. Result(s): Approximately 21,000 COVID tests were performed in an 8-week period. During this period, 6,782 specimens were from asymptomatic persons of which 155 were positive. Replicate testing revealed 30 (19%) of these positive tests to be false positive results. Review of cycle threshold curves, locations of specimens on test plates and technologists' records revealed contamination and false positive sample located near a sample with a high viral load were the most common causes of erroneous results. Conclusion(s): Use of only known positive and negative samples appears insufficient for adequate quality control. Focused retesting appears to be a better metric to detect contamination, carry over and technologist error. We have begun a QC program in which all positive samples from asymptomatic unexposed persons, positive samples near high viral load specimens, and 1% of negative samples from exposed symptomatic patients are retested to monitor quality of technologist performance and validity of test results.",2021,/,Laboratory Investigation,101,SUPPL 1,926,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41374-021-00562-0,634717332,#98621,Layfield 2021,,,0,0.855811931
"POS-804 COVID-19 experience in the haemodialysis (HD) unit at Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa. Lessons learnt for resource limited settings","MURANDA, A.Z.; Tulleken, W.; Langa, P. ","Introduction: We have 44 chronic HD patients. Ambulatory acute patients at various stages of outpatient recovery augment numbers by up to 50%. HD patients are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) due to immunosuppression, frequent need for shared transport to the unit and potentially contaminated spaces in hospital. Mortality is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease. To mitigate risk, we officially stopped feeding patients during dialysis 21 April 2020 but the practice continued for several weeks due to staff inertia. For many indigent patients, attending dialysis is an opportunity to get a tasty meal for the day. It was clearly difficult for nurses to accept the delicate balancing act that went into the decision. Patients complained of hunger throughout the early sessions, later assuaged by the anticipation of a packed meal on departure. At the same time, mask wearing at all times became a condition for being allowed into the dialysis unit and we closed our waiting room. We instructed patients to arrive just in time and social distance in the wide hospital corridors leading to the unit. Cloth masks were privately donated for indigent patients to reduce exposure during transit to and from home. Universal mask wearing in public only became a legal requirement on 01 May 2020. We anticipated that all ill patients would dialyse at a designated COVID-19 hospital. Initially, all asymptomatic patients dialysed in a cordoned off area at the end of the dialysis ward. For practical reasons related to efficient utilization of limited dialysis staff, all positive patients now dialyse at the designated COVID-19 hospital. We permit deisloation after 21 days. Method(s): Testing recommendations in our hospital target presence of typical signs and symptoms before polymerase chain reaction testing for coronavirus RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs.The first confirmed COVID-19 case of HD outpatients was on 03 July 2020. In the interests of public health we undertook unpopular universal nasopharyngeal screening. Result(s): On 6th July we detected 6 asymptomatic positive patients of whom 4 subsequently became ill. Our second screen on 22 September 2020 yielded 1 asymptomatic positive patient who was promptly isolated. He needed to be admitted within a week with severe pneumonitis. None of these patients had attended any social gatherings. None had family members with COVID-19. Only 1 affected patient utilizes private transport exclusively [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): Universal precautions are standard for dialysis units, including hand washing, gloves, masks and aprons. On the 27th March 2020 South Africa went into hard lockdown due to an emerging corona-virus epidemic. Lockdown improved compliance and contributed to containment. Symptom based testing would have missed 7 early cases of infection, potentially exposing staff and other patients to mortal harm. Monthly screening would have allowed us to detect the two patients who became seriously ill in August earlier. Vulnerability seems to be increased by shared public transport. Crowding at hospital entrances may reasonably create opportunities for spread. As we anticipate a second wave, it is imperative that universal testing of all who access healthcare facilities be implemented. The role of antibody testing in this regard remains to be elucidated. Social issues governing exposure are a more difficult long-term challenge.

Evidence is growing that these responses are critical in SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogen paired with two distinct adjuvants, Alhydrogel (AH) or Army Liposome Formulation containing QS-21 (ALFQ) demonstrated unique vaccine evoked immune signatures. SpFN+ALFQ enhanced recruitment of highly activated classical and non-classical antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes of mice. The multifaceted APC response of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice was associated with an increased frequency of polyfunctional spike-specific T cells with a bias towards TH1 responses and more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response. In addition, SpFN+ALFQ induced Kb spike (539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells with effective cytolytic function and distribution to the lungs. This epitope is also present in SARS-CoV, thus suggesting that generation of cross-reactive T cells may provide protection against other coronavirus strains.

Thrombosis: A devastating complication of coronavirus disease 2019 infection,"Buragamadagu, Bhanusowmya; Thirumaran, Rajesh; Thota, Vihitha; Paravathaneni, Mahati; Garcia, Daniela ","INTRODUCTION: Arterial and venous thromboses secondary to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in critically ill patients is well-known. We present a unique case of devastating thrombosis in an otherwise stable patient as a result of COVID-19. METHOD(S): A 66-year-old female with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presented with suddenonset bilateral lower extremity pain after being discharged 6 days prior in a healthy state following admission for COVID-19 pneumonia. On presentation, examination revealed absent femoral pulses and loss of motor function in the right lower extremity (RLE) with decreased sensation in the left lower extremity. Bloodwork was significant for white count 12,300/muL, D-dimer 20mug/dL, and creatinine kinase 12383mu/L. CT Aorta with runoff revealed multiple acute thrombi in the pulmonary artery, infrarenal abdominal aorta, and bilateral popliteal arteries. Heparin drip was initiated, and emergent thrombectomies of the involved arteries and compartment fasciotomies of bilateral lower extremities were performed. RLE ischemia worsened despite revascularization with hospitalization complicated by severe sepsis secondary to Serratia sp. bacteremia and tissue necrosis of the RLE requiring above-knee amputation. RESULT(S): Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 infection is presumed to be secondary to a cytokine storm precipitating an acute systemic inflammatory response and activation of the coagulation cascade. While many cases of critically ill patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported, our patient is unique in that she was hemodynamically stable upon presentation. Most hospitalized patients receive VTE prophylaxis due to pre-existing guidelines. Initiating prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients is more critical as the coagulopathy from COVID-19 appears to be pro-thrombotic rather than hemorrhagic, and a higher than expected number of patients with COVID-19 limb ischemia are requiring amputation despite revascularization efforts. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on intensifying anticoagulation to therapeutic dosages in critically ill patients based on elevated biomarkers alone. We emphasize the need for conducting systematic trials to provide protocols specific for COVID-19 to decrease the incidence of catastrophic outcomes, as seen in our case.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,83,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726672.25388.c3,634766971,#102097,Buragamadagu 2021,,,0,0.619295773
Why does SARS-CoV-2 hit in different ways? Host genetic factors can influence the acquisition or the course of COVID-19.,"Monticelli, Maria; Mele, Bruno Hay; Andreotti, Giuseppina; Cubellis, Maria Vittoria; Riccio, Guglielmo","The identification of high-risk factors for the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the negative outcome of COVID-19 is crucial. The genetic background of the host might account for individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection besides age and comorbidities. A list of candidate polymorphisms is needed to drive targeted screens, given the existence of frequent polymorphisms in the general population. We carried out text mining in the scientific literature to draw up a list of genes referable to the term ""SARS-CoV*"". We looked for frequent mutations that are likely to affect protein function in these genes. Ten genes, mostly involved in innate immunity, and thirteen common variants were identified, for some of these the involvement in COVID-19 is supported by publicly available epidemiological data. We looked for available data on the population distribution of these variants and we demonstrated that the prevalence of five of them, Arg52Cys (rs5030737), Gly54Asp (rs1800450) and Gly57Glu (rs1800451) in MBL2, Ala59Thr (rs25680) in CD27, and Val197Met (rs12329760) in TMPRSS2, correlates with the number of cases and/or deaths of COVID-19 observed in different countries. The association of the TMPRSS2 variant provides epidemiological evidence of the usefulness of transmembrane protease serine 2 inhibitors for the cure of COVID-19. The identified genetic variants represent a basis for the design of a cost-effective assay for population screening of genetic risk factors in the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright Â© 2021.

Prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asia during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Hossain, Md Mahbub; Rahman, Mariya; Trisha, Nusrat Fahmida; Tasnim, Samia; Nuzhath, Tasmiah; Hasan, Nishat Tasnim; Clark, Heather; Das, Arindam; McKyer, E Lisako J; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Ma, Ping","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted biopsychosocial health and wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies suggest a high prevalence of common mental disorders, including anxiety and depression in South Asian countries, which may aggravate during this pandemic. This systematic meta-analytic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic., Method: We systematically searched for cross-sectional studies on eight major bibliographic databases and additional sources up to October 12, 2020, that reported the prevalence of anxiety or depression in any of the eight South Asian countries. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety and depression., Results: A total of 35 studies representing 41,402 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 31 studies with a pooled sample of 28,877 was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7-48.1, I 2 = 99.18%). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of depression was 34.1% (95% CI: 28.9-39.4, I 2 = 99%) among 37,437 participants in 28 studies. Among the South Asian countries, India had a higher number of studies, whereas Bangladesh and Pakistan had a higher pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression. No studies were identified from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives. Studies in this review had high heterogeneity, high publication bias confirmed by Egger's test, and varying prevalence rates across sub-groups., Conclusion: South Asian countries have high prevalence rates of anxiety and depression, suggesting a heavy psychosocial burden during this pandemic. Clinical and public mental health interventions should be prioritized alongside improving the social determinants of mental health in these countries. Lastly, a low number of studies with high heterogeneity requires further research exploring the psychosocial epidemiology during COVID-19, which may inform better mental health policymaking and practice in South Asia.

Variability of cycle threshold values in an external quality assessment scheme for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome by RT-PCR,"Buchta, Christoph; Chiba, Peter; Muller, Mathias M.; Gorzer, Irene; Camp, Jeremy V.; Holzmann, Heidemarie; Puchhammer-Stockl, Elisabeth; Aberle, Stephan W.; Mayerhofer, Maximilian ","The qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR are used for initial diagnosis and follow-up of Covid-19 patients and asymptomatic virus carriers. However, clinical decision-making and health management policies often are based additionally on cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., quantitative results) to guide patient care, segregation and discharge management of individuals testing positive. Therefore, an analysis of inter-protocol variability is needed to assess the comparability of the quantitative results. Ct values reported in a SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection external quality assessment challenge were analyzed. Three positive and two negative samples were distributed to participating test laboratories. Qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative results (Ct values) were assessed. A total of 66 laboratories participated, contributing results from 101 distinct test systems and reporting Ct values for a total of 92 different protocols. In all three positive samples, the means of the Ct values for the E-, N-, S-, RdRp-, and ORF1ab-genes varied by less than two cycles. However, 7.7% of reported results deviated by more than +/-4.0 (maximum 18.0) cycles from the respective individual means. These larger deviations appear to be systematic errors. In an attempt to use PCR diagnostics beyond the identification of infected individuals, laboratories are frequently requested to report Ct values along with a qualitative result. This study highlights the limitations of interpreting Ct values from the various SARS-CoV genome detection protocols and suggests that standardization is necessary in the reporting of Ct values with respect to the target gene.

SARS-CoV-2 host diversity: An update of natural infections and experimental evidence,"Hossain, Md. Golzar; Javed, Aneela; Akter, Sharmin; Saha, Sukumar ","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic threat. This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dogs might be secondary hosts during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne routes. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic. In this review, we summarize the natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with the latest researches conducted in this field. This review will be helpful to think insights of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, spread, and demand for seroprevalence studies, especially in companion animals.Copyright Â© 2021",2021,/,"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection",54,2,175-181,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.06.006,2006941989,#106109,Hossain 2021,,,0,0.156165291
Antibiotic Resistance In Diabetic Foot Infection: How It Changed With COVID-19 Pandemic In A Tertiary Care Center.,"Caruso, Paola; Ida Maiorino, Maria; Macera, Margherita; Signoriello, Giuseppe; Castellano, Laura; Scappaticcio, Lorenzo; Longo, Miriam; Gicchino, Maurizio; Campitiello, Ferdinando; Bellastella, Giuseppe; Coppola, Nicola; Esposito, Katherine","AIM: To investigate the rate of antibiotic resistance and its main risk factors in a population of patients with diabetic foot infection (DFI) during the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison with the population of 2019., METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-five patients with DFI were admitted in a tertiary care center from January 2019 to December 2020. Antibiotic resistance was evaluated by microbiological examination of soft tissues' or bone's biopsy., RESULTS: Compared with 2019 group (n=105), 2020 group (n=120) had a significantly higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance [2019 vs 2020, 36% vs 63%, P = <0.001] and more often was admitted with recent or current antibiotic therapy (18% vs 52%, P = <0.001), which was frequently self-administered (5% vs 30%, P = 0.032). The risk of antibiotic resistance was also higher in 2020 group [OR 95% CI, 2.90 (1.68 to 4.99)]. Prior hospitalization, antibiotic self-administration and antibiotic prescription by general practitioners resulted as independent predictors of antibiotic resistance., CONCLUSIONS: In a population of people with DFI admitted in a tertiary care center during the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was higher than 2019. Previous hospitalization, antibiotic self-administration /prescription by general practitioners were related to higher risk of antibiotic resistant infections. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Conformational Changes of the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Prediction of a B-Cell Antigenic Epitope Using Structural Data.,"Khare, Sangeeta; Azevedo, Marli; Parajuli, Pravin; Gokulan, Kuppan","COVID-19, the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is now a worldwide pandemic with mortality in hundreds of thousands as infections continue to increase. Containing the spread of this viral infection and decreasing the mortality rate is a major challenge. Identifying appropriate antigenic epitopes from the viral proteins is a very important task for vaccine production and the development of diagnostic kits and antibody therapy. A novel antigenic epitope would be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can distinguish infections caused by common cold viruses. In this study two approaches are employed to identify both continuous and conformational B-cell antigenic epitopes. To achieve this goal, we modeled a complete structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein using recently deposited coordinates (6vxx, 6vsb, and 6w41) in the protein data bank. In addition, we also modeled the RBD-ACE2 receptor complex for SARS-CoV-2 using the SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex (3D0J) as a reference model. Finally, structure based predicted antigenic epitopes were compared to the ACE2 binding region of RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The identified conformational epitopes show overlaps with the ACE2-receptor binding region of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Strategies defined in the current study identified novel antigenic epitope that is specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Integrating such approach in the diagnosis can distinguish infections caused by common cold viruses from SARS-CoV-2 virus.

A perspective on covid-19 management,"Pavelic, Kresimir; Kraljevic Pavelic, Sandra; Brix, Bianca; Goswami, Nandu ","A novel coronavirus-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- outbreak correlated with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020, resulting in numerous counted cases attributed to SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Herein, we discuss current knowledge on the available therapy options for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Based on available scientific data, we present an overview of solutions in COVID19 management by use of drugs, vaccines and antibodies. Many questions with non-conclusive answers on the measures for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health still exist-i.e., the actual infection percentage of the population, updated precise mortality data, variability in response to infection by the population, the nature of immunity and its duration, vaccine development issues, a fear that science might end up with excessive promises in response to COVID19-and were raised among scientists. Indeed, science may or may not deliver results in real time. In the presented paper we discuss some consequences of disease, its detection and serological tests, some solutions to disease prevention and management, pitfalls and obstacles, including vaccination.

Rapid dissemination of the virus occurs mainly through the saliva (Flugge's droplets) and aerosol, together with nasal and lachrymal passages. The literature associated with the recent advancement in terms of rapid diagnostics and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has thoroughly studied the role of ACE2 receptors and Furin, as well as viral agent access into the host cell and its significant persistence at the level of the oral mucosa, which represents the main access to the virus. The purpose of this review was to underline the processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and novel breakthroughs in diagnostics and vaccines. Different technologies, such as the RT-PCR molecular test and the antigenic test, have been developed to identify subjects affected by the SARS-CoV-2 in order to improve the tracking of infection geographical diffusion. Novel rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic tests has been proposed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to improve the screening capability of suspected contagions. The strengthening of the vaccination campaign represents the most effective means to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent severe manifestations of the virus-different classes of vaccines have been developed for this purpose.

Emerging antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic.,"Sun, Yaping; Ho, Mitchell","SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical and preclinical stages. As of 11 October 2020, 13 human monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have entered clinical trials with three (REGN-COV2, LY3819253/LY-CoV555, and VIR-7831/VIR-7832) in phase 3. On 9 November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab (LY3819253/LY-CoV555) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. This review outlines the development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on discussing various antibody discovery strategies (animal immunization, phage display and B cell cloning), describing binding epitopes and comparing neutralizing activities. Broad-neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be helpful for treating COVID-19 and future infections. VIR-7831/7832 based on S309 is the only antibody in late clinical development, which can neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV although it does not directly block virus receptor binding. Thus far, the only cross-neutralizing antibody that is also a receptor binding blocker is nanobody VHH-72. The feasibility of developing nanobodies as inhaled drugs for treating COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases is an attractive idea that is worth exploring and testing. A cocktail strategy such as REGN-COV2, or engineered multivalent and multispecific molecules, combining two or more antibodies might improve the efficacy and protect against resistance due to virus escape mutants. Besides the receptor-binding domain, other viral antigens such as the S2 subunit of the spike protein and the viral attachment sites such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are on the host cells are worth investigating.

Whilst a number of studies have been performed worldwide on owned cats, limited data are available on stray, colony or shelter cats. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in a stray cat population before and during human outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in cities in the Lombardy region in northern Italy, a high endemic region for SARS-CoV-2, using serological and molecular methods. A cohort of different samples were collected from 241 cats, including frozen archived serum samples from 136 cats collected before the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and serum, pharyngeal and rectal swab samples from 105 cats collected during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. All pre-pandemic samples tested seronegative for antibodies against the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 using indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, while one serum sample collected during the pandemic was seropositive.

Here, we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 infection in renal patients to assess the time to viral clearance, together with the production and persistence of IgG and IgM antibody response, in consideration of the altered immune capacity of this fragile population., METHODS: Viral clearance and antibody kinetics were investigated in 49 renal patients recovered from COVID-19 infection: 7 of them with chronic decompensated renal failure, 31 under dialysis treatment, and 11 kidney transplant recipients., RESULTS: The time span between the diagnosis of infection and recovery based on laboratory testing (2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs in consecutive days) was 31.7 +/- 13.3 days. Three new positive cases were detected from 8 to 13 days following recovery. At the first serological determination after swab negativization, all the patients developed IgG and IgM antibodies. The semiquantitative analysis showed a progressive increase in IgG and a slow reduction in IgM., DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In subjects with decompensated chronic kidney disease, under dialysis and in transplant recipients, viral clearance is lengthened compared to the general population. However, in spite of their common status of immunodepression, all of them were able to produce specific antibodies.

How clinical characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly presented. Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases. Automated testing platforms may enhance diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the potential for human error in assays' performance.

Safe and effective vaccines are now available, including the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, which encodes for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation by 2 proline substitutions. This vaccine showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 Âµg booster vaccinations, both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series, were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although geometric mean titers versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations. Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351 appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351 virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273.

Immunopharmacological perspective on zinc in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Nikfarjam, Sepideh; Majidi Zolbanin, Naime; Nassiri, Reza; Jafari, Reza","The novel SARS-CoV-2 which was first reported in China is the cause of infection known as COVID-19. In comparison with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower but the transmissibility is higher. Immune dysregulation is the most common feature of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 that leads to hyperinflammation. Micronutrients such as zinc are essential for normal immune function. According to the assessment of WHO, approximately one-third of the world's society suffer from zinc deficiency. Low plasma levels of zinc are associated with abnormal immune system functions such as impaired chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and phagocytosis, dysregulated intracellular killing, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, decreased antibody production, and sensitivity to microbes especially viral respiratory infections. Zinc exerts numerous direct and indirect effects against a wide variety of viral species particularly RNA viruses. The use of zinc and a combination of zinc-pyrithione at low concentrations impede SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Accordingly, zinc can inhibit the elongation step of RNA transcription. Furthermore, zinc might improve antiviral immunity by up-regulation of IFNalpha through JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in leukocytes. On the other hand, zinc supplementation might ameliorate tissue damage caused by mechanical ventilation in critical COVID-19 patients. Finally, zinc might be used in combination with antiviral medications for the management of COVID-19 patients.

Prediction of ICU utilization associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,"Ridgway, Elizabeth; Pieper, John; Juang, Paul ","INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has precipitated a myriad of challenges to the United States (US) healthcare system. Predictive models have sought to forecast the extend of healthcare resource deficient in order to prepare the US healthcare system, based on the assumption that fatalities are linked to intensive care (ICU) and hospital utilization. This study aims to construct a predictive model for ICU utilization, based on COVID-19 positivity rates and COVID-19 related fatalities. METHOD(S): Data was obtained from each state's public health department dashboard and validated via the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the COVID Tracking Project databases. Data from the five states (California (CA), Florida (FL), New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY), and Texas (TX)) with the highest incidence of COVID-19 related fatalities, ICU utilization, and inpatient deaths were collected from April 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020. The rates of positive COVID-19 tests and death were utilized to construct a linear model predicting ICU utilization referenced to July 14, 2020. The actual incidence of COVID-19-related ICU utilization for each state was compared to the model using the root-mean-square-error (RMSE). RESULT(S): Linear models were created for all assessed states, except TX. For the TX model, the fit of the data was non-significant. In all cases, there was a positive linear correlation observed between daily ICU utilization and mortality and COVID-positivity rates (CA R2=0.66, FL R2=0.88, NJ R2=0.68, NY R2=0.32). The RMSE was 1.81 for CA, 0.21 for FL, 0.30 for NJ, and 0.77 for NY. As expected, incidence of ICU and hospital utilization was higher than the US average for all states assessed, except for FL. The incidence of ICU and hospital utilization in Florida remained significantly lower than the US average (ICU OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51 - 0.77; hospital OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.017 - 0.021). CONCLUSION(S): Increased ICU utilization was associated with both COVID-19-related mortality and COVID-19 positivity. Overall, for CA, FL, NJ, NY the there was a correlation between observed ICU utilization and these values.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,82,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726664.30866.70,634766955,#102096,Ridgway 2021,,,0,0.480169894
Differential plasmacytoid dendritic cell phenotype and type I Interferon response in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection,"Severa, Martina; Diotti, Roberta; Etna, Marilena; Rizzo, Fabiana; Fiore, Stefano; Ricci, Daniela; Iannetta, Marco; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Lodi, Alessandra; Mancini, Nicasio; Criscuolo, Elena; Clementi, Massimo; Andreoni, Massimo; Balducci, Stefano; Barzon, Luisa; Stefanelli, Paola; Clementi, Nicola; Coccia, Eliana","SARS-CoV-2 fine-tunes the interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral responses, which play a key role in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression. Indeed, critically ill patients show an impaired type I IFN response accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, responsible for cell and tissue damage and associated multi-organ failure. Here, the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells was investigated by interrogating an in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based experimental model. We found that, even in absence of a productive viral replication, the virus mediates a vigorous TLR7/8-dependent production of both type I and III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known to contribute to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed how virus-induced type I IFN secreted by PBMC enhances anti-viral response in infected lung epithelial cells, thus, inhibiting viral replication. This type I IFN was released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) via an ACE-2-indipendent mechanism. Viral sensing regulates pDC phenotype by inducing cell surface expression of PD-L1 marker, a feature of type I IFN producing cells. Coherently to what observed in vitro , asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects displayed a similar pDC phenotype associated to a very high serum type I IFN level and induction of anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes in PBMC. Conversely, hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 display very low frequency of circulating pDC with an inflammatory phenotype and high levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. This study further shed light on the early events resulting from the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells occurring in vitro and confirmed ex vivo . These observations can improve our understanding on the contribution of pDC/type I IFN axis in the regulation of the anti-viral state in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients. <h4>Author summary</h4> SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections and deaths worldwide, yet the role of host innate immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains only partially characterized. Innate immunity represents the first line of host defense against viruses. Upon viral recognition, the secretion of type I and III interferons (IFN) establishes the cellular state of viral resistance, and contributes to induce the specific adaptive immune responses. Moving from in vitro evidences on the protective role played by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)-released type I IFN in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we characterized ex vivo the pDC phenotype and the balance between anti-viral and pro-inflammatory cytokines of COVID-19 patients stratified according to disease severity. Our study confirms in COVID-19 the crucial and protective role of pDC/type I IFN axis, whose deeper understanding may contribute to the development of novel pharmacological strategies and/or host-directed therapies aimed at boosting pDC response since the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR313380,10.1101/2021.04.17.440278,,#102911,Severa 2021,,,0,0.102677987
Cerebrospinal fluid findings in patients with psychotic symptoms-a retrospective analysis,"Vittore, Debora; Cebi, Idil; Hoffmann, Jonatan F.; von der Ehe, Katrin; Klaus, Johannes; Vonderschmitt, Julia; Bombach, Paula; Al Barazi, Hazar; Richter, Janina; Hesse, Klaus; Eckstein, Kathrin N.; Klingberg, Stefan; Wildgruber, Dirk; Rattay, Tim W.; Hengel, Holger; Zeltner, Lena; Martin, Pascal; Tunnerhoff, Johannes; Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna; Herrmann, Matthias L. ","In current international classification systems (ICD-10, DSM5), the diagnostic criteria for psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder) are based on symptomatic descriptions since no unambiguous biomarkers are known to date. However, when underlying causes of psychotic symptoms, like inflammation, ischemia, or tumor affecting the neural tissue can be identified, a different classification is used (""psychotic disorder with delusions due to known physiological condition"" (ICD-10: F06.2) or psychosis caused by medical factors (DSM5)). While CSF analysis still is considered optional in current diagnostic guidelines for psychotic disorders, CSF biomarkers could help to identify known physiological conditions. In this retrospective, partly descriptive analysis of 144 patients with psychotic symptoms and available CSF data, we analyzed CSF examinations' significance to differentiate patients with specific etiological factors (F06.2) from patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal, delusional, and other non-mood psychotic disorders (F2). In 40.3% of all patients, at least one CSF parameter was out of the reference range. Abnormal CSF-findings were found significantly more often in patients diagnosed with F06.2 (88.2%) as compared to patients diagnosed with F2 (23.8%, p<0.00001). A total of 17 cases were identified as probably caused by specific etiological factors (F06.2), of which ten cases fulfilled the criteria for a probable autoimmune psychosis linked to the following autoantibodies: amphiphysin, CASPR2, CV2, LGl1, NMDA, zic4, and titin. Two cases presented with anti-thyroid tissue autoantibodies. In four cases, further probable causal factors were identified: COVID-19, a frontal intracranial tumor, multiple sclerosis (n=2), and neurosyphilis. Twenty-one cases remained with ""no reliable diagnostic classification"". Age at onset of psychotic symptoms differed between patients diagnosed with F2 and F06.2 (p=0.014), with the latter group being older (median: 44 vs. 28 years). Various CSF parameters were analyzed in an exploratory analysis, identifying pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) as discriminators (F06.2 vs. F2) with a high specificity of>96% each. No group differences were found for gender, characteristics of psychotic symptoms, substance dependency, or family history. This study emphasizes the great importance of a detailed diagnostic workup in diagnosing psychotic disorders, including CSF analysis, to detect possible underlying pathologies and improve treatment decisions.",2021,/,Scientific reports,11,1,7169,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86170-w,634693740,#98297,Vittore 2021,,,0,0.025927595

Here, a well curated and annotated library of 6710 clinical and preclinical molecules, covering diverse chemical scaffolds and known host targets was evaluated for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple infection models. Multi-concentration, high-content immunocytofluorescence-based screening identified 172 strongly active small molecules, including 52 with submicromolar potencies. The active molecules were extensively triaged by in vitro mechanistic assays, including human primary cell models of infection and the most promising, obatoclax, was tested for in vivo efficacy. Structural and mechanistic classification of compounds revealed known and novel chemotypes and potential host targets involved in each step of the virus replication cycle including BET proteins, microtubule function, mTOR, ER kinases, protein synthesis and ion channel function. In the mouse disease model obatoclax effectively reduced lung virus load by 10-fold.

CovidArray: A Microarray-Based Assay with High Sensitivity for the Detection of Sars-Cov-2 in Nasopharyngeal Swabs.,"Damin, Francesco; Galbiati, Silvia; Gagliardi, Stella; Cereda, Cristina; Dragoni, Francesca; Fenizia, Claudio; Savasi, Valeria; Sola, Laura; Chiari, Marcella","A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions, RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false negatives are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 h with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples. We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid-phase hybridization of fluorescently-labeled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 min. We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity we were able to identify a false-negative sample. CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows the reduction of both the amount of false-negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 h.",2021,/,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",21,7,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21072490,33916661,#103708,Damin 2021,,,0,0.222274862
Anxiety and Adaptation of Behavior in Pregnant Zhuang Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Mode Survey.,"Ge, Yuan; Shi, Chunhong; Wu, Bin; Liu, Yannan; Chen, Ling; Deng, Yuegui","Purpose: This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and adaptation of behavior of Zhuang women in China to provide more specific guidance for the social and medical practice of pregnant women during public health emergencies., Participants and Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 446 pregnant Zhuang women from obstetric outpatient clinics in four tertiary hospitals and online maternity schools in Nanning, Guangxi, between February 24 and March 1, 2020. Self-designed questionnaires and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were used., Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence rate of anxiety among women was 36.77%, and some adaptation of behavior was observed. Logistic regression analysis showed that pregnant women who had an annual household income of less than $7,000, were primiparous, went out for prenatal examination, wanted to self-monitor during pregnancy but did not know how to do it, believed that they should be strictly isolated at home and cancel prenatal examinations, and expected to receive pregnancy healthcare through teleconsultation services showed a higher risk of anxiety. Nevertheless, pregnant Zhuang women who were 22-35 years old, undergraduate-educated, and in their second trimester were less likely to suffer from anxiety., Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant psychological impact on pregnant women from ethnic minorities. Factors related to quarantine and social isolation policies appear to drive changes in behaviors and anxiety disorders. Multidisciplinary mental health services and culturally sensitive interventions are necessary for minority pregnant women, especially for low-income primiparous women in the first or third trimester.

Predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; a single centered retrospective analysis,"Harmouch, Farah N.; Shah, Kashyap; Goel, Harsh ","Background: The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been responsible for the death of over 400,000 people with a continuous rise in prevalence and mortality globally. Identifying hospitalized patients at high mortality risk is critical for triage and health-care resource management regionally, nationally, and globally. We present a retrospective analysis of predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Electronic health records (EHR) of patients admitted between March 1 and April 18, 2020 to St. Luke's University Hospital with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 were reviewed for medical co-morbidities and initial biochemical/inflammatory markers. Survivors vs non-survivors were compared using chi 2 test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify candidate variables for multivariate analysis, which were then included in stepwise backward logistic regression. Statistical analyses were done on SPSS v26 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). Result(s): Clinical characteristics, biochemical abnormalities and results of univariate regression in our cohort of 560 patients are noted in table 1. Multivariate regression revealed age, congestive heart failure (CHF), and creatinine>= 1.5 mg/dl as significant predictors of mortality while race (Caucasian), vascular disease, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin approached significance (Table 2).

Conclusion(s): We present one of the largest cohorts to date of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Age, CHF, and renal disease were significant independent predictors of mortality. Though several inflammatory markers (d-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin) initially predicted mortality, they failed in multivariate analysis, questioning their role in risk-stratifying COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Interestingly, IL-6 used in those severely ill patients to assess candidacy for IL-6 inhibitor therapy (Tocilizumab) failed to predict mortality in our study. Our analysis was limited due to its retrospective nature and unfortunately large amounts of data were missing for some variables (ESR, BNP, IL-6 levels). The missing data was due to rapidly evolving institutional protocols early during the pandemic, leading to non-uniform assessment of these markers.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S265,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa417.587,634732901,#99014,Harmouch 2020,,,0,0.119683688
Performance characteristics of five antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection: a head-to-head benchmark comparison.,"Baro, Barbara; Rodo, Pau; Ouchi, Dan; Bordoy, Antoni E; Saya Amaro, Emilio N; Salsench, Sergi V; Molinos, Sonia; Alemany, Andrea; Ubals, Maria; Corbacho-Monne, Marc; Millat-Martinez, Pere; Marks, Michael; Clotet, Bonaventura; Prat, Nuria; Ara, Jordi; Vall-Mayans, Marti; G-Beiras, Camila; Bassat, Quique; Blanco, Ignacio; Mitja, Oriol","BACKGROUND: Mass testing for early identification and isolation of infectious COVID-19 individuals is efficacious for reducing disease spread.

When can we safely return to normal? A novel method for identifying safe levels of NPIs in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations,"Bianchin, Gianluca; Dall'Anese, Emiliano; Poveda, Jorge Ivan; Buchwald, Andrea","Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, governing bodies and individuals have relied on a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which posed an acute threat to individuals' well-being and consistently impacted economic activities in many countries worldwide. NPIs have been implemented at varying levels of severity and in response to widely-divergent perspectives of risk tolerance. Now, concurrently with the introduction of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the world looks optimistically to a ""return to normality"".This work was supported by the AB Nexus seed grant from the University of Colorado. In this work, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach, combining transmission modeling with control and optimization theory, to examine how risk tolerance and vaccination rates will impact the safe return to normal behavior over the next few months. To this end, we consider a version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered transmission model that accounts for hospitalizations, vaccinations, and loss of immunity. We then propose a novel control approach to calibrate the necessary level of NPIs at various geographical levels to guarantee that the number of hospitalizations does not exceed a given risk tolerance (i.e., a maximum allowable threshold). Our model and control objectives are calibrated and tailored for the state of Colorado, USA. Our results suggest that: (i) increasing risk tolerance can decrease the number of days required to discontinue all NPIs; (ii) increasing risk tolerance inherently increases COVID-19 deaths even in the context of vaccination; (iii) if the vaccination uptake in the population is 70% or less, then return to normal behavior within the next year remains risky. Furthermore, by using a multi-region model accounting for travel, our simulations predict that: (iv) relaxation should take into account regional heterogeneity in transmission and travel; and (v) premature relaxation of NPIs, even if restricted only to low-density regions, will lead to exceeding hospitalization limits even when highly-populated regions implement full-closures. Although the simulations are performed for the state of Colorado, the proposed model of transmission and control methods are applicable to any area worldwide and can be utilized at any geographical granularity.",2021,,,,,,PPR315018,10.1101/2021.04.20.21255350,,#102957,Bianchin 2021,,,0,0.723464718

Diagnosis is usually made by an RT-PCR test from a respiratory sample. A number of tests are available for antibody detection or assessment, including rapid, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and neutralization. However, characterization of the antibody immune response is not well documented and the clinical significance of COVID antibodies remains largely unknown. In addition, comparison of results across different assay formats using identical samples has not been rigorously studied, making clinical interpretation of serologic tests difficult. Assessment of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibody and neutralization assays from blood samples in COVID-19 infected patients Methods: 1-5 serial (total 33) serum or plasma samples from 14 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by EUA authorized RT-PCR assays from nasopharyngeal specimens where tested with the following COVID-19 antibody tests: LFA rapid tests (Chembio DPP IgM/IgG, SD Biosensor Standard IgM/IgG, BTNX Rapid Response IgM/IgG), and EIA tests (BioRad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody- IgG/IgM/IgA, EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA). See Table 1 for results and EUA. Results were recorded as positive, negative, or equivocal. Additionally, antibody neutralization was assessed on matched samples. Result(s): Mean age of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was 73 years (range 65-89), 11/14 had symptoms, all were male and hospitalized (6 ICU), and 3 died. Average number of days serum was collected after RT-PCR positivity was 13.5 days (range -3 to 46 d). BTNX assay was only tested on 16 samples. Among all assays, total concordance of results was 91%. When only IgG/IgM or total antibody assays were considered, concordance of results was 96% (Table). IgA specific results were discordant in 9/33 (27%) of samples compared to other assays. Two patients were negative in all assays in serial samples collected within one week of PCR positivity. Antibody neutralization was detected, but not from all samples. Conclusion(s): In general, there was good agreement among antibody detection assays. Neutralization may reflect disease outcome.

Infected healthcare workers do not go back to work until RT-PCR has demonstrated that the virus is no longer present in the upper respiratory tract. The aim of this study is to determine the most efficient time to perform RT-PCR prior to healthcare workers' reincorporation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected using the medical charts of healthcare workers and completed with a telephone interview. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine the influence of several variables on the time to RT-PCR negativisation. The impact of the variables on survival was assessed using the Breslow test. A Cox regression model was developed including the associated variables., RESULTS: 159 subjects with a positive RT-PCR out of 374 workers with suspected COVID-19 were included. The median time to negativisation was 25 days from symptom onset (IQR 20-35 days). Presence of IgG, dyspnoea, cough and throat pain were associated with significant longer time to negativisation. Cox logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. Only dyspnoea and cough remained in the model as significant determinants of prolonged negativisation time. Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (0.48-096) for dyspnoea and 0.61 (0.42-0.88) for dry cough., CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR during the first 3 weeks leads to a high percentage of positive results. In the presence of respiratory symptoms, negativisation took nearly 1 week more. Those who developed antibodies needed longer time to negativisate. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The Adverse Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Nursing Home Resident Well-Being,"Levere, Michael; Rowan, Patricia; Wysocki, Andrea ","OBJECTIVE: Quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing home resident well-being. DESIGN: Quantitative analysis of resident-level assessment data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay residents living in Connecticut nursing homes. METHOD(S): We used Minimum Data Set assessments to measure nursing home resident outcomes observed in each week between March and July 2020 for long-stay residents (eg, those in the nursing home for at least 100 days) who lived in a nursing home at the beginning of the pandemic. We compared outcomes to those observed at the beginning of the pandemic, controlling for both resident characteristics and patterns for outcomes observed in 2017-2019. RESULT(S): We found that nursing home resident outcomes worsened on a broad array of measures. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by 6 percentage points relative to before the pandemic in the beginning of March-representing a 15% increase. The share of residents with unplanned substantial weight loss also increased by 6 percentage points relative to the beginning of March-representing a 150% increase. We also found significant increases in episodes of incontinence (4 percentage points) and significant reductions in cognitive functioning. Our findings suggest that loneliness and isolation play an important role. Though unplanned substantial weight loss was greatest for those who contracted COVID-19 (about 10% of residents observed in each week), residents who did not contract COVID-19 also physically deteriorated (about 7.5% of residents in each week). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These analyses show that the pandemic had substantial impacts on nursing home residents beyond what can be quantified by cases and deaths, adversely affecting the physical and emotional well-being of residents. Future policy changes to limit the spread of COVID-19 or other infectious disease outbreaks should consider any additional costs beyond the direct effects of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2021.

Disparities in COVID-19 severities and casualties across ethnic groups around the globe and patterns of ACE2 and PIR variants.,"Shoily, Sabrina Samad; Ahsan, Tamim; Fatema, Kaniz; Sajib, Abu Ashfaqur","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediated Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has affected millions of individuals around all corners of the globe. Symptoms and severities of infection with this highly contagious virus vary among individuals and there is disparity in the number of COVID-19-related casualties across different ethnic groups. The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Certain variants of ACE2 are known to be associated with COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular complications, diabetes, chronic lung disease, etc. In this study, we looked into the geographic distribution of disease-associated variants of ACE2 as well as closely located PIR gene to explore any possible correlation with the disparities in COVID-19 severities and casualties across ethnic groups. Frequencies of the ACE2 variants associated with COVID-19 comorbidities are higher in the European and the admixed American populations. These variants are also present with stronger pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the European and the admixed American populations. On the other hand, the variants with protective role are more prevalent in the East and the South Asian populations. Strong pairwise LD exists among the activity modifying (modifier) variants in the PIR and ACE2 genes only in the European super-population. Absence of these PIR variants in the South Asian population may contribute to the overall lower COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR) despite the dense population in this region. Copyright Â© 2021.

Effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy on psychological status and sleep quality of elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease during COVID-19 pandemic,"Song, Chang-Qun; Zhang, Yu-Yi; Wu, Zhen ","BACKGROUND With the increase of age, the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease increases in elderly patients. Due to a lack of an understanding of the disease, high psychological pressure, and other factors, the patients may develop negative emotions, which thus affects their quality of sleep. AIM To investigate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy on psychological status and sleep quality of elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A total of 120 elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease admitted to our hospital from May 2020 to October 2020 were selected and randomly divided into either a control group or an observation group with 60 patients each. Both groups were given routine medical care, such as diet care, health education, medication care, sports care, psychological care, and disease-related knowledge consultation. The observation group was additionally given mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy five times, with each intervention lasting 30 min. To ensure the completion of the study, the intervention was performed every 2 d, with each participant completing the intervention within 10 d and receiving eight times of intervention. The Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21), Mood State Scale (POMS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale (PSQI) were used for scoring before and after the intervention. RESULTS Compared with the scores before intervention, the scores of the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress and the total score of DASS-21 were significantly decreased in both groups after intervention (P < 0.05); the decrease in the observation group was significantly greater than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the values before intervention, the scores of subscales of stress and depression in both groups decreased significantly after intervention (P < 0.05); the changes in the observation group were significantly greater than those in the control group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the scores of subscales of ego, fatigue, energy, anger, and panic (P > 0.05). Compared with the values before intervention, the scores of sleep quality, sleeping time, sleeping time, sleep efficiency, sleep disorder, hypnotic drugs, and daytime dysfunction and total score of the PSQI decreased significantly in both groups after intervention (P < 0.05); the decrease in the observation group was significantly greater than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy can effectively reduce anxiety and depression in elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease during the COVID-19 epidemic, and positively improve their sleep quality.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Maternal Selenium Status has Crucial Role on Clinical Outcomes Of Pregnant Women With COVID-19 Infection.,"Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Polat, Naci; Akdas, Sevginur; Ayral, Pelin Aribal; Anuk, Ali Taner; Tokalioglu, Eda Ozden; Ayhan, Sule Goncu; Kesikli, Burcu; Ceylan, Merve Nur; Tanacan, Atakan; Tekin, Ozlem Moraloglu; Yazihan, Nuray; Sahin, Dilek","AIM: Adequate maternal selenium level is essential for immune response and healthy pregnancy. This study aimed to enlighten selenium status of pregnant women with COVID-19 and the effects of potential deficiency in serum selenium levels., METHODS: Totally 141 pregnant women, 71 of them was COVID-19 patients, in different trimesters were included in the study. Maternal serum selenium levels, demographic and clinical parameters were determined., RESULTS: Serum selenium levels of pregnant women in second (p:0.0003) and third (p:0.001) trimesters with COVID-19 were significantly lower than healthy group. Maternal selenium level was found to be negatively correlated with gestational week (p<0.0001,r:-0,541), D-dimer(p:0.0002,r:-0.363) and IL-6 level (p:0.02,r:-0.243). In second trimester serum selenium level positively correlated with WBC (p:0.002, r:0.424), neutrophil (p:0.006,r:0.39), lymphocyte (p:0.004, r:0.410) count and hemoglobin (p:0.02, r:0.323), hematocrit (p:0.008,r:0.38) status. In third trimester, it was found that maternal selenium level positively correlated with monocyte (p:0.04,r:0.353) and negatively correlated with CRP level (p:0.03,r:-0.384)., CONCLUSION: Serum selenium level was gradually decreased during pregnancy period however this natural decrease was enhanced together with COVID-19 infection. The reason might be increased selenium needs depended on immune response against infection. The decrease in maternal selenium level was found to be related with IL-6, D-dimer levels which indicates selenium role on disease progression. This article is protected by copyright.

Atypical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalised older adults,"Gan, Jasmine Ming; Kho, Jason; Akhunbay-Fudge, Michelle; Choo, Hwei Ming; Wright, Melanie; Batt, Farzana; Mandal, Amit K. J.; Chauhan, Rahul; Missouris, Constantinos G. ","Background: It is increasingly recognised that older patients may not present with typical symptoms of COVID-19. Aim(s): This study aims to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcome of older adults with atypical presentations of COVID-19. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of adults >= 65 years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution between 1 March and 24 April 2020 was performed. Patients were categorised into typical or atypical groups based on primary presenting complaint in the community. Result(s): One hundred twenty-two patients (mean age 81 +/- 8 years; 62 male) were included. Seventy-three (60%) were categorised into the typical group and 49 (40%) into the atypical group. In the atypical group, common presenting complaints were fall in 18 (36%), reduced mobility or generalised weakness in 18 (36%) and delirium in 11 (22%). Further assessment by paramedics and on admission found 32 (65%) to have typical features of COVID-19, fever being the most common, and 22 (44%) were hypoxic. This subset had worse outcomes than those in the typical group with a mortality rate of 50% versus 38%, respectively, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.27). No significant difference in mortality or length of hospital stay between the groups was demonstrated. Conclusion(s): Older patients with atypical presentation of COVID-19 in the community are equally susceptible to poor outcomes. Early detection may improve outcomes and limit community transmission. Primary care practitioners should be vigilant and consider prompt onward referral.Copyright Â© 2020, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",2021,/,Irish Journal of Medical Science,190,2,469-474,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02372-7,2006754631,#103962,Gan 2021,,,0,0.161947789
Maternal clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. A systematic review,"Novoa, Rommy H.; Quintana, Willy; Guevara-Rios, Enrique; Llancari, Pedro; Urbina-Quispe, Katherine; Ventura, Walter ","Objective: To describe the maternal clinical characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes in COVID-19-positive pregnant women. Method(s): Articles in all languages on the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women were sought from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and LILACS; China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and Wan Fang Data between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Bulletins and national reports were also searched. Result(s): From 12,168 retrieved articles, 143 were selected for full-text assessment; 33 for descriptive analyses, and 4 case-controls for meta-analysis. In 322 infected pregnant women, aged 20-45 years, the most frequent maternal comorbidity was obesity (24.2%). Forty-two (28.4%) were asymptomatic at admission. Cough (n = 148,59.7%) and fever (n = 147,59.3%) were the most prevalent symptoms. In the meta-analysis, fever (OR: 0.13,95% CI 0.05 to 0.36) and cough (0.26,95% CI 0.11 to 0.59) were lower in pregnant women with COVID-19 than non-pregnant women with COVID-19.195 (60.6%) delivered, and 125 (38.8%) remained pregnant during the study. Cesarean was reported in 99 (50.8%) women and vaginal delivery in 64 (32.8%). The main adverse obstetric outcome was premature birth (n = 37,18.9%). Thirty patients (10.3%) with COVID-19-related complications required intensive care, one (0.3%) died. SARS-CoV-2 was absent in breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta or umbilical cord blood. Conclusion(s): The maternal clinical characteristics of COVID-19-positive pregnant include frequently fever and cough; however significantly less frequently than non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Iatrogenic preterm birth is the main adverse obstetric outcome.

The contribution of testing in the fight against COVID-19: Evidence from Italy.,"De Matteis, Alessandro; Turkmen Ceylan, Fethiye B; Adrianopoli, Marina; Ertek, Sibel","BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 epidemic a few countries have rolled out widespread testing of the population, while in other countries only people requiring hospital admission are being screened. After an extensive testing strategy during the initial few weeks in the early phase of the epidemic, the Italian Ministry of Health made its testing policy more stringent. In this study we assess the contribution of the testing policy to containing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy., METHODS: The analysis is focused on the evolution of the epidemic and related health intervention in four regions where approximately 80% of the national death toll due to COVID-19 has occurred. The assumed under-estimation of asymptomatic cases has led us to make use of the number of deaths due to the epidemic to analyse the effectiveness of testing. The analysis is conducted through an autoregressive time-series approach where we use official data from the Ministry of Health., RESULTS: The results of the analysis confirm a negative relationship between the number of tests carried out and the progression of the epidemic. In particular, results reveal that the tests are particularly effective in breaking the chain of transmission when they are implemented at the early stages of the spread of the virus., CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale testing policy is recommended as a critical contribution to effectively contain the epidemic. In addition, it is highly recommended to set up all necessary measures to enable the quick scale-up of testing capacity whenever required. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

[SARS-CoV-2 incidental findings among Hamburg deaths: an epidemiological monitoring during the dynamic infection event in spring 2020].,"Klein, Anke; Langenwalder, Felicia; Heinrich, Fabian; Meisner, Kira; Schroder, Ann Sophie; Puschel, Klaus; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Lutgehetmann, Marc; Heinemann, Axel","Background: In the context of the COVID-19-pandemic, mortality and incidence are key determinants to assess the transmission dynamics and the resulting potential threat. Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases., Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8-week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed., Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death., Conclusion: A systematic PCR-based monitoring of deaths allows a more targeted detection and classification of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. A preventive contribution can be made by disclosing unreported pandemic-related cases of death.

"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial of inhaled and intranasal niclosamide: A broad spectrum antiviral candidate for treatment of COVID-19.","Backer, Vibeke; Sjobring, Ulf; Sonne, Jesper; Weiss, Anne; Hostrup, Morten; Johansen, Helle Krogh; Becker, Victoria; Sonne, David P; Balchen, Torben; Jellingso, Mads; Sommer, Morten Otto Alexander","Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is spreading globally and treatment options remain limited. A formulation of niclosamide, a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment candidate, optimized for inhalation and intranasal administration (UNI91104) was developed., Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, dose-ascending Phase 1 trial to assess the safety of UNI91104 in Denmark (NCT04576312). Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a ascending single dose in cohort 1-4 and five doses over 2.5 days in cohort 5. Inclusion criteria included a minimum 80% of predicted lung function. Exclusion criteria included severe, clinically significant allergies and current acute or chronic condition especially airway diseases. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) and pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests. The primary endpoints were defined as the frequency of reported AEs and the change of safety variables relative to pre-dose. Data from all enroled healthy volunteers receiving any amount of IMP was included in the primary analyses. The pharmacokinetics of UNI91104 was determined., Findings: The trial was conducted between 29 June 2020 and 08 August 2020. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received UNI91104 and ten placebo. No serious AEs or discontinuation were reported. Mild irritation in the upper respiratory tract following inhalation of UNI91104 was reported as most frequent AE (45 events in 26 healthy volunteers, 59% of all healthy volunteers). Nasal application was well-tolerated. There was no evidence of difference in the change of mean levels of pulmonary function tests between active and placebo group across all cohorts. Five healthy volunteers (11.4%) (1 on placebo) had signs of increased transient FeNO and 4 on active (9.1%) experienced asymptomatic drops in FEV1, which resolved spontaneously or were reversible with a beta2-agonist. Niclosamide exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following inhalation and intranasal administration., Interpretation: UNI91104, a promising candidate for inhalation and intranasal therapy against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory tract infections is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and warrants further testing in patient trials., Funding: The study was funded by Innovationsfonden Denmark and UNION therapeutics.

Racial disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations do not lead to disparities in outcomes,"Krishnamoorthy, G.; Jena, N.; Mogulla, S.M.; Khine, J.; Khosrodad, N.; Sule, A.A.; Arsene, C.; Coakley, R.; Klein, A. ","Objectives: The objective of the study is the identification of racial differences in characteristics and comorbidities in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and the impact on outcomes. Study design: The study design is a retrospective observational study. Method(s): Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States, with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. Result(s): The study included 336 Black and 408 White patients. Black patients were younger (62.9 +/- 15.0 years vs 71.8 +/- 16.4, P < .001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4 +/- 8.6 kg/m2 vs 28.8 +/- 7.5, P < .001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P = .02), and presented later (6.6 +/- 5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4 +/- 5.4, P = .006) compared with White patients. Younger Black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age <65 years, 69.9%) than older Black patients (age >65 years, 39.2%) and younger White patients (age < 65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (Black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P = .08). Mortality was not higher in Black patients (65/335 vs. 142/406 in White patients, odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.37 to 0.99, 2-sided P = .05) in multivariate analysis, accounting for other risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusion(s): Higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in young Black populations may be the critical factor driving disproportionate COVID-19 hospitalizations in Black populations.

Emerging materials for the electrochemical detection of COVID-19.,"Balkourani, G; Brouzgou, A; Archonti, M; Papandrianos, N; Song, S; Tsiakaras, P","The SARS-CoV-2 virus is still causing a dramatic loss of human lives worldwide, constituting an unprecedented challenge for the society, public health and economy, to overcome. The up-to-date diagnostic tests, PCR, antibody ELISA and Rapid Antigen, require special equipment, hours of analysis and special staff. For this reason, many research groups have focused recently on the design and development of electrochemical biosensors for the SARS-CoV-2 detection, indicating that they can play a significant role in controlling COVID disease. In this review we thoroughly discuss the transducer electrode nanomaterials investigated in order to improve the sensitivity, specificity and response time of the as-developed SARS-CoV-2 electrochemical biosensors. Particularly, the Au-based and carbon or graphene-based electrodes are the two main material groups that were explored. Additionally, the adopted electrochemical detection techniques are also discussed, highlighting their pros and cos. The nanomaterial-based electrochemical biosensors could enable a fast, accurate and without special cost, virus detection. However, it is necessary further research to be done in terms of various nanomaterials and novel synthesis strategies in order the SARS-CoV-2 biosensors to be commercialized.

How do employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers? A systematic review.,"Shields, M; Dimov, S; Kavanagh, A; Milner, A; Spittal, M J; King, T L","PURPOSE: To assess the quality of the research about how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers, and to summarize the available evidence., METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged <= 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged <= 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool., RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.",2021,/,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,,"uvp, 8804358",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02077-x,33866384,#101511,Shields 2021,,,0,0.115933291
The European Green Deal - More Than Climate Neutrality.,"Wolf, Sarah; Teitge, Jonas; Mielke, Jahel; Schutze, Franziska; Jaeger, Carlo","The European Green Deal aims at climate neutrality for Europe by 2050, implying a significant acceleration of emission reductions. To gain the necessary support, it needs to reduce regional and social inequalities in Europe. We present objectives in terms of jobs, growth and price stability to complement the emission reduction targets and sketch a proof-of-concept investment profile for reaching these goals. Substantial additional annual public investments, of about 1.8% of pre-COVID-19 GDP, are proposed for the next decade. Their allocation includes retrofitting the European building stock, consciously fostering a renewal of the European innovation system as well as complementary measures in the fields of education and health. The scenario outlined in this article is meant as an input to the urgently needed discussion on how the European Green Deal can shift the EU economy to a new development path that realises a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050 while strengthening European cohesion.

Prevalence of HIV in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and associated mortality outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ssentongo, Paddy; Ssentongo, Anna E.; Heilbrunn, Emily S.; Du, Ping ","Background: As of June 3rd, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of novel SARSCoV- 2, the causative agent of COVID-19, was approximately 6,538,456, with 386,503 deaths globally. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are particularly susceptible to and more likely to die from Covid-19. However, individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are unique due to their use of antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, which have been used to treat COVID-19. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and prevalence of HIV in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and delineating the mortality rates. Method(s): MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases and medrxiv. org were searched from January 1st, 2020, to June 15th, 2020. Studies reporting on the prevalence of HIV among hospitalized COVID-19 patients among and outcome of mortality were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed proportions and risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Result(s): A total of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified from 14 studies (United States 8, Spain 3, China 1, Italy1, and Germany 1). The pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22 % [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%. When we stratified the analysis by country, pooled HIV prevalence among COVID- 19 patients in United States (1.43%, 95% CI: 0.98% -2.07%) was significantly higher compared to Spain (0.26%, 95% CI: 0.23%-0.29%) but not different from China (0.99 %, 95% CI: 0.25 %-3.85%). The pooled mortality rates in HIV-positive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 14.1 % 95% CI: 5.78%-30.50% and was substantially higher in the United States compared to other countries. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of HIV among COVID-19 patients may be higher compared to the general population, suggesting higher susceptibility to COVID-19. The mortality rates are high but vary significantly across countries.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S266,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa417.588,634732918,#99017,Ssentongo 2020,,,0,0.492388486

Immunoinformatic Responses of Host MHC I/II and CD4+ Cells Against Conserved Spike Fragments of SARS CoV-2 of 186 Countries With In-Silico Mutations: Implications in Universal Vaccination,"Maiti, Smarajit; Banerjee, Amrita; Kanwar, Mehak; Santra, Dipannita","Different types of quickly-developed vaccines have been introduced against Covid-19 with largely inconclusive results. On the course of time, somewhere Covid-19 declines its infection/mortality rate and in some countries it revived with some new mutant-variants. Considering the large number of global variants, in the current study several conserved (186 countries) sequences (checked by ClustalX2) epitopic regions (by SVMTriP and IEDB) and in-silico mutants of SARS CoV-2 spike protein fragments (Cut 1-4) were screened for their stability against proteases, antigenicity (VaxiJen V2.0 and for glycosylation effects NetOGlyc-NetNGlyc), MHCI/II reactivity (IEDB TOOLS) and CD4+ cellular responses utilizing Haddock 2.4 and PatchDock programme. The cut4 mutant and its peptide SRLFRKSNLKPFERD showed highest combined-score 48.23548 and Immunogenicity-Score of 92.0887. The core-sequence SRLFRKSNL showed highest Median Percentile Rank (7 HLA-allele) of 19. CD4+ immunogenicity also confirms representation of CUT4TM2 epitope SRLFRKSNL by MHC Class II. The epitope YNYKYRLFR from CUT4 showed IC50 value of ~30 nM with allele HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01. Binding affinity and RMSD score suggest that different epitopic regions of Cut4 mutants interacted MHC II with large number of H-bonds. Cut4 double mutants strongly interacted with exposed T-cell surface and facilitated by its receptors. According to the antigenicity analysis, epitopes 3, 4, and 5 were the potent antigens with antigenicity values of 0.6268, 1.2404, and 0.4639, respectively. Screening of conserved SARS CoV-2 spike fragments globally may help to find most stable antigenic determinant and further their mutation-engendered counterparts have better immunogenic responses.

The callers' characteristic could help us to study their experiences of emotional distress, as well as the reasons for calling during the pandemic, which can be used to inform future service design and delivery., METHODS: The information of 1558 callers called our hospital' s hotline for help from February 3, 2020, to March 16, 2020 were collected in the form of Tick-box and Free text, and the inductive content analysis was undertaken focusing on the reasons for caller engagement., RESULTS: It was indicated that more than half of the callers are female (59.7%), mostly between the age of 18-59 (76.5%). The average age was 37.13 +/- 13.76 years old. The average duration of a call to the hotline was 10.03 +/- 9.84 min. The most frequent description emotional state were anxious (45.1%) and calm (30.3%), with the sub-sequence of scared (18.2%), sad (11.9%), and angry (6.9%). All callers displayed a wide range of reasons for calling, with needing support around their emotion (64.6%), seeking practical help (44.0%), and sleep problems (20.3%) constituting the majority of calls. Among the subthemes, 314 callers thought the epidemic has made them upset, 198 asked questions about the epidemic, and 119 reported their life routines were disrupted. The prevalence of key reasons does not appear to differ over time. Through their feedback, 79.1% agreed that they felt emotionally better after calling, and 95.0% agreed that hotline had helped them., CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, the most concern of the public is still related to epidemics and its adverse effects.

"The association of interleukin-6 value, interleukin inhibitors, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in New York City","Maeda, Tetsuro; Obata, Reiichiro; Rizk DO, Dahlia; Kuno, Toshiki ","Since cytokine release syndrome with elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered to be associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); IL-6 inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are expected to be effective for its treatment. This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P <.05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P =.012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P =.002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P =.008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P <.001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P =.998]). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer levels were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases)., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.

This multicenter observational study evaluated the short-term clinical outcomes in recipients with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to COVID-19. Out of 452 recipients following up at 5 centers, 50 had AKI secondary to COVID-19. 42 recipients with at least 3 months follow-up were included. Median follow-up was 5.23 months [IQR 4.09-6.99]. Severe COVID-19 was seen in 21 (50%) and 12 (28.6%) had KDIGO stage-3 AKI. Complete recovery of graft function at 3 months was seen in 17 (40.5%) patients.

Development of a Novel Synthetic Glycan to Prevent Bacterial Infections and Ameliorate Respiratory Viral Infections,"Meisner, Jeffrey; Lee, Jackson; Lawrence, Jonathan; Roed, Megan; Van Hylckama Vlieg, Johan ","Background. The prevention and treatment of bacterial infections is a human health challenge. A disadvantage of antibiotics is that they often kill beneficial commensal, bacteria in addition to, pathogenic bacteria. Indiscriminate killing disrupts the homeostasis between commensal bacteria and the host gut epithelium allowing colonization of the gut by pathogenic bacteria and increases susceptibility to infections. This research was done to develop a non-antibiotic modality to prevent bacterial infections by growing, rather than killing, commensal bacteria in the gut. Gut commensal bacteria grown on carbohydrates produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support gut homeostasis maintenance and promote resistance to bacterial colonization. SCFAs have direct and indirect effects on the gut and lung mucosal immune system. They have also been linked to respiratory viral infection reduction and shown to influence macrophage function to mitigate pro-inflammatory neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. Methods. A library of over 1,500 synthetic proprietary glycans, termed Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMTTM), was synthesized using different chemical and enzymatic approaches. An ex vivo platform using fecal bacterial communities from human subjects was devised to screen MMTs for their abilities to deplete pathogenic bacteria, and modulate multiple aspects of bacterial metabolism. Results. KB109 was identified based on its ability to reduce the relative abundance of a diversity of pathogens including clinically relevant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in human fecal communities. KB109 also increased the relative abundance of prevalent commensal bacteria. Monoculture experiments demonstrated that KB109 promotes the growth of commensal bacteria, but not pathogens. Ex vivo screening revealed that KB109 consistently increased SFCA production across multiple fecal communities. Conclusion. KB109 represents an appealing activity profile and offers an opportunity to prevent enteric and systemic bacterial infections by promoting gut homeostasis and colonization resistance, and ameliorating respiratory viral infections by stimulating immune homeostasis. KB109 is under evaluation in two COVID-19 clinical studies.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S626,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.1393,634731330,#98883,Meisner 2020,,,0,0.546192516
"Factors contributing to the distress, concerns, and needs of UK Neuroscience health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cipolotti, Lisa; Chan, Edgar; Murphy, Patrick; van Harskamp, Natasja; Foley, Jennifer A. ","COVID-19 research from China suggests health care workers are at risk of distress, have specific concerns, and need support. It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics. Stratified, one-to-one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches for stress reduction and resilience, are crucial.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

As a model system, we used the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein (48 kDa) due to its stability and important role in therapeutic development. Cryo-EM structures of the N protein monomer revealed a flexible N-terminal ""top hat"" motif and a helical-rich C-terminal domain. To complement our structural findings, we engineered microchip-based immunoprecipitation assays that led to the discovery of the first antibody binding site on the N protein.

CoV-2-STs were generated from all types of donors and underwent phenotypic and functional assessment., RESULTS: We demonstrate causal relationship between the expansion of endogenous CoV-2-STs and the disease outcome; insufficient expansion of circulating CoV-2-STs, identified hospitalized patients at high-risk for an adverse outcome. CoV-2-STs with a similarly functional and non-alloreactive, albeit highly cytotoxic, profile against SARS-CoV-2 could be expanded from both convalescent and vaccinated donors generating clinical-scale, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell products with functional activity against both the unmutated virus and its B.1.1.7 variant. In contrast, critical COVID-19 patient-originating CoV-2-STs failed to expand, recapitulating the in vivo failure of CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity to control the infection. CoV-2-STs generated from asymptomatic PCR+ individuals presented only weak responses whereas their counterparts originating from exposed to other seasonal coronaviruses subjects failed to kill the virus, thus disempowering the hypothesis of protective cross-immunity., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide evidence on risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the feasibility of generating powerful CoV-2-ST products from both convalescent and vaccinated donors as an ""off-the shelf"" T-cell immunotherapy for high-risk patients.

Association of social and economic conditions with the incidence of sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Lima, Margareth Guimaraes; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Romero, Dalia Elena; Werneck, Andre Oliveira; Souza Junior, Paulo Roberto Borges de","Sleep is a fundamental aspect for maintaining physical and emotional health, as well as one's well-being. Few studies have assessed the effect of socioeconomic conditions on sleep in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to analyze the increase or incidence of sleep disorders according to demographic and economic conditions, prior to the pandemic, and according to changes in financial, occupational, and household conditions during the pandemic. This study was conducted via web access, using data from April 24 to May 24, with 45,160 Brazilians (aged 18 or older), with a sample weighted by Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) data. Change in sleep quality (outcome), monthly income, effect on family income, occupation/work, gender, age group, marital status, and change in domestic work (exposures) were reported. The percentages of onset or increase of sleep disorders and adjusted odds ratio were estimated. The chance of exacerbation of sleep disorders was 34%, 71%, and twice as high in people with income less than one minimum wage before the pandemic, in those who lost their job and in those who had a great decrease in their income/were without income, respectively. The chance of worsening sleep disorders was 82% higher in women; three times higher (OR = 3.14) in the population aged from 18 to 29, compared to the older adults; and higher with the increase in the amount of housework (OR = 2.21).

There is little data on the use of Furosemide to aid in balancing fluid and electrolytes in patients with DI. METHOD(S): Here we present an 11-year-old female with developmental delay, septo-optic dysplasia and central DI who required careful titration of a Vasopressin infusion in addition to IV Furosemide for successful management of fluid overload. The patient was admitted to our Pediatric ICU with acute Sars-CoV2 infection, respiratory failure, and ARDS (PaO2/FiO2=120). On admission, she demonstrated high volume urine output and a serum sodium level of 156 mmol/L. Her home subcutaneous Desmopressin was changed to a 0.5 mU/kg/hr Vasopressin infusion. Despite this, her urine output continued to increase; a maximum of 4L urine was voided resulting in severe hypernatremia (serum sodium of 171 mmol/L). This change occurred despite a maximum Vasopressin infusion rate of 8 mU/kg/ hr along with simultaneous adjustments in both the sodium concentration and rate of administered IV fluids. By the second day of hospitalization, a net positive fluid balance of 2.8L was noted and severe hypernatremia persisted (serum sodium of 160 mmol/L). Her ARDS continued (PaO2/FiO2 = 132). When her hypernatremia persisted into the third day of hospitalization, a trial IV Furosemide in addition to down-titrating Vasopressin was attempted. This resulted in successful diuresis (net balanced fluid status of -497 L) along with resolution of hypernatremia (serum sodium fell gradually to138 mmol/L). Her ARDS improved and the patient was extubated on hospital day 10. RESULT(S): The combination of IV Furosemide with Vasopressin infusion resulted in tailored diuresis and more controlled titration of serum sodium levels than adjustment in Vasopressin and fluids alone. These results are in contradistinction to the published literature, which endorse the use of thiazide diuretics in managing DI.* This experience highlights the potential for loop diuretics to aid in establishing desired fluid and electrolyte status in managing patients with both DI and ARDS.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,50,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726408.16912.eb,634767230,#101684,Gungor 2021,,,0,0.71097404
Therapeutic outcomes following tocilizumab administration in patients with severe COVID-19,"Kline, Jonathan; Patel, Payal; Palma, Stephanie; Pasqualicchio, Michael; Clarke, Heidi ","INTRODUCTION: Immunomodulation has been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19 to manage the hyperinflammatory state caused by cytokine release. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) monoclonal antibody approved for T-cell therapy induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and may provide benefit in COVID-19 patients with CRS. This study was conducted to assess clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ. METHOD(S): Retrospective, single center, cohort study of adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit who received TCZ between March 2020 to April 2020. All doses of TCZ were 400 mg given intravenously. A control group of severe COVID-19 patients who did not receive TCZ was randomly selected for comparison based upon similar baseline demographics (APACHE IV, SOFA score, age, gender, mechanical ventilation, multi-system organ failure (MSOF), and prone therapy). COVID-19 treatments received, temperature, inflammatory markers, mortality, diagnosis of superimposed infection and length of stay (LOS) was also collected. RESULT(S): 25 patients who received TCZ and 17 patients who did not receive TCZ were included in the study. Baseline demographics were not significantly different between the TCZ vs. control group (APACHE IV = 53 vs. 55; SOFA score = 6.7 vs. 7.2). All patients were mechanically ventilated and 88% of patients in each group were diagnosed with MSOF. Maximum temperature and inflammatory markers were not significantly different (median IL-6 = 157.8 pg/mL vs. 131.5 pg/mL). There was no significant difference between the number of patients who received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. 16 patients (64%) in the TCZ group received one dose and 9 (36%) received two doses. The mortality rate was not significantly different (8/25, 32% vs. 5/17, 29%; p = 0.86). The incidence of superimposed infection following TCZ administration was significantly higher compared to the incidence of superimposed infection at any time during admission for the control group (18/25, 72% vs. 7/17, 41%; p = 0.045). Mean LOS was 27 days vs. 19 days. CONCLUSION(S): There was no significant difference in mortality in COVID-19 patients who received TCZ. Our study suggests that patients who receive TCZ are at a significantly higher risk of infection.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,84,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726680.68854.c2,634766985,#102100,Kline 2021,,,0,0.040663108
Ultrasound-guided central vein cannulation in COVID positive patients in ICU,"Tripathi, Roshni; Parikh, Sangita N. ","Introduction: Traditionally, central lines are put blindly using anatomical landmarks, which often result in complications, such as, difficulty in access, misplaced lines, pneumothorax, bleeding from inadvertent arterial punctures, etc. *Ultrasonography provides ""real-time"" imaging, i.e., the needle can be visualized entering the vein that may result in a less associated complication. Objective(s): To perform a study regarded *Ease of cannulation. *Time consumed. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five critical care patients at the intensive care units of SVP Hospital, Ahmedabad, who needed central venous cannulation, with informed written consent. Result(s): Out of 25 patients, all (100%) cannulated successfully. In only 1 patient, carotid artery was punctured and was cannulated in second attempt. *96% of patients are cannulated in the first attempt. *Complication rate is 4%. Discussion(s): After three or more attempts at insertion, mechanical complications increase by six times compared with a single attempt. In the USG-guided approach, most patients are cannulated in the first attempt compared to a conventional method. In the USG technique, access time required is much less. In most patients where Trendelenburg's position may be difficult where USG comes like a gift.

Use of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19,"Schneider, Laura; Benninghoff, Michael; Farraj, Megan; Harrington, Nicole; Swift, Alexander ","INTRODUCTION: Severely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have been found to have an extensive cytokine mediated inflammatory response. This has been demonstrated by elevated pro-inflammatory markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Tocilizumab is an IL-6 antagonist that has been hypothesized to benefit patients with COVID-19 by reducing cytokine release. We set out to evaluate outcomes of patients who received tocilizumab at our health system. We also assessed the impact that the timing of tocilizumab administration and the presence or absence of corticosteroids had on patient outcomes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received tocilizumab between March 20, 2020 and June 10, 2020. Data collected included patient age, weight, gender, timing of tocilizumab administration, dose, concomitant therapies including corticosteroids, respiratory status at the time of tocilizumab administration, patient disposition, change in C-reactive protein, change in lactate dehydrogenase, change in liver function tests, need for renal replacement therapy, and the incidence of secondary infections. RESULT(S): Two-hundred-twelve patients received tocilizumab during the specified period. Overall, as of June 17, 2020, 165 patients (77.8%) had been discharged from the hospital, 14 patients (6.6%) were still hospitalized, 3 of those patients required mechanical ventilation, and 33 patients (15.6%) had died. Among the subset of patients who received tocilizumab within 24 hours of admission and received corticosteroids (n=97), 82 patients (84.5%) had been discharged from the hospital, 5 patients (5.2%) were still hospitalized, one of whom required mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients (10.3%) had died. Of the 212 total patients who received tocilizumab, 12 patients (5.7%) required initiation of renal replacement therapy, 4 patients (1.9%) had new onset seizure activity, and 23 patients (10.8%) developed a secondary infection as evidenced by at least one positive culture following administration. CONCLUSION(S): The early use of tocilizumab in combination with corticosteroids may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy is needed to fully assess clinical benefit.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,113,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726900.86356.9c,634767029,#102109,Schneider 2021,,,0,0.292239165

We described previously a fast, simple, and inexpensive Ni 2+ magnetic bead immunoassay which allowed detection of human antibodies reacting against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein using a minimal amount of serum or blood. A major drawback of the previously described system was that it only processed 12 samples simultaneously. Here we describe a manually operating inexpensive 96 well plate magnetic extraction / homogenization process which allows high throughput analysis delivering results of 96 samples in chromogenic format in 12 minutes or in fluorescent ultrafast format which takes only 7 minutes. We also show that His tag antigen purification can be performed on the fly while loading antigens to the Ni 2+ magnetic beads in a process which takes only 12 min reducing the pre analytical time and cost. Finally, we show that the magnetic bead immunoassay is antigen flexible and can be performed using either Nucleocapsid, Spike or Spike RBD. The method performed with low inter and intra assay variability using different antigens and detection modes and was able to deliver >99.5% specificity and >95% sensitivity for a cohort of 203 pre pandemic and 63 COVID-19 positive samples.",2021,,,,,,PPR313423,10.1101/2021.04.13.21255396,,#102920,Conzentino 2021,,,0,0.562421433

SARS-CoV-2 as an antecedent to guillain-barre syndrome,"Patel, Shivangi; Flaherty, Philip; Bostick, David; Marti, Enrique Togores; Hingwe, Ameet ","INTRODUCTION: Guillain-Barre is an immune-mediated neurologic disorder in which myopathy, paralysis and even respiratory failure can occur. Typically, the antecedent is a bacterial or viral illness. In this case, the patient was suffering from SARS -COV 2, which was complicated by this rare and severe disease. METHOD(S): We have a case of a 53-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the hospital with four days of fevers and progressive shortness of breath. Given high suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCOV 2), he underwent computed tomography scan which was consistent with atypical bilateral pneumonia. He would later be found positive for SARS-CoV 2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Other than hypoxia and coarse breath sounds throughout lung fields, physical exam was unremarkable. He was admitted to internal medicine and infectious disease was consulted. He was started on a five-day course of Remdesivir and a ten dose course dexamethasone. On day three, he began experiencing mild bilateral upper extremity weakness. Shortly thereafter his symptoms progressed to bilateral upper extremity paresis, descending paralysis, absent deep tendon reflexes, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Given patient history and physical exam findings there was a concern for Guillain-Barre which prompted neurology consultation. Nerve conduction study were performed which confirmed the diagnosis and the patient was treated with a five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). His case was further complicated by Klebsiella aerogenes pneumonia which was treated with ceftriaxone. By day three of IVIG treatment, the patient was exhibiting 2/5 strength in upper extremities. Patient had significant improvement in motor strength of bilateral upper and lower extremities by day six with only reported numbness and tingling in his hands and was successfully extubated. He was transferred out of the critical care unit and was discharged from the hospital after three weeks with persistent paresthesia in upper extremities and mild dysphagia for which he was to receive outpatient speech therapy.

Outbreaks of Covid-19 Variants in Prisons: A Mathematical Modeling Analysis of Vaccination and Re-Opening Policies,"Ryckman, Theresa; Chin, Elizabeth; Prince, Lea; Leidner, David; Long, Elizabeth; Studdert, David; Salomon, Joshua; Alarid-Escudero, Fernando; Andrews, Jason; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> Residents of correctional facilities have experienced disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19-related mortality. To protect against outbreaks, many prisons and jails imposed heavy restrictions on in-person activities, which are now beginning to lift. Uncertainty surrounds the safety of these moves. <h4>Methods and Findings</h4> We obtained system-wide resident-day level data for the California state prison system, the nationâ€™s third largest. We used the data to develop a transmission-dynamic stochastic microsimulation model that projects the impact of various policy scenarios on risks of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related hospitalization among residents after an initial infection is introduced to a prison. The policy scenarios vary according to levels of vaccine coverage, baseline immunity, resumption of activities, and use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, physical distancing). The analyses were conducted across 5 types of prisons that differed in their residential layouts, security levels, and resident demographics. If a viral variant is introduced into a prison that has resumed pre-2020 contact levels, has moderate vaccine coverage, and has no baseline immunity, 23-74% of residents are expected to be infected over 200 days. High vaccination coverage coupled with use of non-pharmaceutical measures reduces cumulative infections to 2-54% of residents. In prisons consisting mostly of dormitory housing, even with high vaccine coverage and non-pharmaceutical interventions, resumption of in-person activities is associated with substantial risk, unless there is high baseline immunity (e.g., â‰¥50%) from prior outbreaks. In prisons consisting mostly of cell housing, <10% of residents are expected to become infected, even with no baseline immunity. However, hospitalization risks are substantial in prisons that house medically vulnerable populations, even for prisons consisting mostly of cells. Risks of large outbreaks are substantially higher if there is continued introduction of infections into a prison. Some findings may not be transportable to other carceral settings, and our assumptions regarding viral variants will not be accurate for all variants. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Balancing the benefits of resuming normal in-person activities against the risks of Covid-19 outbreaks is a difficult challenge for correctional systems. The policy choices are not strictly binary. To protect against viral variants, prisons should focus on achieving both high vaccine coverage and maintaining widespread use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. With both in place, some prisons, especially those with lower room occupancy that have already had large outbreaks, could safely resume in-person activities, while continuing testing and measures to protect the medically-vulnerable.",2021,,,,,,PPR335076,10.1101/2021.05.03.21256525,,#106466,Ryckman 2021,,,0,0.99226035
Echocardiographic Abnormalities as Independent Prognostic Factors of In-Hospital Mortality among COVID-19 Patients.,"Pishgahi, Mehdi; Karimi Toudeshki, Kimia; Safari, Saeed; Yousefifard, Mahmoud","Introduction: Direct and indirect sequels of COVID-19 in the cardiovascular system are unclear. The present study aims to investigate the echocardiography findings in COVID-19 patients and possible correlations between the findings and the disease outcome., Methods: In this cross-sectional study, baseline characteristics and echocardiographic findings of hospitalized COVID-19 cases, and their correlation with mortality were evaluated.

In-hospital mortality was considered as the main outcome of the present study., Results: 680 confirmed COVID-19 cases with the mean age of 55.15 +/- 10.92 (range: 28 - 79) years were studied (63.09% male). Analysis showed that history of ischemic heart disease (RR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.08-1.19), history of hypertension (RR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), presence of embolism in main pulmonary artery (RR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.35-1.74), CT involvement more than 70% (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.1.01-1.16), left ventricular ejection fraction < 30 (RR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), pleural effusion (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.16), pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure 35 to 50 mmHg (RR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), right ventricular dysfunction (RR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.08), and collapsed inferior vena-cava (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08) were independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality., Conclusion: Our study showed that cardiac involvement is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients. Echocardiography findings have independent prognostic value for prediction of in-hospital mortality.

In this study, we evaluated humoral immune responses in 69 children and adolescents with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We detected robust IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody responses to a broad array of SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the time of acute infection and 2 and 4 months after acute infection in all participants. Notably, these antibody responses were associated with virus neutralizing activity that was still detectable 4 months after acute infection in 94% of children. Moreover, antibody responses and neutralizing activity in sera from children and adolescents were comparable or superior to those observed in sera from 24 adults with mild symptomatic infection. Taken together, these findings indicate children and adolescents with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection generate robust and durable humoral immune responses that are likely to protect from reinfection.",2021,,,,,,PPR314460,10.1101/2021.04.17.21255663,,#102945,Garrido 2021,,,0,0.945086786

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: (1) Japanese male or female patients aged >= 20 years (2) SARS-CoV-2 detected from a respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab or saliva) using PCR, LAMP, or an antigen test within 3 days before obtaining the informed consent (3) Provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: (1) Symptoms developed >= 8 days prior to enrolment (2) SpO2 < 96 % (room air) (3) Any of the following screening criteria: a) ALT or AST >= 5 x upper limit of the reference range b) Child-Pugh class B or C c) Serum creatinine >= 2 x upper limit of the reference range and creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (4) Poorly controlled diabetes (random blood glucose >= 200 mg/dL or HbA1c >= 7.0%, despite treatment) (5) Unsuitable serious complications based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator (6) Hemophiliac or patients with a marked hemorrhagic tendency (7) Severe diarrhea (8) Hypersensitivity to the investigational drug (9) Breastfeeding or pregnancy (10) With childbearing potential and rejecting contraceptive methods during the study period from the initial administration of the investigational drug (11) Receiving rifampicin within the previous 2 weeks (12) Participated in other clinical trials and received drugs within the previous 12 weeks (13) Undergoing treatment for HIV infection (14) History of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or wishes to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (15) Deemed inappropriate (for miscellaneous reasons) based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group. The nelfinavir group will be administered 750 mg of nelfinavir orally, three times daily for 14 days (treatment period). However, if a participant tests negative on two consecutive PCR tests of saliva samples, administration of the investigational drug for that participant can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigators. The symptomatic treatment group will not be administered the investigational drug, but all other study procedures and conditions will be the same for both groups for the duration of the treatment period. After the treatment period of 14 days, each group will be followed up for 14 days (observational period)., MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2. During the study period from Day 1 to Day 28, two consecutive negative PCR results of saliva samples will be considered as the negative conversion of the virus. The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: For patients with both asymptomatic and mild disease: area under the curve of viral load, half decay period of viral load, body temperature at each time point, all-cause mortality, incidence rate of pneumonia, percentage of patients with newly developed pneumonia, rate of oxygen administration, and the percentage of patients who require oxygen administration. For asymptomatic patients: incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, incidence of fever (>= 37.0 degreeC for two consecutive days), incidence of cough For patients with mild disease: incidence of defervescence (< 37.0 degreeC), incidence of recovery from clinical symptoms, incidence of improvement of each symptom The secondary safety endpoints are adverse events and clinical examinations., RANDOMIZATION: Patients will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group using the electric data capture system (1:1 ratio, dynamic allocation based on severity [asymptomatic], and age [< 60 years])., BLINDING (MASKING): Only the assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded (blinded outcome assessment)., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was determined based on our power analysis to reject the null hypothesis, S (t ,  z =1) = S (t ,  z = 0) where S is a survival function, t is time to negative conversion, and z denotes randomization group, by the log-rank test with a two-sided p value of 0.05. We estimated viral dynamic parameters by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model to reported viral load data, and simulated our primary endpoint from viral-load time-courses that were realized from sets of viral dynamics parameters sampled from the estimated probability distribution of the parameters (sample size: 2000; 1000 each for randomization group). From this estimation of the hazard ratio between the randomization groups for the event of negative conversion using this simulation dataset, the required number of events for rejecting our null hypothesis with a power of 0.80 felled 97.345 by plugging the estimated hazard ratio, 1.79, in Freedman's equation. Therefore, we decided the required number of randomizations to be 120 after consideration of the frequency of censoring and the anticipated rate of withdrawal caused by factors such as withdrawal of consent., TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 6.0 of February 12, 2021.

Twenty-two patients and 13 family members were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences and challenges caused by the pandemic and home-confinement directives. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Five overarching themes were identified: (1) changing point of reference: confusion and legitimization of OCD behavior, (2) coping strategies were challenged: too much or too little exposure to obsessional concerns, (3) distress but also relief in some areas, (4) developing a new equilibrium within the family, (5) changes in accessibility and nature of therapy: perils and merits of online treatment. These findings make clear the importance of the accessibility of mental health services during this pandemic through direct patient contacts or in a remote format. In therapy therapists should focus on challenging the changing point of reference, providing practical advice on coping, stimulating to engage in exposure and encouraging patients to seek social support. Furthermore, it is important to involve family members in therapy to support and coach them to be validating, supportive and encouraging, without accommodating to the OCD behaviour.

Aminotransferases disorders associated with venous thromboembolic events in patients infected with COVID-19,"Hamade, Amer; Woehl, Bastien; Talbot, Marjolaine; Bensalah, Naouel; Michel, Pierre; Obringer, Golnaz; Lehn-Hogg, Michele; Buschenrieder, Nathalie; Tousch, Jonathan; Jambert, Lucas; Issa, Mahdi; Stephan, Dominique ","Introduction and objectives: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that infected patients present a high incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events and elevated aminotransferases (AT).The objective of this work was to evaluate the incidence of aminotransferases disorders in patients infected with COVID-19 and to manage the VTE events associated with elevated AT. Patients or Material(s) and Method(s): We report a retrospective study of 46 patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. Venous duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed in all patients at Day 0 and Day 5. All patients had antithrombotic-prophylaxis upon admission using low molecular weight heparin with Enoxaparin. Demographics, comorbidities and laboratory parameters were collected and analyzed. Result(s): Elevated AT were reported in 28 patients (61%). 10 had acute VTE events of which eight (17.4%) had aminotransferases disorders. They had been treated with curative Enoxaparin. After a follow-up of 15 and/or 30 days, six of them were controlled, and treated with direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) after normalization of aminotransferases. Conclusion(s): The incidence of aminotransferases disorders associated with acute VTE events in patients infected with COVID-19 is significant. The use of DOACs appear pertinent in these patients. Monitoring of the liver balance should therefore be considered at a distance from the acute episode in the perspective of DOACs relay.Copyright Â© 2020 Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur, A.C.",2021,/,Annals of Hepatology,21,"(Hamade, Woehl, Talbot, Bensalah, Michel, Obringer, Lehn-Hogg, Buschenrieder, Tousch, Jambert) Service de Medecine Vasculaire, GHRMSA, Hopital Emile Muller, 20, Rue du Dr Laennec, Mulhouse 68051, France(Issa) Service de Chirurgie Digestive, GHRMSA, Hopita",100274,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aohep.2020.10.002,2010502955,#104253,Hamade 2021,,,0,0.042508923
"Structure-Based Design of a Specific, Homogeneous Luminescence Enzyme Reporter Assay for SARS-CoV-2.","Fellouse, Frederic A; Miersch, Shane; Chen, Chao; Michnick, Stephen W","Recombinant antibodies (Abs) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus hold promise for treatment of COVID-19 and high affinity and specific diagnostic assays. Here, we report engineering principles and realization of a Protein-fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) detector of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by coupling two Abs to complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of the reporter enzyme Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). Both Abs display comparably high affinities for distinct epitopes of viral Spike (S)-protein trimers. Gluc activity is reconstituted when the Abs are simultaneously bound to S-protein bringing the Ab-fused N- and C-terminal fragments close enough together (8 nm) to fold. We thus achieve high specificity both by requirement of simultaneous binding of the two Abs to the S-protein and also, in a steric configuration in which the two Gluc complementary fragments can fold and thus reconstitute catalytic activity. Gluc activity can also be reconstituted with virus-like particles that express surface S-protein with detectable signal over background within 5 minutes of incubation. Design principles presented here can be readily applied to develop reporters to virtually any protein with sufficient available structural details. Thus, our results present a general framework to develop reporter assays for COVID-19, and the strategy can be readily deployed in response to existing and future pathogenic threats and other diseases.

"Antibody Therapy: From Diphtheria to Cancer, COVID-19, and Beyond.","Kumar, Deepak; Gauthami, Sulgey; Bayry, Jagadeesh; Kaveri, Srinivas V; Hegde, Nagendra R","The dawn of the 20th century saw the formative years of developments in immunology. In particular, immunochemistry, specifically pertaining to antibodies, was extensively studied. These studies laid the foundations for employing antibodies in a variety of ways. Not surprisingly, antibodies have been used for applications ranging from biomedical research to disease diagnostics and therapeutics to evaluation of immune responses during natural infection and those elicited by vaccines. Despite recent advancements in cellular immunology and the excitement of T cell therapy, use of antibodies represents a large proportion of immunotherapeutic approaches as well as clinical interventions. Polyclonal antibodies in the form of plasma or sera continue to be used to treat a number of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Historically, antisera to toxins have been the longest serving biotherapeutics. In addition, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been extensively used to treat not only immunodeficiency conditions but also autoimmune disorders. Beyond the simplistic suppositions of their action, the IVIg have also unraveled the immune regulatory and homeostatic ramifications of their use. The advent of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), on the other hand, has provided a clear pathway for their development as drug molecules. MAbs have found a clear place in the treatment of cancers and extending lives and have been used in a variety of other conditions. In this review, we capture the important developments in the therapeutic applications of antibodies to alleviate disease, with a focus on some of the recent developments.",2021,/,Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,40,2,36-49,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/mab.2021.0004,33900819,#103379,Kumar 2021,,,0,0.055973466
Thoracic Surgery during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): The Experience of a Level 1 Trauma Center,"Smelt, Jeremy; Santhirakumaran, Gowthanan; Vaughan, Paul; Hunt, Ian; Tan, Carol ","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus primarily affecting the respiratory system, was initially diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, the virus rapidly became a global pandemic. The effects on health care worldwide were unprecedented as countries adapted services to treat masses of critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic had on thoracic surgery at a major trauma center during peak prevalence. Methods Prospective unit data were collected for all patients who underwent thoracic surgery during March 2020 until May 2020 inclusive. Retrospective data were collected from an earlier comparable time period as a comparison. Results In the aforementioned time frame, 117 thoracic surgical operations were performed under the care of four thoracic surgeons. Six operations were performed on three patients who were being treated for SARS-CoV-2. One operation was performed on a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2. There were no deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 in any patient undergoing thoracic surgery. Conclusion This study demonstrates that during the first surge of SARS-CoV-2, it was possible to adapt a thoracic oncology and trauma service without increase in mortality due to COVID-19. This was only possible due to a significant reduction in trauma referrals, cessation of benign and elective work, and the more stringent reprioritization of cancer surgery. This information is vital to learn from our experience and prepare for the predicted second surge and any similar future pandemics we might face.Copyright Â© 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Up till now, there has been no clinical data with regards to COVID-19 from Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). The aim was to report on the first cohort of patients from B&H and to analyze factors that influence COVID-19 patient's length of hospitalization (LOH)., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Tuzla University Clinical Center (UKC), B&H. It involved 25 COVID-19 positive patients that needed hospitalisation between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The LOH was measured from the time of admission to discharge. Factors analyzed induced age, BMI, presence of known comorbidities, serum creatinine and O2 saturation upon admission., RESULTS: The mean age was 52.92 +/- 19.15 years and BMI 28.80 +/- 4.22. LOH for patients with BMI < 25 was 9 +/- SE2.646 days (CI 95% 3.814-14.816) vs 14.182 +/- SE .937 (CI 95% 12.346-16.018 p < 0.05; HR 5.148 CI95% 1.217 to 21.772 p = 0.026) for >=25 BMI.

A computational approach to design potential siRNA molecules as a prospective tool for silencing nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2,"Chowdhury, Umar Faruq; Sharif Shohan, Mohammad Umer; Hoque, Kazi Injamamul; Beg, Mirza Ashikul; Sharif Siam, Mohammad Kawsar; Moni, Mohammad Ali ","An outbreak, caused by an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 named COVID-19 has become pandemic with a magnitude which is daunting to all public health institutions in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, efficacy prediction and molecular docking analysis, 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exert the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,Genomics,113,1,331-343,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.12.021,2010461597,#98457,Chowdhury 2021,,,0,0.083196441
Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) as a marker for disease severity and persistent radiological abnormalities following COVID-19 infection at 12 weeks.,"Arnold, David T; Donald, Charmaine; Lyon, Max; Hamilton, Fergus W; Morley, Anna J; Attwood, Marie; Dipper, Alexandra; Barratt, Shaney L","INTRODUCTION: Acute presentations of COVID-19 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to severe clinical manifestations including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 infection includes lung fibrosis in a proportion of patients. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a mucin like glycoprotein that has been proposed as a marker of pulmonary epithelial cell injury. We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up., METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study., RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The association between high KL-6 levels at 12 weeks and persisting CT abnormalities (GGO/fibrosis), is a finding that requires further exploration. Whether KL-6 may help differentiate those patients with persisting dyspnoea due to complications rather than deconditioning or dysfunctional breathing alone, is an important future research question.",2021,/,PloS one,16,4,e0249607,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249607,33914762,#103692,Arnold 2021,,,0,0.591919145
Eighteen patients with pneumomediastinum secondary to COVID-19 at a tertiary medical center,"Valencia, Laura Melissa Rodriguez; Fidrocki, Diana; Greenbaum, Nathaniel; Guzman-Seda, Natalia; Hsuan Cheng, Tzu; Diaz, Geraldine; Sun, Natalie; Melamed, Adiell ","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is associated with significant pulmonary morbidity. We present a series of patients with pneumomediastinum (PM) at a regional, COVID-only designated hospital. Diagnosis, management, and outcomes were evaluated. METHOD(S): This retrospective study surveyed COVID-19 patients admitted to a regionally designated COVID-only hospital from March through May 2020. Patients diagnosed with PM were classified into two groups: isolated PM (PMO) and PM with concomitant pneumothorax (CMBND). Demographics, ventilatory parameters, and outcomes are included. RESULT(S): Of 772 patients evaluated, 18 patients were diagnosed with PM (2%): one-third presented with PMO while two-thirds demonstrated CMBND. Demographic data between groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, history of lung disease, hypertension, and need for mechanical ventilation. Diabetes was more prevalent in the CMBND group. Mean time to diagnosis of PM following admission was 10 days, and 6.5 days following intubation. Indication for evaluation leading to the diagnosis of PM were: incidental (44%), post-intubation chest x-ray (22%), clinical deterioration (22%), and subcutaneous emphysema (11%). At intubation, median PEEP (range) among PMO vs. CMBND was 14 (12-15) vs. 14 (10-18) cm H2O. Median PEEP (range) at diagnosis among PMO vs. CMBND was 12 (12-15) vs. 10 (8-21) cm H2O. At intubation, the median PIP (range) among PMO vs. CMBND was 33 (24-38) vs. 32 (23-55) cm H2O. The median PIP (range) at diagnosis among PMO vs. CMBND was 32 (31-45) vs. 38 (24-60) cm H2O. Median tidal volume and FiO2 for both groups were similar while observed mortality was equal (83%). CONCLUSION(S): There is no significant difference in demographic characteristics, mortality or ventilatory parameters between PMO and CMBND. PEEP dynamics were not predictive of impending PM; however, PIP increases did portend development of PM in a large subset of patients. PIP increases of greater than 40% over intubation baseline observed for a median of 8 days were associated with the development of PM. Careful attention to progressive PIP increases over several days should enhance suspicion for PM. The relationship between PIP dynamics and COVID-19 associated PM warrants further investigation.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,127,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000727012.42380.ea,634767258,#101690,Valencia 2021,,,0,0.59327958
COVID-2019 fundamentals.,"Lamberghini, Flavia; Testai, Fernando D","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified at the end of 2019. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options., RESULTS: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated., PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The elevated viral load in the oral cavity and pharynx suggests that oral health care professionals could get infected through occupational exposure. Providers should understand the variables that influence the yield of diagnostic studies because false-negative results can occur. Copyright Â© 2021.

Effect of anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients.,"Tieleman, R G; Klok, F A; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Schalkers, I; Jansen, C W; Siebelink, H J","BACKGROUND: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and stroke, has been reported. It is unknown whether anticoagulation can prevent these complications and improve outcome., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients on cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications and clinical outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 17 July 2020. After systematic analysis, eight studies were included. Analysis was stratified for the start of anticoagulation before or during hospital admission., RESULTS: There was insufficient evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation could improve the outcome in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. None of the studies demonstrated improved mortality, except for one very small Italian study. Furthermore, none of the studies showed a positive effect of anticoagulation on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy, except for two studies demonstrating an association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'low' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology., CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature showed that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of anticoagulation on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies.

Here, we describe rational antigen design through to manufacturability and vaccine efficacy of a prefusion-stabilised spike (S) protein, Sclamp, in combination with the licensed adjuvant MF59 'MF59C.1' (Seqirus, Parkville, Australia)., Methods: A panel recombinant Sclamp proteins were produced in Chinese hamster ovary and screened in vitro to select a lead vaccine candidate. The structure of this antigen was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed in mouse immunogenicity studies, hamster challenge studies and safety and toxicology studies in rat., Results: In mice, the Sclamp vaccine elicits high levels of neutralising antibodies, as well as broadly reactive and polyfunctional S-specific CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in vivo. In the Syrian hamster challenge model (n = 70), vaccination results in reduced viral load within the lung, protection from pulmonary disease and decreased viral shedding in daily throat swabs which correlated strongly with the neutralising antibody level., Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 Sclamp vaccine candidate is compatible with large-scale commercial manufacture, stable at 2-8degreeC. When formulated with MF59 adjuvant, it elicits neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses and provides protection in animal challenge models. Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

Description and analysis of characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trials registered in the clinical trials registry-India (CTRI),"Abinaya, E.; Saradha, S.; Ilamathi, K.R.; Ruckmani, A.; Arunkumar, R. ","Many clinical trials are ongoing in India to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various interventions in COVID-19. It is mandatory that the clinical trials be registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) before enrollment of study participants. The present study was carried out with the objective of collecting, compiling and analyzing various types of trial data such as study design, interventions, outcomes and study sites. The clinical trial data were collected from the CTRI web portal using the key word ""COVID-19"" on 14 July 2020. The CTRI data output of every study registered till 14 July 2020 was stored as PDF document and the data were transcribed into a validated excel sheet based on the pre-defined methods and categories and analyzed. A total of 293 clinical studies have been registered in CTRI as on 14 July 2020. Among them, 188 (64.16%) are interventional and 105 (35.83%) are observational studies. The interventions being evaluated are modern medications including drugs and biologicals, AYUSH formulations, Nutraceuticals, Yoga and Naturopathy. Most of the interventions are already in clinical use for non-COVID indications and undergoing repurposing evaluations for COVID-19 in the clinical studies. Trials with AYUSH formulations constitute more than half of the interventional studies (51.06%) while modern medications in 31.09% of the studies. 119 trials (63.3%) of the interventional studies are randomized studies. Large numbers of trials are conducted in the states where the incidence of COVID-19 is high. 146 interventional studies out of 188 are expected to be completed within 6 months and the outcomes of these studies may provide valid information on the potential treatments in COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2021 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

Understanding the outcomes of COVID-19 - does the current model of an acute respiratory infection really fit?,"Simmonds, Peter; Williams, Sarah; Harvala, Heli ","Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an acute, resolving infection followed by the development of protective immunity, recent systematic literature review documents evidence for often highly prolonged shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory and faecal samples, periodic recurrence of PCR positivity in a substantial proportion of individuals and increasingly documented instances of reinfection associated with a lack of protective immunity. This pattern of infection is quite distinct from the acute/resolving nature of other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 furthermore occurs irrespective of disease severity or development of virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intensely structured RNA genome, an attribute shared with other human and veterinary coronaviruses and with other mammalian RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus. These are capable of long-term persistence, possibly through poorly understood RNA structure-mediated effects on innate and adaptive host immune responses. The assumption that resolution of COVID-19 and the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies represents virus clearance and protection from reinfection, implicit for example in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model used for epidemic prediction, should be rigorously re-evaluated.",2021,/,The Journal of general virology,102,3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001545,633826125,#102222,Simmonds 2021,,,0,0.513865422

METHOD(S): A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period. RESULT(S): There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%). CONCLUSION(S): Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.Copyright Â© 2020 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

Modelling the effectiveness of intervention strategies to control COVID-19 outbreaks and estimating healthcare demand in Germany.,"Chadsuthi, Sudarat; Modchang, Charin","Objectives: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 caused a worldwide pandemic. This disease also impacts European countries, including Germany. Without effective medicines or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the best strategy to reduce the number of cases., Study design: A deterministic model was simulated to evaluate the number of infectious and healthcare demand., Method: Using an age-structured SEIR model for the COVID-19 transmission, we project the COVID-19-associated demand for hospital and ICU beds within Germany. We estimated the effectiveness of different control measures, including active case-finding and quarantining of asymptomatic persons, self-isolation of people who had contact with an infectious person, and physical distancing, as well as a combination of these control measures., Results: We found that contact tracing could reduce the peak of ICU beds as well as mass testing. The time delay between diagnosis and self-isolation influences the control measures. Physical distancing to limit the contact rate would delay the peak of the outbreak, which results in the demand for ICU beds being below the capacity during the early outbreak., Conclusions: Our study analyzed several scenarios in order to provide policymakers that face the pandemic of COVID-19 with insights into the different measures available. We highlight that the individuals who have had contact with a virus-positive person must be quarantined as soon as possible to reduce contact with possible infectious cases and to reduce transmission. Keeping physical distance and having fewer contacts should be implemented to prevent overwhelming ICU demand.

Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a cross-sectional study among medical school physicians and residents employed in a regional reference teaching hospital in Northern Italy.,"Dini, Guglielmo; Montecucco, Alfredo; Rahmani, Alborz; Barletta, Chiara; Pellegrini, Luca; Debarbieri, Nicoletta; Orsi, Andrea; Caligiuri, Patrizia; Varesano, Serena; Manca, Alessia; Vargiu, Maria Paola; Di Carlo, Pia; Massa, Emanuela; Icardi, Giancarlo; Durando, Paolo","OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections among medical school physicians and residents, mainly young medical doctors. The awareness of COVID-19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information., RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case. Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID-19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians. Age and loss of smell/taste were the only factors independently associated with RT-PCR positivity., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases showed a mild clinical syndrome, ranging from absence or paucity of symptoms to common cold or influenza-like symptoms. The findings of the present study increase the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis for the prompt identification and management of suspected COVID-19 cases, being particularly useful during resurges of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Understanding the Neurodevelopment of Children Born During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Hill, Rachel; Gibbons, Andrew; Nakamura, Jay; Sundram, Suresh ","Background: It is well documented that infections during pregnancy increase the risk for offspring to develop neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia. A current disturbing prospect is that in utero exposure to the novel coronavirus could disrupt the neurodevelopment of children. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of in utero exposure to COVID-19 on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Method(s): SARS-CoV2 spike protein was applied to a human microglial cell line (HMC3) to identify immune pathways activated by the virus. A mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by the viral mimetic poly-I:C, was used to map the effects of immune pathway activation on behavioural outcomes later in life. Neurodevelopmental outcomes in a clinical cohort of babies exposed in utero to COVID-19 from Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia are being monitored. Result(s): Exposing HMC3 cells to SARS-CoV2 spike protein substantially increased IL-6 protein levels in a dose dependent manner (4-fold). MIA increased IL-6 levels in the serum of the mouse dam (p=0.009) and fetal brain (p=0.04). These adult offspring displayed disrupted sensorimotor gating (p=0.01), working memory (p=0.03) and cognitive flexibility (p=0.0007) (n=19-23/group). For the clinical cohort no serious birth defects have been identified (n=8). Further outcomes from later time points (3, 12 and 24 months) are ongoing. Conclusion(s): Based on cell and animal modelling SARS-CoV2 during pregnancy may pose a risk to neurodevelopment through induction of IL-6. Further monitoring of clinical outcomes at a global scale is required to fully comprehend the significance of this risk.

Evaluation of a High-Definition PCR Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Extracted and Nonextracted Respiratory Specimens Collected in Various Transport Media.,"Buchan, Blake W; Gerstbrein, Derek; Cruz, Amorina; Hoff, Jess; Sievert, Emily; Ledeboer, Nathan A; Faron, Matthew L","OBJECTIVES: We conducted an analytic and clinical comparison of a novel high-definition polymerase chain reaction PCR (HDPCR) assay to traditional real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in upper respiratory specimens., METHODS: Analytic performance of RT-PCR, HDPCR, and extraction-free HDPCR was established through replicate testing of a serially diluted clinical specimen containing SARS-CoV-2. A clinical comparison of all 3 assays was conducted using 351 prospectively collected upper respiratory swab specimens obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals collected in various transport media., RESULTS: RT-PCR and HDPCR assays using extracted nucleic acid demonstrated similar analytic limits of detection (LoD) and clinical performance, with 100% positive and negative agreement. Extraction-free HDPCR demonstrated a 1.5 to 2.0 log10 increase in LoD based on cycle threshold values. However, clinical performance of extraction-free HDPCR remained high, demonstrating 97.8% positive and 99.6% negative agreement with RT-PCR. An overall increase in ""invalid"" and ""presumptive"" results was observed when using the extraction-free method, but this was highly variable based on transport medium used., CONCLUSIONS: HDPCR performs similar to RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of an extraction-free HDPCR protocol maintained high clinical performance despite reduced analytic LoD, with the benefit of reduced hands-on time and cost of reagents associated with nucleic acid extraction.

Dynamic Alterations of Anti-S-Protein Igg Subclasses and of Th1/Th2 Responses are Hallmarks of Acute Severe COVID-19 Disease,"Goh, Yun Shan; Fong, Siew-Wai; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Lee, Cheryl; Hor, Pei Xiang; Young, Barnaby; Chia, Po Ying; Tambyah, Paul; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Pada, Surinder; Tan, Seow-Yen; Sun, Louisa; Chen, Mark; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David; Ng, Lisa; Renia, Laurent","PurposeCOVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has a wide disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severe. While it is widely accepted that specific humoral immune responses are critical in controlling the infection, the relationship between the humoral immune response and disease severity is currently unclear.MethodsUsing a flow cytometry-based assay to detect specific antibodies against full length S protein, we compared the antibody levels between patients from different severity groups. We also analysed the cytokine profiles of patients from different severity groups by multiplex microbead-based immunoassay . ResultsWe found an association between specific IgM, IgA and IgG against the spike protein and disease severity. By comparing the ratio of Th1 IgG1 and IgG3 to Th2 IgG2 and IgG4, we observed that all severity groups exhibited a ratio that was skewed towards a stronger Th1 response over Th2 response. In addition to the strong Th1 response, patients with severe disease also developed a Th2 response, as exemplified by the smaller ratio of IgG1 and IgG3 over IgG2 and IgG4 and the smaller Th1/Th2 cytokine ratios, compared to patients with mild disease severity. ConclusionThe results suggest that acute severity or disease resolution is associated with a specific immunological phenotype. A smaller skew towards a Th1 response over Th2 response, during infection, may contribute to disease progression, while a greater skew towards a Th1 response over Th2 response may contribute to a better disease outcome. This may suggest potential therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 disease management.",2021,,,,,,PPR317533,10.21203/rs.3.rs-432867/v1,,#104540,Goh 2021,,,0,0.180787689
"PIMS-TS, the New Paediatric Systemic Inflammatory Disease Related to Previous Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Infection-""Rheumatic Fever"" of the 21st Century?.","Opoka-Winiarska, Violetta; Grywalska, Ewelina; Rolinski, Jacek","Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) is a new systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects children. Its course in many features resembles that of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Therefore, it is interesting that the experiences with ARF can be used in the management of patients with PIMS-TS. The aim of the article is to analyse the current data on PIMS-TS in relation to ARF. PIMS-TS and ARF are associated with an abnormal immune response to specific pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 and group A streptococcus, respectively). The main symptoms of both diseases are fever and cardiac involvement. Current therapy for PIMS-TS is based on anti-inflammatory treatment: intravenous immunoglobulin (first-line), intravenous glucocorticoids (second-line), or biological therapy (third-line; including interleukin [IL]-1 antagonists, IL-6 receptor blockers, and anti-tumour necrosis factor agents). Vaccination might be good prophylaxis, but the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been established in children. Interesting insights may be gained by considering PIMS-TS in light of what is known of ARF due to their similar courses, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding this disease and its pathogenesis.",2021,/,International journal of molecular sciences,22,9,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094488,33925779,#103782,Opoka-Winiarska 2021,,,0,0.070301075
A potently neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody inhibits variants of concern by binding a highly conserved epitope.,"VanBlargan, Laura; Adams, Lucas; Liu, Zhuoming; Chen, Rita E; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Raju, Saravanan; Smith, Brittany; Zhao, Haiyan; Case, James Brett; Winkler, Emma S; Whitener, Bradley; Droit, Lindsay; Aziati, Ismael; Shi, Pei-Yong; Creanga, Adrian; Pegu, Amarendra; Handley, Scott; Wang, David; Boon, Adrianus; Crowe, James E; Whelan, Sean P J; Fremont, Daved; Diamond, Michael","With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility and potential resistance, antibodies and vaccines with broadly inhibitory activity are needed. Here we developed a panel of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that bind the receptor binding domain of the spike protein at distinct epitopes and block virus attachment to cells and its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2). While several potently neutralizing mAbs protected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice against infection caused by historical SARS-CoV-2 strains, others induced escape variants in vivo and lost activity against emerging strains. We identified one mAb, SARS2-38, that potently neutralizes all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern tested and protects mice against challenge by multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains. Structural analysis showed that SARS2-38 engages a conserved epitope proximal to the receptor binding motif. Thus, treatment with or induction of inhibitory antibodies that bind conserved spike epitopes may limit the loss of potency of therapies or vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2021,/,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,,101680187,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.441501,33907753,#103253,VanBlargan 2021,,,0,0.82265829
A Novel Immunofluorescence Assay for the Rapid Serological Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Nguyen, Dung; Skelly, Donal; Goonawardane, Niluka","As of April 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 132 million individuals globally, posing an unprecedented threat to human health. There are currently no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and vaccination programmes, whilst promising, remain in their infancy. A key to restricting the pandemic is the ability to minimize human-human transmission and to predict the infection status of the population in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Success in this area is dependent on the rapid detection of COVID-19 positive individuals with current/previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In this regard, the ability to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-Spike protein in patient sera represents a powerful biomarker for confirmation of infection. Here, we report the design of a proof-of-concept cell-based fluorescent serology assay (termed C19-S-I-IFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. The assay is based on the capture of IgG antibodies in the serum of COVID-19-positive patients using cells exogenously expressing SARS-CoV-2-Spike and their subsequent fluorescent detection. We validate the assay in 30 blood samples collected in Oxford, UK, in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. Importantly, the assay can be modified to express emerging Spike-variants to permit assessments of the cross-reactivity of patient sera to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.",2021,/,Viruses,13,5,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13050747,33923271,#103758,Nguyen 2021,,,0,0.790517268

","Background: Background: Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome of Children (MIS-C) has recently emerged internationally as a serious inflammatory complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with significant morbidity for the pediatric population. Method(s): This observational retrospective cohort study includes 33 children meeting CDC criteria for MIS-C treated between March 15 and June 17, 2020 at Children's National Hospital in Washington DC. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records and are summarized. Result(s): Of 33 hospitalized MIS-C patients, 42% were critically ill, and 58% were non-critically ill. The median age was 8.9 years (0.7-18.7 years). More males (58 %) than females (43 %) were represented in the MIS-C cohort. The majority (75%) of children had no underlying medical condition. Criteria for incomplete or complete Kawasaki Disease (KD) were present in 39% of patients, while an additional 9% had some features of KD. However the remaining 52% of MIS-C patients presented with other sub-phenotypes including prominent severe abdominal pain and/or nonspecific multiorgan dysfunction. 30% presented with shock requiring volume and/or inotropic support. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 61% of patients. Virus was detectable by PCR in 36% of patients. At the time of initial evaluation, 39% (13/33) of children had identified cardiac abnormalities including myocardial dysfunction (5/33; 15%), coronary ectasia (4/33; 12%), coronary aneurysm (3/33; 9%), or pericardial effusion 5/33; 15%) either alone or in combination. Cytokine profiling identified elevation of several cytokines in this cohort, including IL-6. Treatment has included intravenous immunoglobulin, aspirin, anakinra and other immunomodulatory therapies, with overall rapid response to therapy. No deaths have occurred. Conclusion(s): The emergence of MIS-C late in the surge of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the Washington DC metropolitan region has added to the already significant burden of hospitalized and critically ill children in our region. A significant percentage of these children present with cardiac dysfunction and abnormalities, whether or not with KD features at presentation.

COVID-19 during pregnancy one year on - what lessons did we learn?.,"Nowakowski, Filip; Krajewska, Karolina; Klimek, Katarzyna; Wierzba, Waldemar; Jakimiuk, Artur Jacek","It is now more than a year since the first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) was diagnosed in China. Current data suggest that pregnancy may not only be a risk factor for the development of severe forms of COVID-19, but that the SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact on common pregnancy complications as well. Healthy pregnant women are likely to be more susceptible to viral infection and therefore are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 because of adaptive changes in their immune and respiratory systems, their altered endothelial cell functions, and modified coagulation responses. However, studies show that most pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 developed mild-to-moderate symptoms and only a few of them have required critical care facilities. In contrast with preeclampsia, preeclampsia-like syndrome can resolve spontaneously following recovery from severe pneumonia and may not be an obstetric indication for delivery. Preeclampsia-like syndrome is one symptom of COVID-19, but its cause is different from obstetric preeclampsia and therefore not connected with placental failure. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare but can probably occur. No evidence has been found that COVID-19 developed during pregnancy leads to unfavourable outcomes in the fetus. Most health authorities indicate that standard procedures should be used when managing pregnancy complications in asymptomatic women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.

improving patient safety in clinical and laboratory practice,"Segovic, Mateja; Dzajic, Anica; Petkovic, Giorgije ","Patient safety involves a set of procedures taken to avoid incidents (unintended adverse events) in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, in order to ensure the desired treatment outcome. Possible adverse events in hospital treatment are three times more common among paediatric patients than among adults, especially when dosing medications. Patient safety can be considered one of the major challenges in healthcare, especially today when the world is facing a pandemic of disease COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease form 2019). In order the unwanted errors to be identified, they need to be defined and classified. Errors in clinical practice that affect patient safety can occur before patient treatment, during patient treatment (diagnostic and therapeutic errors), but also after patient treatment. Errors are caused either by the actions of health care staff (sometimes by non-health care staff) or by the noncooperation of the patient at all stages of health care. Errors in laboratory diagnostics can occur in all phases of the laboratory cycle: in the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phase. The classification of possible clinical and laboratory unintentional and unwanted errors allows their identification, recording and implementation of corrective procedures, which will ultimately contribute to improving patient safety.Copyright Â© 2020 Croatian Paediatric Society.

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome in a postmenopausal woman after COVID-19 infection,"Argatska, Antoaneta; Nonchev, Boyan ","Introduction: There has been growing evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients present with dysregulated immune response that could lead to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases affecting multiple organs or systems. Several reports suggest possible long-term endocrine-metabolic complications in COVID-19 patients. Case Description: A 52-year-old Caucasian healthy woman with no known previous diseases or medications was diagnosed with COVID-19 respiratory infection in March 2020. She spent 2 weeks in hospital and was discharged after two negative swabs. During the following weeks had persistently high temperature, weakness, fatigue, anorexia and high inflammatory markers such as leucocytes, ferritin and C-reactive protein. Her complaints progressed over time and eventually she ended in the emergency department with vomitting, hypotonia, hyponatriemia, hyperkaliemia and impending renal failure. Considering the clinical manifestations and the laboratory findings she was found to have Addison crisis caused by primary adrenal failure. In addition, she had very high titre of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid function tests revealed subclinical hypothyroidism suggesting the development of autoimmune polyglndular syndrome type 2. She was also tested for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, antiextractable nuclear antigens antibodies, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, which were negative, but anti-parietal cell antibodies titre was positive. After managing the acute decompensation oral replacement therapy with cortisone acetate was inititated, levothyroxine sodium added in the following weeks. Three months later she needed adjustment of the replacement therapy according to the laboratory results and was left under close monitoring due to the possibility of another autoimmune disorder development. Clinical discussion: COVID-19 infection may trigger chronic autoimmune endocrine dysfunction presumably due to the complex immune dysregulation although the intimate mechanisms are not yet elucidated. The clinical features of adrenal insufficiency overlap with the recently described long COVID syndrome making the differential diagnosis challenging. It is of utmost importance to recognize the potential adrenal involvement as if left untreated may lead to serious health complications and be life-threating.",2021,/,Revista Argentina de Endocrinologia y Metabolismo,58,SUPPL 1,196,,,634781408,#102705,Argatska 2021,,,0,0.849654247
Brazilian medical students' mental health during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"Teixeira, Larissa de Araujo Correia; Costa, Ricardo Alves; de Mattos, Roberta Machado Pimentel Rebello; Pimentel, Deborah ","Objective: The objective of the research is to verify the prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional and exploratory study that evaluated 656 medical students in Brazil. Data were collected between May and June 2020, through two self-administered instruments. The first was a questionnaire prepared by the authors themselves to assess the social, demographic and cultural profile of the population. For the screening of signs of psychological distress, the Self-Report Questionnaire was used, a questionnaire with 20 items divided into four domains. During data analysis, associations between categorical variables were tested using Pearson's chi-square test. The significance level adopted was 5%. Result(s): The results show that the prevalence of individuals with signs of psychological distress was 62.8%. Risk factors for mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic are being female, being in the first two years of the course, reporting poor adaptation to Distance Learning, having difficulty concentrating, worrying about the delay of graduation, have a previous diagnosis of mental disorder, live with someone who needs to work outside the home, inability to maintain healthy habits and fear being infected by the virus. Conclusion(s): We conclude that the signs of psychological distress are high among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in urban and rural areas in the United States.,"Cuadros, Diego F; Branscum, Adam J; Mukandavire, Zindoga; Miller, F DeWolfe; MacKinnon, Neil","PURPOSE: There is a growing concern about the COVID-19 epidemic intensifying in rural areas in the United States (U.S.). In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S., METHODS: Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates., RESULTS: Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas. Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas. Copyright Â© 2021.

"Antibody response after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in relation to age, sex, and side effects","Naaber, Paul; JÃ¼rjenson, Virge; Adamson, Ainika; Sepp, Epp; Tserel, Liina; Kisand, Kai; Peterson, PÃ¤rt","<h4>Background</h4> The mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses. <h4>Methods</h4> We here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations. <h4>Findings</h4> Our findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteinâ€™s RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. <h4>Funding</h4> The study was supported by the Centre of Excellence in Translational Genomics (EXCEGEN), and the Estonian Research Council grant PRG377 and SYNLAB Estonia. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> The first studies addressing the immune responses in older individuals after the single-dose administration of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have been published. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for publications on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines, published in English, using the search terms â€œSARS-CoV-2â€, â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œvaccine responseâ€, â€œmRNA vaccineâ€, up to April 15th, 2021. To date, most mRNA vaccine response studies have not been peer-reviewed, and data on the role of age, sex and side effects on SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines in real vaccination situations is limited. Some studies have found a weaker immune response in older individuals after the first dose and these have been measured at a relatively short period (within 1-2 weeks) after the first dose but little longer-term evidence exists on the postvaccination antibody persistence. Even less information is available on sex differences or correlations with mRNA vaccine side effects. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> In this study, we assessed the antibody response up to 6 weeks after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 individuals. Our findings show a strong initial immune response after the first dose and an even higher Spike RBD antibody levels at 1 week after the second dose, but these significantly declined at 6 weeks after the second dose. We also found a weaker immune response and faster waning of antibodies in older vaccinated individuals, which correlated with fewer side effects at the time of vaccinations. Furthermore, although overall female and male vaccinees responded similarly, we found that age-related waning of the vaccine-related antibodies was stronger amongst older males whereas in females the impact of age was lost at 6 weeks after the second dose. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> New mRNA vaccines are now applied worldwide as they have shown high efficacy in clinical trials. Our results show that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induce a strong antibody response to Spike RBD region but these high levels decline 1.5 months after the second dose in most of the vaccinated individuals. Nevertheless, even at 6 weeks after the second dose, they stay significantly higher than at prevaccination, after the first dose of vaccine, or in Covid-19 postinfection. These findings also implicate that fewer adverse effects may indicate lower antibody response after the vaccination and point to the need for more individualized vaccination protocols, in particular among older people.",2021,,,,,,PPR316338,10.1101/2021.04.19.21255714,,#104516,Naaber 2021,,,0,0.295713327

This study reports characteristics of COVID-19 CP (CCP) donors and their donations to the New York Blood Center (NYBC)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All CCP data from our first day of collection on March 26th through July 7th, 2020 are included in this retrospective analysis. Donor and donation data was extracted from NYBC electronic databases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was initially performed by the NY State Department of Health, and later by NYBC using Ortho and Abbott platforms., RESULTS: CCP donor age and ABO distributions were consistent with reported lower COVID-19 susceptibility in O blood types. CCP versus whole blood donors had similar on-site deferrals, but higher post-donation deferral rates. CCP versus routine plasmapheresis donations had higher vasovagal reactions but similar product rejection rates. Changes in antibody (Ab) test platforms resulted in significant changes in the percent of donors regarded as antibody positive. Donor correlates with higher anti-spike total Ig S/CO ratios were Hispanic ethnicity, overweight BMI and longer symptom duration; and with higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG S/CO ratios were male gender, older age, Hispanic ethnicity, and fewer days between symptom onset and first donation., DISCUSSION: We identify donor characteristics not previously reported to correlate with Ab titer. Our analysis should assist with donor outreach strategies, blood center operating logistics, and recruitment of high titer donors. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

We describe outcomes in children with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir., METHODS: Seventy-seven hospitalized patients <18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection received remdesivir through a compassionate-use program between March 21 and April 22, 2020. The intended remdesivir treatment course was 10 days (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg daily subsequently for children >=40 kg and 5 mg/kg on day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg daily subsequently for children <40 kg, given intravenously). Clinical data through 28 days of follow-up were collected., RESULTS: Median age was 14 years (interquartile range 7-16, range <2 months to 17 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients had >=1 comorbid condition. At baseline, 90% of children required supplemental oxygen and 51% required invasive ventilation. By day 28 of follow-up, 88% of patients had a decreased oxygen-support requirement, 83% recovered, and 73% were discharged. Among children requiring invasive ventilation at baseline, 90% were extubated, 80% recovered, and 67% were discharged. There were 4 deaths, of which 3 were attributed to COVID-19. Remdesivir was well tolerated, with a low incidence of serious adverse events (16%). Most adverse events were related to COVID-19 or comorbid conditions. Laboratory abnormalities, including elevations in transaminase levels, were common; 61% were grades 1 or 2., CONCLUSIONS: Among 77 children treated with remdesivir for severe COVID-19, most recovered and the rate of serious adverse events was low.

Real-World Experience of Bamlanivimab for COVID-19: A Case-Control Study.,"Kumar, Rebecca N; Wu, En-Ling; Stosor, Valentina; Moore, William J; Achenbach, Chad; Ison, Michael G; Angarone, Michael P","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has strained healthcare systems with patient hospitalizations and deaths. Anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, have demonstrated reduction in hospitalization rates in clinical trials, yet real-world evidence is lacking., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study across a single healthcare system of non-hospitalized patients, age 18 years or older, with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and referrals for bamlanivimab via emergency use authorization. Cases were defined as patients who received bamlanivimab; contemporary controls had a referral order placed but did not receive bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was 30-day hospitalization rate from initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Descriptive statistics, including Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test, were performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis to evaluate independent associations with 30-day hospitalization., RESULTS: Between November 20, 2020 and January 19, 2021, 218 patients received bamlanivimab (cases) and 185 were referred but did not receive drug (controls). Thirty-day hospitalization rate was significantly lower among patients who received bamlanivimab (7.3% v 20.0%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64, p<0.001), and the number needed to treat was 8. On logistic regression, odds of hospitalization were increased in patients not receiving bamlanivimab and with a higher number of pre-specified comorbidities (OR 4.19 CI: 1.31-2.16, p<0.001; OR 1.68, CI: 2.12-8.30, p<0.001, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Ambulatory patients with COVID-19 who received bamlanivimab had a lower 30-day hospitalization than control patients in real-world experience. We identified receipt of bamlanivimab and fewer comorbidities as protective factors against hospitalization. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Gastrointestinal and hepatic abnormalities in patients with confirmed COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zarifian, Ahmadreza; Zamiri Bidary, Mohammad; Arekhi, Soheil; Rafiee, Mahdi; Gholamalizadeh, Hanieh; Amiriani, Amirhosein; Ghaderi, Mohammad Sajjad; Khadem-Rezaiyan, Majid; Amini, Mahnaz; Ganji, Azita ","Although not common, gastrointestinal and liver symptoms have reportedly been the initial presentation of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in a large group of patients. Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. After quality appraisal, data were extracted. Prevalence data from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 67 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a pooled population of 13 251 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were anorexia (10.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2%-16.4%), diarrhea (8.4%, 95% CI = 6.2%-11.2%), and nausea (5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%), respectively. Decreased albumin levels (39.8%, 95% CI = 15.3%-70.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (22.8%, 95% CI = 18.1%-28.4%), and alanine aminotransferase (20.6%, 95% CI = 16.7%-25.1%) were common hepatic findings. After adjusting for preexisting gastrointestinal (5.9%) and liver diseases (4.2%), the most common gastrointestinal findings were diarrhea (8.7%, 95% CI = 5.4%-13.9%), anorexia (8.0%, 95% CI = 3.0%-19.8%), and nausea (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.2%-14.3%). Gastrointestinal and liver manifestations are not rare in patients with COVID-19, but their prevalence might be affected by preexisting diseases. Diarrhea and mild liver abnormalities seem to be relatively common in COVID-19, regardless of comorbidities.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,1,336-350,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26314,2005688399,#99319,Zarifian 2021,,,0,0.917704346
"Evaluating first responders for SARS-CoV-2 infection in broward county, Florida","Eckardt, Paula; Goldman, Jennifer M.; Rodriguez Claramunt, Jose A.; Edwards, Courtney; Niu, Jianli ","Background: First responders (e.g., emergency medical technicians, firefighters and police) may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially spreading it than the general population due to frequent and close exposure to others. Prevention of first responder infections is important for reducing secondary transmission and maintaining health system capacity. We aimed to evaluate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection on first responders, identify risk factors for infection, and to provide health services to help control the current outbreak. Method(s): Memorial Healthcare System (MHS), a public healthcare system serving the South Broward Hospital District, together with the National Guard and Florida state governor, opened up a drive-through testing center for SARS-CoV-2 at C.B. Smith Park in Broward County, Florida. All first responders in Broward County, symptomatic or asymptomatic, were being tested. SARS-CoV-2 infection was made as a positive result of real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on at least one nasal or nasopharyngeal swab. All first responders who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 were informed by test site staff and self-quarantined to limit the spread of the disease. Result(s): A total of 3,375 individuals was tested during the period from April 1 to April 29, 2020. The median age was 42 years (IQR 33-52) and 1,464 (43%) were men. 473 (14%) were symptomatic and 2,902 (86%) were asymptomatic. 289 (8.5%) of 3,375 first responders were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included 54 of 473 symptomatic (11%) and 235 of 2,902 asymptomatic (8.1%) cases. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were comparable in male vs female (8.1% vs 8.9%, p = 0.429) and in symptomatic vs asymptomatic (p = 0.173). There is no sex-, age-based differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among the first responders tested (Figure 1). Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among first responders between April 1 and April 30, 2020 in Broward County. Conclusion(s): First responders carry a significant burden from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an infection rate of 8.5%, which was comparable in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. There is no sex-, age-based differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in first responders. High priority testing for SARS-CoV-2 must expand to include first responders, particularly asymptomatic individuals.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S293,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.643,634731684,#98902,Eckardt 2020,,,0,0.176152276
COVID-19 Aftershocks on Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease: An Early Cross-Sectional Report From the U.S. Epicenter,"Rutledge, Stephanie M.; Schiano, Thomas D.; Im, Gene Y.; Florman, Sander ","Experts have forewarned about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic environment fomenting the rising incidence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). We performed a cross-sectional study of ALD at our liver transplantation (LT) center, located in the initial U.S. epicenter, New York City. Centered around the ""stay at home"" order date in New York state, March 22, 2020, we defined three time periods: ""pre-COVID"" (January 1, 2020-March 21, 2020), ""COVID-quarantine"" (March 22, 2020-April 22, 2020), and ""declining-COVID"" (April 23, 2020-August 25, 2020). We found a 62% increase in interhospital patient transfers for ALD from pre-COVID (20 of 93, 21%) to the declining-COVID period (43 of 127, 34%). Our inpatient liver census with ALD also increased: 38% pre-COVID, 45% COVID-quarantine, and 49% declining-COVID. Among 30 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) not responding to medical therapy since March 22, 2020, 9 underwent early LT for AH (16% of the total number of early LT during our 8-year program). Three of 9 early-LT recipients reported specific COVID-related stressors. All 25 previous LT recipients with established abstinence pre-COVID maintained abstinence at follow-up visits during the declining-COVID period. Of the 6 recipients with sustained alcohol use within 6 months before March 22, 2020, half regained abstinence during the declining-COVID period. Our findings help confirm the predictions of rising AUD and ALD as an immediate consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This aftershock particularly affected ethnically diverse patients with ALD with high inpatient mortality, reflecting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underserved and minority populations. Alcohol relapse did not occur in long-term early LT for AH recipients during the time of COVID-19. This lends further support to AH being a viable indication for LT, with recipients able to demonstrate ongoing resilience in the face of this unprecedented universal stressor.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

Impact of Personal Protection Habits on the Spread of Pandemics: Insights from an Agent-Based Model.,"Alvarez-Pomar, Lindsay; Rojas-Galeano, Sergio","Background: After several waves of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are struggling to regain their economies by slowly lifting mobility restrictions and social distance measures applied during the crisis. Meanwhile, recent studies provide compelling evidence on how contact distancing, the use of face masks, and handwashing habits can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion., Methods: We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results., Results: We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds. We also found that in all scenarios, the combined effect of adhering to the three habits is more powerful than adopting them separately., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a broad adherence of the population to voluntary self-care habits would help contain unfold of new outbreaks. The purpose of our model is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of urging citizens to adopt the amalgam of personal care habits as a primary collective protection measure to prevent communities from returning to confinements, while immunisation is carried out in late stages of the pandemic.

We measured humoral immune responses in 72 HDP after standard vaccination with two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses were evaluated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ChemiLuminescent ImmunoAssay (CLIA) two weeks after the second dose. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in a control of 16 healthy healthcare workers (HCW). The control group of HCW has shown a strong antibody response with a median (MD (Q1; Q3)) antibody titer of 800.0 AU/mL (520.5; 800.0). In comparison to HCW, HDP under 60 years of age responded equally (597.0 AU/mL (410.5; 800.0), p = 0.051). However, the antibody responses of the HDP negatively correlated with age (r2 = 0.2954 p < 0.0001), leading to significantly lower antibody titers in HDP over 60 years (280.0 AU/mL (45.7; 477.0), p < 0.0001). To thoroughly understand the immunogenicity of the new mRNA-based vaccines in HDP, longitudinal data on the effectiveness and durability of antibody responses are needed. Modifications of immunization schedules should be considered in HDP with low or without antibody responsiveness after standard vaccination to boost immune reactivity and prolong protective effects in these vulnerable patients.",2021,/,Vaccines,9,4,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040360,33918085,#103318,Jahn 2021,,,0,0.988486807
Children with Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki-like syndrome (MIS-C/PIMS) at the time of COVID-19: are they all the same?

Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19. We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment. We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon.",2021,/,Reumatismo,73,1,48-53,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4081/reumatismo.2021.1331,33874647,#101313,Marino 2021,,,0,0.464422433
6-month SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistency in a Tyrolian COVID-19 cohort,"Deisenhammer, Florian; Borena, Wegene; Kimpel, Janine; Bauer, Angelika; Rudzki, Dagmar; Schanda, Kathrin; Reindl, Markus; Egeter, Jonas; Hufner, Katharina; Sperner-Unterweger, Barbara ","Background: As coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 evolved only recently, the persistency of the anti-viral antibody response remains to be determined. Method(s): We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases, mean age 44+/- 13.2 years. Except for one participant with a pre-existing diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, all other participants were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2-10 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies at 6 months. Two binding antibody assays were used, targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain. Result(s): All participants fully recovered spontaneously except for one who had persisting hyposmia. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain persisted for 6 months in all cases with a slight increase of titers, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below the cut-off point in 2 participants and showed a minimal decrease on average, mainly at month 3 of follow-up in males; however, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all samples at 6 months of follow-up. Conclusion(s): There is a stable and persisting antibody response against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at 6 months after infection. Neutralizing antibodies confirm virus specificity. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent cases is increasing sharply, antibody testing should be implemented to identify immunized individuals.

"The pathophysiology of ""happy"" hypoglycemia.","Loeb, Thomas; Ozguler, Anna; Baer, Geraldine; Baer, Michel","BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemia usually includes various neurological symptoms, which are the consequence of neuroglycopenia. When it is severe, it is associated with altered mental status, even coma., CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with severe hypoglycemia, completely asymptomatic, due to the increase of lactate production in response to tissue hypoperfusion following a hemorrhagic shock. This illustrates that lactate can substitute glucose as an energy substrate for the brain. It is also a reminder that this metabolite, despite its bad reputation maintained by its role as a marker of severity in critical care patients, has a fundamental role in our metabolism., CONCLUSIONS: Following the example of the ""happy hypoxemia"" recently reported in the literature describing asymptomatic hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients, we describe a case of ""happy hypoglycemia.""",2021,/,International journal of emergency medicine,14,1,23,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12245-021-00348-7,33882828,#101295,Loeb 2021,,,0,0.459517301
Models to inform neutralizing antibody therapy strategies during pandemics: the case of SARS-CoV-2.,"Guttieres, Donovan; Sinskey, Anthony J; Springs, Stacy L","Background: Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) can play an important role in reducing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, complementing ongoing public health efforts such as diagnostics and vaccination. Rapidly designing, manufacturing and distributing nAbs requires significant planning across the product value chain and an understanding of the opportunities, challenges and risks throughout., Methods: A systems framework comprised of four critical components is presented to aid in developing effective end-to-end nAbs strategies in the context of a pandemic: (1) product design and optimization, (2) epidemiology, (3) demand and (4) supply. Quantitative models are used to estimate product demand using available epidemiological data, simulate biomanufacturing operations from typical bioprocess parameters and calculate antibody production costs to meet clinical needs under various realistic scenarios., Results: In a US-based case study during the 9-month period from March 15 to December 15, 2020, the projected number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 15.73 million. The estimated product volume needed to meet therapeutic demand for the maximum number of clinically eligible patients ranged between 6.3 and 31.5 tons for 0.5 and 2.5 g dose sizes, respectively. The relative production scale and cost needed to meet demand are calculated for different centralized and distributed manufacturing scenarios., Conclusions: Meeting demand for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs requires significant manufacturing capacity and planning for appropriate administration in clinical settings. MIT Center for Biomedical Innovation's data-driven tools presented can help inform time-critical decisions by providing insight into important operational and policy considerations for making nAbs broadly accessible, while considering time and resource constraints.

Social deprivation as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality among women and men in the UK Biobank: nature of risk and context suggests that social interventions are essential to mitigate the effects of future pandemics.,"Woodward, Mark; Peters, Sanne A E; Harris, Katie","OBJECTIVES: To investigate sex differences in the effects of social deprivation on COVID-19 mortality and to place these effects in context with other diseases., DESIGN: Prospective population-based study., SETTING: UK Biobank., PARTICIPANTS: 501 865 participants (54% women)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death., RESULTS: Of 472 946 participants alive when COVID-19 was first apparent in the UK (taken as 1 February 2020), 217 (34% women) died from COVID-19 over the next 10 months, resulting in an incidence, per 100 000 person years, of 100.65 (95% CI 79.47 to 121.84) for women and 228.59 (95% CI 194.88 to 262.30) for men. Greater social deprivation, quantified using the Townsend Deprivation Score, was associated with greater risk of fatal COVD-19. Adjusted for age and ethnicity, HRs for women and men, comparing those in the most with the least deprived national fifths, were 3.66 (2.82 to 4.75) for women and 3.00 (2.46 to 3.66) for men. Adjustments for key baseline lifestyle factors attenuated these HRs to 2.20 (1.63 to 2.96) and 2.62 (2.12 to 3.24), respectively. There was evidence of a log-linear trend in the deprivation-fatal COVID-19 association, of similar magnitude to the equivalent trends for the associations between deprivation and fatal influenza or pneumonia and fatal cardiovascular disease. For all three causes of death, there was no evidence of a sex difference in the associations., CONCLUSIONS: Higher social deprivation is a risk factor for death from COVID-19 on a continuous scale, with two to three times the risk in the most disadvantaged 20% compared with the least. Similarities between the social gradients in COVID-19, influenza/pneumonia and cardiovascular disease mortality, the lack of sex differences in these effects, and the partial mediation of lifestyle factors suggest that better social policies are crucial to alleviate the general medical burden, including from the current, and potential future, viral pandemics.

Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to the Asialoglycoprotein Receptor on Human Primary Hepatocytes and Immortalized Hepatocyte-Like Cells by Confocal Analysis.,"Collins, Daniel P; Steer, Clifford J","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have direct or indirect effects on other human organs beyond the respiratory system and including the liver, via binding of the spike protein. This study investigated the potential direct interactions with the liver by comparing the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to human AT2-like cells, primary human hepatocytes and immortalized hepatocyte-like hybrid cells. Receptors with binding specificity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on AT2 cells and hepatocytes were identified., Methods: The specific binding of biotinylated spike and spike 1 proteins to undifferentiated human E12 MLPC (E12), E12 differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and E12 human hepatocyte-like hybrid cells (HLC) was studied by confocal microscopy. We investigated the expression of ACE-2, binding of biotinylated spike protein, biotinylated spike 1 and inhibition of binding by unlabeled spike protein, two neutralizing antibodies and an antibody directed against the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGr1)., Results: E12 MLPC did not express ACE-2 and did not bind either of spike or spike 1 proteins. AT2-like cells expressed ACE-2 and bound both spike and spike 1. Both PHH and HLC did not express ACE-2 and did not bind spike 1 protein. However, both PHH and HLC actively bound the spike protein. Biotinylated spike protein binding was inhibited by unlabeled spike but not spike 1 protein on PHH and HLC. Two commercial neutralizing antibodies blocked the binding of the spike to PHH and HLC but only one blocked binding to AT2. An antibody to the hepatocyte ASGr1 blocked the binding of the spike protein to PHH and HLC., Conclusion: The absence of ACE-2 receptors and inhibition of spike binding by an antibody to the ASGr1 on both PHH and HLC suggested that the spike protein interacts with the ASGr1. The differential antibody blocking of spike binding to AT2, PHH and HLC indicated that neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 binding might involve additional mechanisms beyond RBD binding to ACE-2.

Depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study.,"Alyami, Hamad S; Naser, Abdallah Y; Zmaily Dahmash, Eman; Alyami, Mohammed H; Alyami, Musfer S","AIMS: The emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, with a high transmission and mortality rate, has created an extraordinary crisis worldwide. Such an unusual situation may have an undesirable impact on the mental health of individuals which, in turn, may influence their outcomes. This study aimed to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological disposition of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia., METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27 March and 27 April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of these., RESULTS: A total of 2,081 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, individuals aged 50 years and above, divorced people, retired people, university students, and those with an income between 2,000 and 10,000 SR were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married people, the unemployed, and those with a high income (> 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety., CONCLUSION: We found that there is a wide range of Saudi residents who are at higher risk of developing mental illness during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences during this pandemic and provide the required health support.

Clinical Profiles and Mortality of COVID-19 Inpatients with Parkinson's Disease in Germany.,"Scherbaum, Raphael; Kwon, Eun Hae; Richter, Daniel; Bartig, Dirk; Gold, Ralf; Krogias, Christos; Tonges, Lars","BACKGROUND: Comprehensive, nationwide data regarding Parkinson's disease (PD) hospitalizations, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in-hospital frequency, and COVID-19-associated inpatient mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic are not available., OBJECTIVE: To provide a nationwide analysis on hospitalized PD patients in Germany and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an administrative claims database covering 1468 hospitals and 5,210,432 patient hospitalizations including a total of 30,872 COVID-19+ cases between January 16 and May 15, 2020., RESULTS: Compared to 2019, hospitalizations for PD transiently decreased by up to 72.7% in 2020. COVID-19 frequency was significantly higher in the population of 64,434 PD patients (693 being COVID-19+ ) than in non-PD patients (1.1% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001), especially in subjects with advanced age (>= 65 years). Regarding established COVID-19 risk comorbidities, COVID-19+ inpatients with PD showed higher incidences than non-PD COVID-19+ subjects, particularly hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Advanced age and male sex were significantly more frequent in COVID-19+ than in COVID-19- PD patients. The COVID-19 inpatient mortality rate was much higher in PD patients than in non-PD patients (35.4% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.001), especially in patients aged 75-79 years. Of note, overall inpatient mortality of PD patients was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (5.7% vs. 4.9%, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: PD inpatients are more frequently affected by COVID-19 and suffer from increased COVID-19-associated mortality in comparison to non-PD patients. More comprehensive studies are needed to assess the significance of associated comorbidities for COVID-19 risk and mortality in PD. Â© 2021 The Authors.

Protein-nanoparticle interactions and a new insight.,"Ghosh, Goutam; Panicker, Lata","The study of protein-nanoparticle interactions provides knowledge about the bio-reactivity of nanoparticles, and creates a database of nanoparticles for applications in nanomedicine, nanodiagnosis, and nanotherapy. The problem arises when nanoparticles come in contact with physiological fluids such as plasma or serum, wherein they interact with the proteins (or other biomolecules). This interaction leads to the coating of proteins on the nanoparticle surface, mostly due to the electrostatic interaction, called 'corona'. These proteins are usually partially unfolded. The protein corona can deter nanoparticles from their targeted functionalities, such as drug/DNA delivery at the site and fluorescence tagging of diseased tissues. The protein corona also has many repercussions on cellular intake, inflammation, accumulation, degradation, and clearance of the nanoparticles from the body depending on the exposed part of the proteins. Hence, the protein-nanoparticle interaction and the configuration of the bound-proteins on the nanosurface need thorough investigation and understanding. Several techniques such as DLS and zeta potential measurement, UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, FTIR, and DSC provide valuable information in the protein-nanoparticle interaction study. Besides, theoretical simulations also provide additional understanding. Despite a lot of research publications, the fundamental question remained unresolved. Can we aim for the application of functional nanoparticles in medicine? A new insight, given by us, in this article assumes a reasonable solution to this crucial question.",2021,/,Soft matter,17,14,3855-3875,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0sm02050h,33885450,#101376,Ghosh 2021,,,0,0.781322213

Predisposing risk factors for COVID-19 infection: A case-control study,"Shahbazi, Fatemeh; Solgi, Manoochehr; Khazaei, Salman ","Background: The Covid-19 epidemic in 2019 has created many public health problems. Literature that focuses on the risk factors of this issue is limited especially in developing countries. This study proposed to examine the risk factors of COVID-19 infection in the west area of Iran. Method(s): This case-control study was conducted from February to April 2020 in Nahavand county, western Iran. Cases were all patients who were coronavirus positive and, the controls included people who had clinical signs consistent with COVID-19, but their test results were negative. Two controls were selected for every case. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of epidemiological aspects on the incidence of COVID-19. Result(s): Significant risk factors for COVID-19 infection based on the multivariable logistic regression model were male gender (OR=1.82, P=0.0.15), age group over 60 years (OR=2.04, P=0.017), living in urban areas (OR=1.79, P=0.018), being married (OR=2.08, P=0.022), having history of contact with the corona patients (OR=5.61, P=0.009), and comorbidities (OR=1.78, P=0.031). Conclusion(s): This study highlighted the factors associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 infection.

Relevance of carotid bodies in COVID-19: A hypothetical viewpoint.,"Machado, Benedito H; Paton, Julian F R","We have considered some of the available evidence to account for the impact of SARS-CoV on the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous and respiratory systems. Apart from stimulating general interest in the subject, our hope was to provide putative explanations for some of the patients' symptoms based on described physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms seen in other diseases. Herein, we have focused on the carotid bodies. In this hypothetical viewpoint, we have discussed the plasticity of the carotid body chemoreflex and made a comparison between acute and chronic exposures to high altitude with COVID-19. From these discussions, we have postulated that the sensitivity of the hypoxic ventilatory response may well determine the outcome of disease severity and those that live at high altitude may be more resistant. We have provided insight into silent hypoxia and attempted to explain an absence of ventilatory drive and anxiety yet maintenance of consciousness. In an attempt to discover more about the mysteries of COVID-19, we conclude with questions and some hypothetical studies that may answer them. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Modified full-face snorkeling mask for thoracic surgery and otolaryngology surgical use: comfort and usability assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Cacco, Tommaso; Fragale, Marco; Sampieri, Claudio; Castello, Eolo; Risso, Carlo; Piras, Maria Teresa; Durando, Paolo; Montecucco, Alfredo; Pariscenti, Gian Luca; Peretti, Giorgio","BACKGROUND: A worldwide personal protection equipment (PPE) shortage has emerged during COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health care providers. To address this lack of PEE, new solutions have been researched. Among those, full-face snorkeling masks demonstrated to be an interesting option. Among surgical specialties otolaryngologists and thoracic surgeons are at high risk of infection, due to the close contact with airway secretions., OBJECTIVES: We tested the comfort and usability of a modified full-face snorkeling mask (Ocean Reef Mask Aria QR+) as a protective device for otolaryngologic and thoracic surgeries., METHODS: The mask was customized with a 3D-printed adaptor supporting many industrial filter types, including FFP3 and heat and moisture ex- changers (HME). We evaluated surgical performances of the mask, both subjectively, with a questionnaire filled in by the surgeons, as well as objectively, monitoring transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2 values of surgeons during surgical procedures., RESULTS: The modified full-face snorkeling mask was tested during 9 otolaryngologic and 15 thoracic surgery procedures. The device demonstrated very good overall vision quality with some limitations regarding lateral vision and almost no difficulties in usability. Water condensation into the mask was absent in almost every case. Both PO2 and PCO2 param- eters remained within normal ranges during every procedure., DISCUSSION: The modified full-face snorkeling mask can be an innovative PPE.

Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols.,"Chen, Paul Z; Bobrovitz, Niklas; Premji, Zahra; Koopmans, Marion; Fisman, David N; Gu, Frank X","Background: Which virological factors mediate overdispersion in the transmissibility of emerging viruses remains a longstanding question in infectious disease epidemiology., Methods: Here, we use systematic review to develop a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We then comparatively meta-analyze the data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus via respiratory droplets and aerosols., Results: The analyses indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing. Coughing increases the contagiousness, especially in close contact, of symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Infectiousness tends to be elevated between 1-5 days post-symptom onset., Conclusions: Intrinsic case variation in rVL facilitates overdispersion in the transmissibility of emerging respiratory viruses. Our findings present considerations for disease control in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future outbreaks of novel viruses., Funding: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant program, NSERC Senior Industrial Research Chair program and the Toronto COVID-19 Action Fund.

"Does the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic impact on oral hygiene habits, oral conditions, reasons to seek dental care and esthetic concerns?.","Pinzan-Vercelino, Celia-Regina-Maio; Freitas, Karina-Maria-Salvatore; Girao, Valquiria-Mendes-Pereira; da Silva, Daniella-de Oliveira; Peloso, Renan-Morais; Pinzan, Arnaldo","Background: To evaluate the impact of the use of face masks on oral hygiene habits; oral conditions self-perception; reasons to seek dental treatment; and esthetic concerns., Material and Methods: 1346 participants answered a web-based survey with questions related to the aims of the study. Descriptive statistic was performed and the responses were analyzed with chi-square test and regression analysis., Results: With the use of masks, toothbrushing frequency decreased significantly, and people are significantly less concerned about oral hygiene. The number of subjects that reported to have halitosis increased significantly and this was associated with a decrease in toothbrushing frequency. The greatest complaints of subjects were teeth color and alignment. The prevalence of bruxism increased significantly. Overall, 94.1% considered that esthetics is important to seek dental care even with the use of masks, and 84.2% are maintaining usual periodic dental care. People are significantly less concerned with their smile and dental esthetics with the use of masks., Conclusions: With the use of face mask, people must be motivated regarding maintaining oral hygiene habits. Some respondents will seek dental care only when masks were no longer necessary, therefore dentists must be aware of a reduction in the volume of patients.

Stroke Care in the United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Douiri, Abdel; Muruet, Walter; Bhalla, Ajay; James, Martin; Paley, Lizz; Stanley, Kaili; Rudd, Anthony G; Wolfe, Charles D A; Bray, Benjamin D; SSNAP Collaboration","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has potentially caused indirect harm to patients with other conditions via reduced access to health care services. We aimed to describe the impact of the initial wave of the pandemic on admissions, care quality, and outcomes in patients with acute stroke in the United Kingdom., METHODS: Registry-based cohort study of patients with acute stroke admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and equivalent periods in the 3 prior years., RESULTS: One hundred fourteen hospitals provided data for a study cohort of 184 017 patients. During the lockdown period (March 23 to April 30), there was a 12% reduction (6923 versus 7902) in the number of admissions compared with the same period in the 3 previous years. Admissions fell more for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke, for older patients, and for patients with less severe strokes. Quality of care was preserved for all measures and in some domains improved during lockdown (direct access to stroke unit care, 1-hour brain imaging, and swallow screening). Although there was no change in the proportion of patients discharged with good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, <=2; 48% versus 48%), 7-day inpatient case fatality increased from 6.9% to 9.4% (P<0.001) and was 22.0% in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.41 [1.11-1.80])., CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the true incidence of acute stroke did not change markedly during the pandemic, hospital avoidance may have created a cohort of untreated stroke patients at risk of poorer outcomes or recurrent events. Unanticipated improvements in stroke care quality should be used as an opportunity for quality improvement and to learn about how to develop resilient health care systems.",2021,/,Stroke,,"v2j, 0235266",STROKEAHA120032253,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.032253,33896223,#103457,Douiri 2021,,,0,0.262227629
Diagnostic methods and drug therapies in patients with ischemic colitis,"Xiong, LiNa; Jiang, Xin; Xu, YuShuang; Li, YaNan; Xiong, ZhiFan ","Purpose: Ischemic colitis (IC) is the most prevalent ischemic injury of thegastrointestinal tract. Clinical features of IC such as acute abdominal pain, hematochezia,and diarrhea are similar to those of acute mesenteric ischemia, inflammatorybowel disease, or infectious bowel disease, and their relative ambiguity candelay diagnosis and treatment. To comprehensively detail the current state ofdiagnostic methods and available drug therapies for detecting and treating IC,this review aims to provide a concise and practical summary of thecorresponding literature. Method(s): PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched toretrieve all published studies reporting the diagnostic methods and drugtherapies in patients with ischemic colitis. The search strategy of drugtherapy includes human and animal data. Result(s): Colonoscopy combined with histopathologicalbiopsy is the standard of diagnosis for the IC. Most patients respond well tothe conservative treatment, and surgical consultation is needed when conservativetreatment is ineffective. Studies of potential drug therapy have beendeveloped, including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, pentoxifylline,rebamipide, prostaglandin E1, and polydeoxyribonucleotide. Conclusion(s): Accurate diagnoses and effective treatmentshave helped reduce the mortality rate and improve prognoses for patientsafflicted with IC, and corresponding drug therapies have been constantlyupdated as new research has emerged.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,/,International Journal of Colorectal Disease,36,1,47-56,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00384-020-03739-z,2006171076,#101837,Xiong 2021,,,0,0.214256882
Oral manifestations of COVID-19 patients: An online survey of the Egyptian population.,"El Kady, Dina M; Gomaa, Esraa Ahmad; Abdella, Walid Shaban; Ashraf Hussien, Reham; Abd ElAziz, Rawda H; Khater, Ahmad G A","OBJECTIVES: This pilot survey aims to study the oral manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and report the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 15 to June 10, 2020, we used an online questionnaire containing the oral manifestations that are expected to be associated with the COVID-19 infection. Adults in our survey who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 positive were confirmed with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and isolated in various hospitals in Cairo, Egypt., RESULTS: This pilot study included 58 (53.4% males and 46.6% females) COVID-19 patients ages 18-46 years, and 13 (22.4%) were healthcare workers. Our results showed that 67.2% of the patients had at least one manifestation related to the oral cavity and salivary glands, and 32.8% (n = 19) did not have any symptoms associated with the oral cavity. The highest prevalence symptoms were dry mouth 39.7% (n = 23), gustatory dysfunction as 34.5% (n = 20) loss of salt sensation, 29.3% (n = 17) loss of sweet sensation, and 25.9% (n = 15) altered food taste, while the least prevalent symptoms were tongue redness 8.8% (n = 5), and gingival bleeding 7% (n = 4). The most frequently associated symptoms were loss of salt and sweetness, as reported by 27.6% of the participants. However, there was no significant association between the incidence of oral symptoms and demographic data (age, gender, or job) of the patients (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited data, COVID-19 significantly impacts the oral cavity and salivary glands, as salivary gland-related symptoms and taste disorders are highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients.

"Proactive Teleconsultation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases Identified Through the Community-Testing Initiative in Karachi, Pakistan: A Low-Cost Value-Added Service to Support a Pandemic Response in a Resource-Limited Setting.","Moosa, Shazia; Shah, Sabeen; Mohiuddin, Amal Fatima; Haider, Kaniz Farwa; Khowaja, Saira","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) struck Pakistan with a magnitude that required micro- and macro-level adjustments at national and provincial levels. Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion:  The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted.

Lipid homeostasis and mevalonate pathway in COVID-19: Basic concepts and potential therapeutic targets.,"Proto, Maria Chiara; Fiore, Donatella; Piscopo, Chiara; Pagano, Cristina; Galgani, Mario; Bruzzaniti, Sara; Laezza, Chiara; Gazzerro, Patrizia; Bifulco, Maurizio","Despite encouraging progresses achieved in the management of viral diseases, efficient strategies to counteract infections are still required. The current global challenge highlighted the need to develop a rapid and cost-effective strategy to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in viral infections. Viruses can use the host lipid machinery to support their life cycle and to impair the host immune response. The altered expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes, induced by several viruses, assures survival and spread in host tissue. In some infections, statins, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, reduce cholesterol in the plasma membrane of permissive cells resulting in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus. Statins can also counteract viral infections through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Beyond statins, interfering with the mevalonate pathway could have an adjuvant effect in therapies aimed at mitigating endothelial dysfunction and deregulated inflammation in viral infection. In this review we depicted the historical and current evidence highlighting how lipid homeostasis and mevalonate pathway targeting represents a valid approach to rapidly neutralize viruses, focusing our attention to their potential use as effective targets to hinder SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. Pros and cons of statins and Mevalonate-pathway inhibitors have been also dissected. Copyright Â© 2018.

"COVID-19 Outbreak Among Farmworkers - Okanogan County, Washington, May-August 2020.","Miller, James S; Holshue, Michelle; Dostal, Tia K H; Newman, Laura P; Lindquist, Scott","Okanogan County, Washington, experienced increased community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during summer 2020 (1). Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in agricultural settings, including a large outbreak among employees of a fruit grower during May-August. Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles. Positive test results were received by 28% of employees who worked packing and sorting fruit, 24% of those in other roles in the packing and sorting area, 10% of forklift operators, 7% of employees in other warehouse roles, and 6% of office employees. Point prevalence among all warehouse workers was 1% at the screening testing event. Collaboration among employers, community groups, and public health authorities can reveal risk factors and help decrease farmworkers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community and the workplace.

The Influence of Post-Traumatic Growth on College Students' Creativity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of General Self-Efficacy and the Moderating Role of Deliberate Rumination.,"Zeng, Wei; Zeng, Yuqing; Xu, Yanhua; Huang, Dongtao; Shao, Jinlian; Wu, Jiamin; Wu, Xingrou","Purpose: This study used a moderated mediation model to test the mediating effect of general self-efficacy on the relationship between post-traumatic growth (PTG) and creativity and the moderating effect of deliberate rumination in the second path of the indirect mediation path during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A sample of 881 university students from Guangdong Province, China, was surveyed with the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Deliberate Rumination Inventory. SPSS (23 version) and PROCESS (3.3 version) were used for correlation analyses, mediation analysis, and moderated mediation analysis. Results: (1) PTG was positively correlated with creativity, self-efficacy, and deliberate rumination. Creativity was positively correlated with self-efficacy and deliberate rumination. Deliberate rumination was positively correlated with self-efficacy. (2) Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between PTG and creativity. (3) Deliberate rumination moderated the second half of the path of ""PTG -> self-efficacy -> creativity."" Conclusions: PTG affected creativity directly and also indirectly through self-efficacy. In particular, deliberate rumination moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and creativity, such that the association was stronger when the incidence of deliberate rumination was low. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the positive link between PTG and creativity.

Pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19: a narrative review.,"Tanni, Suzana Erico; Fabro, Alexandre Todorovic; de Albuquerque, Andre; Ferreira, Eloara Vieira Machado; Verrastro, Carlos Gustavo Yuji; Sawamura, Marcio Valente Yamada; Ribeiro, Sergio Marrone; Baldi, Bruno Guedes","Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing worldwide, and as a result, the number of patients with pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 will expand over time. Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues. Areas covered: This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease.

[Therapeutic drug plans: how many and which ones? Overview of a prescriptive and care appropriateness tool.].,"Piccinni, Carlo; Addesi, Alice; Pedrini, Antonella; Esposito, Immacolata; Rampazzo, Roberta; Mezzalira, Luigi; Trentin, Luca; Font, Maria; Trotta, Francesco; Pierantozzi, Andrea; Di Filippo, Aurora; Altamura, Gianluca; Da Cas, Roberto; Martini, Nello","Therapeutic plans (TPs) were introduced in Italy in 2004 in order to ensure the continuity in the prescription of new drugs between specialist physicians and general practitioners (GPs). Over the years this prescription tool was updated several times: starting from a paper form without any template (""paper TP"") to a template defined by AIFA to collect specific clinical information, up to a web-based form to collect all information into a database. Over time-critical issues concerning its usefulness have been raised, especially when AIFA established several extensions for TP validity to ensure the social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, after several years from their establishment, pending adoption of necessary implementing of Ministerial Decree of 25th March 2020, a check of the actual impact of TPs is required, in order to plan their review. This study provide a detailed overview of all TPs active in Italy at the 11th May 2020. From Farmadati database, all drugs reimbursed by the National Health Service (class A drugs) and requiring TP were selected. The consumption of these drugs has been derived from OsMed Reports that make available data of medicines consumption and expenditure in the general population in Italy. The analysis showed that TP is required for the prescription of 935 medicinal products (9.6% of class-A drugs) and 147 different active substances (belonging to 34 different Therapeutic Groups and 66 subgroups). Out of these, 67 (46%) required a paper TP without any template, 72 (49%) a paper TP on AIFA template, and 8 (5%) a web-based TP. The Therapeutic Group with the largest number of active ingredients with TP were antidiabetics (19.7%), followed by immunomodulating and immunosuppressants (9.5%) and medications for asthma and COPD (6.8%). Consumption analysis of drugs with TP showed that this prescription tool covers 943,899,598 DDD per year, equal to 2,586,026 DDD/day. This means that TPs have a very high impact in terms of the prevalence of patients treated on the entire care process. Of all annual DDDs prescribed on TP, 46.8% concerned drugs with TP on template AIFA, 34.5% drugs with web-based TP, while the remaining 18.7% drugs with paper TP without a template. This analysis may provide the basis for an analytical case-by-case review of TP maintenance needs, trying to maximize the benefits of this tool and to reduce its possible adverse effects. This review could be helpful to ensure the appropriateness in the drug uses, to enhance the role of general medicine, and to simplify the pathways of millions of patients ensuring the continuity of their care.",2021,/,Recenti progressi in medicina,112,4,243-249,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1701/3584.35683,33877085,#101326,Piccinni 2021,,,0,0.158886897
Role of Cigarette Smoke on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 Protein Membrane Expression in Bronchial Epithelial Cells Using an Air-Liquid Interface Model.,"Caruso, Massimo; Distefano, Alfio; Emma, Rosalia; Di Rosa, Michelino; Carota, Giuseppe; Rust, Sonja; Polosa, Riccardo; Zuccarello, Pietro; Ferrante, Margherita; Raciti, Giuseppina; Li Volti, Giovanni","Prevalence studies of current smoking, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, demonstrated an unexpectedly low prevalence among patients with COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of smoke from cigarettes on ACE-2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Normal bronchial epithelial cells (H292) were exposed to smoke by an air-liquid-interface (ALI) system and ACE-2 membrane protein expression was evaluated after 24 h from exposure. Our transcriptomics data analysis showed a significant selective reduction of membrane ACE-2 expression (about 25%) following smoking exposure. Interestingly, we observed a positive direct correlation between ACE-2 reduction and nicotine delivery. Furthermore, by stratifying GSE52237 as a function of ACE-2 gene expression levels, we highlighted 1,012 genes related to ACE-2 in smokers and 855 in non-smokers. Furthermore, we showed that 161 genes involved in the endocytosis process were highlighted using the online pathway tool KEGG. Finally, 11 genes were in common between the ACE-2 pathway in smokers and the genes regulated during endocytosis, while 12 genes with non-smokers. Interestingly, six in non-smokers and four genes in smokers were closely involved during the viral internalization process.

Despite the mounting evidence, little data exists on rates and predictors of VTE in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals compared to negative patients with similar symptoms. METHOD(S): Retrospective chart review of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals presenting to an Academic Medical Center in Baton Rouge, LA between 3/3/2020 and 5/13/2020. Patients were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and received a complex duplex ultrasound during the same admission. Positive SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients received thromboprophylaxis per hospital guidelines. We compared baseline demographics, laboratory data, outcomes, and mortality between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients utilizing Mann-Whitney U and Chi-Square tests. Logistic regression was used to identify predictive factors for DVT. RESULT(S): A total of 92 patients were included, of which 51 were positive for COVID (55%). 35 patients (38%) had an ultrasound confirmed DVT. Patients in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group had more severe illness on presentation (evidenced by higher Charlson scores (p<0.005) and APACHE-II scores (p<0.001)). There were no significant differences in other typical VTE risk factors including age, BMI, smoking history, or diabetes. Rates of DVT were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (51%) compared to negative (22%, p<0.01). Logistic Regression showed that in addition to well known risk factors (mechanical ventilation, surgery during admission), a positive SARS-CoV-2 result placed hospitalized patients at elevated risk of developing DVT (X2 (1,4)=32.39, p<0.001). While not statistically significant in our population, there was a higher rate of mortality in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with DVT (38.5%) compared to those without DVT (24%, p=0.368). CONCLUSION(S): Even with less severe illness on presentation, thromboprophylaxis, and no difference in typical risk factors, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were more likely to develop DVT compared to negative patients with similar symptoms.

Severity of the disease may be associated with several factors. Here, we review clinical features of COVID-19 inpatients with different severities. This cross-sectional study was performed in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during February-April 2020. COVID-19 patients with typical computed tomography (CT) patterns and/or positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. The patients were classified into three groups of moderate, severe, and critical based on disease severity. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were collected and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 200 patients with mean age of 69.75 +/- 6.39 years, of whom 82 (41%) were female were studied. Disease was severe/critical in the majority of patients (167, 83.5%). Disease severity was significantly associated with age, malignant comorbidities, dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, confusion, respiratory rate, pulse rate, O2 saturation, extent of CT involvement, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), pH, pO2, and aspartate transaminase (P < 0.05). Moreover, complications including shock, coagulopathy, acidosis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and intubation were significantly higher in patients with higher severities (P < 0.05).

Method(s): We performed a retrospective chart review of children up to 18 years who underwent testing for SARS CoV-2 from March 1st to May 10th 2020 at our pediatric emergency department. We abstracted patient's demographics, clinical presentation, diagnostic studies and patient disposition. We classified the severity of clinical illness based on published criteria. We excluded patients diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Result(s): SARS CoV-2 testing was performed on 481 patients of whom 43 (8.9%) tested positive. Of these, 4 were diagnosed with MIS-C. Data of 39 patients were analyzed. Patients' demographics, co-morbidities, presenting signs and symptoms and disposition are shown in Table 1. Age range was 47 days - 18 years. Infants representing one third (14/39; 35.9%) of our study cohort. There was equal sex distribution. Asthma or obesity was present in 17 (44%). The most common presenting symptoms included fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Chest radiograph showed pneumonia in 12 (30.8%) patients. Two thirds (27/39; 69.2%) were asymptomatic or had mild disease; six patients (15.4%) had severe or critical illness (Figure 1). Nineteen (48%) patients were admitted to the general pediatric service. Eleven (28%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICU). The characteristics, presenting symptoms and interventions performed in the PICU cohort are shown in Table 2. Half of these patients required mechanical ventilation. There was one death in a 3 month old infant unrelated to SARS CoV-2. Majority of the infants required hospitalization (12/14; 85.7%), including 4 to the PICU (one each for non accidental trauma, ingestion, seizure and pneumonia). Conclusion(s): Majority (17; 43%) of our children with COVID-19 had a mild disease. Eleven (28%) including 4 infants required critical care; 5 required mechanical ventilation. There was no COVID-19 related mortality. Larger studies are needed to further define the spectrum of COVID- 19 and risk factors associated with severe disease in children.

Cpg-adjuvanted hepatitis b vaccination improves seroprotection rates in veterans with hiv,"Deming, Meagan; Kottilil, Shyam; Wilson, Eleanor ","Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global health issue, leading to complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Individuals co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and HBV have increased liver- related morbidity and mortality compared to those with HBV mono-infection. Vaccination can effectively prevent HBV infection, but certain critical populations including people living with HIV (PLWH) are less likely to achieve seroprotection (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) titer >= 10 IU/mL) after vaccination; seroprotection rates (SPR) in PLWH range from 34 to 88% in clinical trials, with improved SPR in those with immunologic reconstitution and viral suppression. With improved immunologic status, SPR have dramatically improved in our Veteran Infectious Disease clinic population. However, a subset of patients remain HBV vaccine nonresponders despite re-vaccination attempts, perhaps due to intrinsic immunologic anergy. We hypothesized that Veterans with HIV who were nonresponders to prior HBV vaccines may respond to a more immunogenic vaccine. Heplisav-B is a 2-dose series, with improved SPR in other classically difficult to vaccinate groups (including the elderly and those with diabetes), but has not yet been studied in individuals with HIV. Methods. HBV vaccine nonresponders who had previously been vaccinated and boosted with median 3 and up to 8 doses of alum-adjuvanted HBV vaccines were re-vaccinated with Heplisav-B. HBsAb titers were assessed at days 0, 30, and 60 to follow vaccine responses. Results. Participants had a median age of 65 (range 44 to 83) and were virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Enrollment and vaccination was interrupted by the COVID-10 pandemic, but 8 of 10 (80%) enrolled participants had seroprotective titers at day 60, with 6 having titers > 1000 IU/mL. Of the 8 additional participants who had available serologies after the first dose, all were seroprotected, and 3 had titers > 1000 IU/mL.16 of 18 (89%) participants achieved seroprotection with Heplisav-B. Conclusion. Heplisav-B is immunogenic in persons with HIV and should be a reasonable option for HBV vaccination of PLWH who are previous nonresponders.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S558,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.1244,634731557,#98889,Deming 2020,,,0,0.069247225
Learning During Crisis: The Impact of COVID-19 on Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injury Incidence.,"Polancich, Shea; Hall, Allyson G; Miltner, Rebecca; Poe, Terri; Enogela, Ene M; Montgomery, Aoyjai P; Patrician, Patricia A","ABSTRACT: The impact of COVID-19, on the health and safety of patients, staff, and healthcare organizations, has yet to be fully uncovered. Patient adverse events, such as hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs), have been problematic for decades. The introduction of a pandemic to an environment that is potentially at-risk for adverse events may result in unintended patient safety and quality concerns. We use the learning health system framework to motivate our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of HAPIs within our health system. Using a retrospective, observational design, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate trends in HAPI from March to July 2020. Hospital-acquired pressure injury numbers have fluctuated from a steady increase from March-May 2020, hitting a peak high of 90 cases in the month of May. However, the trend in the total all stage HAPIs began to decline in June 2020, with a low of 51 in July, the lowest number since March 2020. Patients evaluated in this study did not have a longitudinal increase in HAPIs from March-July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite similarities in illness severity between the two time points. Our experience has demonstrated the ability of our organizational leaders to learn quickly during crisis.

The Importance of determining SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag serodiagnostics for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia in hospital settings,"Lebedin, Yuri S.; Panteleeva, A.V.; Lyang, O.V.; Galstyan, A.G.; Belousov, V.V.; Rebrikov, D.V. ","A new coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which appeared in December 2019, has claimed the lives of 2.5 million people in almost a year. The high contagiousness of this virus has led to its wide and rapid spread around the world. As of February 2021, the total number of cases is 111 million people; more than 4 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been registered in the Russian Federation. To successfully combat the emerging pandemic, it is necessary to quickly diagnose the disease at an early stage, which will prevent the further spread of this virus and prescribe the necessary treatment on time. The aim of the work was to evaluate the use of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) and respective antibodies as diagnostic markers in pneumonia patients. The study was conducted at the height of COVID-19 pandemic in Moscow, Russia. It included 425 emergency patients with clinical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia, of which 280 (66%) were positive for either serum N-Ag and/or its respective antibodies. We demonstrate the total prevalence of N-Ag seroconversion in SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia patients within 3-5 days after hospital admission. The results indicate high feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnostics in emergency patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University.

Modified PRIEST score for identification of very low-risk COVID patients.,"Suh, Edward H; Lang, Kendrick J; Zerihun, Lillian M","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 transmission remains high around the world, and severe local outbreaks continue to occur. Prognostic tools may be useful in crisis conditions as risk stratification can help determine resource allocation. One published tool, the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage Severity Score, seems particularly promising because of its predictive ability and ease of application at the bedside. We sought to understand the performance of a modified version of this score (mPRIEST) in our institution for identifying patients with a greater than minimal risk for adverse outcome (death or organ support) at 30 days after index visit., METHODS: Consecutive visits at two northern Manhattan EDs with a new diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 were identified between November and December of 2020. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were obtained from chart review. Outcomes were obtained from chart review and follow-up phone call., RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 306 patients. The incidence of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 days for patients in patients with mPRIEST above the threshold value was 43/181 (23.8%), and for patients below 1/125 (0.8%). The sensitivity of the score for adverse outcome was 97.7% (95% CI: 93.3% to 100%)., CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests the mPRIEST score, which can be calculated from clinical variables alone, has potential for use in EDs to identify patients at very low risk for adverse outcomes within 30 days of COVID diagnosis. This should be confirmed in larger formal validation studies in diverse settings. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia published data came from hospitalised patients. This study set out to describe clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed in primary care across age groups and type of pneumonia., METHODS: Observational retrospective study obtaining clinical data from the electronic health records of patients who were followed-up by SARS-CoV-2 possible infection in a primary care practice in Madrid. All the cases were collected by in-person or remote consultation during the 10th March to the 7th of April., EXPOSURE: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by chest X-ray ordered by the GP. Main outcomes and measures: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, physical examination and diagnostic tests as a blood test, nasopharyngeal swab results for RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and chest X-ray results., RESULTS: The overall SARS-CoV-2 pneumonias collected were 172 (female 87 [50.6%], mean age 60.5 years standard deviation [SD] 17.0). Comorbidities were body mass index >= 25 kg/m2 (90 [52.3%]), hypertension (83 [48.3%]), dyslipidaemia (68 [39.5%]) and diabetes (33 [19.2%]). The sample was stratified by age groups (< 50 years, 50-75 years and >= 75 years).

Climate change during the COVID-19 outbreak: scoping future perspectives.,"Usman, Muhammad; Husnain, Mudassir; Riaz, Aimon; Riaz, Areej; Ali, Yameen","Neither war nor recession or any kind of prior disaster has been considered a prelude to the looming threat of climate change over the past era as coronavirus (hereafter COVID-19) has in only a few months. Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO2 emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution.

One approach to rapid testing is to leverage the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detection dogs, a biological sensor of VOCs, were utilized to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 positive urine and saliva patient samples had a unique odor signature. The virus was inactivated in all training samples with either detergent or heat treatment. Using detergent-inactivated urine samples, dogs were initially trained to find samples collected from hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ignoring samples collected from controls. Dogs were then tested on their ability to spontaneously recognize heat-treated urine samples as well as heat-treated saliva from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Dogs successfully discriminated between infected and uninfected urine samples, regardless of the inactivation protocol, as well as heat-treated saliva samples. Generalization to novel samples was limited, particularly after intensive training with a restricted sample set. A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening, either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods. The use of dogs for screening in an operational setting will require training with a large number of novel SARS-CoV-2 positive and confirmed negative samples.",2021,/,PloS one,16,4,e0250158,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250158,33852639,#97951,Essler 2021,,,0,0.082682986

Incidence of Sino-Nasal Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients.,"Meenakshi, M; Raj, K Deepak; Nandhini, R","Corona virus disease was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is spreading across the world in an alarming fashion. To contain the spread, it is very important to identify the subtle/not readily apparent symptoms of COVID-19 at the earliest. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence duration progress of sino-nasal symptoms in COV 2 positive patients using SNAQ scoring. Patients who tested positive for SARS-COV 2 by RT-PCR and admitted in our hospital under category A (n = 382) were included in the study. A detailed history was collected from all the patients and sino-nasal assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) was provided to the patient with complaints of sinonasal symptoms and they were asked to fill the forms on day 3, 7 and 14. To identify the characteristics of sinonasal symptoms in COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking, smoking history was also collected in detail and patients were classified based on Brinkman's index into mild, moderate and severe smokers. In this study, the incidence of sinonasal symptoms was 24%. Average SNAQ scoring on day 3 was 30.09 and on day 7 was 12.9 and day 14 is 3.8. There was a decline in score on day 7 compared to day 3 indicating symptoms decrease by day7. Average SNAQ scoring in non-smokers and mild and moderate smokers was 20.18, 34.11, 57.5 respectively. The SNAQ scoring in smokers was more than that of non-smokers and was also persistent for a longer duration compared to non-smokers. Sino-nasal symptoms catch our eye because it is an important route for transmission. Viral shedding from sinonasal tract may be an important source for transmission. History and degree of smoking should also be considered while dividing COVID-19 patients into categories.

Methods: The scales of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in 782 COVID-19 patients during the first month of centralized quarantine (March 16 to 26, 2020) and then during home isolation (April 3 to 10, 2020). Results: During the centralized quarantine, the prevalence rates of insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were 44.37, 31.59, and 27.62%, respectively, and those during the home isolation decreased significantly at 27.11, 17.26, and 16.11%, respectively. In both waves, women showed a higher prevalence of symptoms of poor mental health compared to men, and middle-aged (40-59 years old) and elderly (>=60 years old) showed a higher risk of symptoms of poor mental health compared to the younger. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 revealed no significant relationship to symptoms of poor mental health, whereas, the interaction analysis revealed that those with other underlying diseases showed more symptoms of poor mental health during the centralized quarantine and a greater decrease during the follow-up home isolation. Conclusion:  The discharged COVID-19 patients suffered from mental health problems such as, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and this was especially so for women, the middle-aged and elderly, and those with underlying diseases, but along with the rehabilitation and the environmental change from centralized quarantine to home isolation, all the mental symptoms were significantly alleviated. Based on a follow-up investigation, the current results provide critical evidence for mental health and early rehabilitation upon the discharged COVID-19 patients.

Dyslipidemia in breast cancer patients increases the risk of SAR-CoV-2 infection.,"Shakartalla, Sarra B; Alhumaidi, Razan B; Shammout, Ola D A; Al Shareef, Zainab M; Ashmawy, Naglaa S; Soliman, Sameh S M","Breast cancer (BC) is the most diagnosed and second leading cause of death among women worldwide. Elevated levels of lipids have been reported in BC patients. On the other hand, lipids play an important role in coronavirus infections including the newly emerged disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated COVID-19 by WHO. Cancer patients including BC have been reported to be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is mostly attributed to the chronic immunosuppressive status of cancer patients along with the use of cytotoxic drugs. Here in this review, we highlighted the role of dyslipidemia associated with BC patients in the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated levels of lipids namely phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and eicosanoids in the serum of BC patients and their re-localization to the alveolar spaces can increase susceptibility and/or severity due to SARA-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, manipulation of dyslipidemia in BC patients should be recommended as prophylactic and therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright Â© 2021.

From Multiplex Serology to Serolomics-A Novel Approach to the Antibody Response against the SARS-CoV-2 Proteome.,"Butt, Julia; Murugan, Rajagopal; Hippchen, Theresa; Olberg, Sylvia; van Straaten, Monique; Wardemann, Hedda; Stebbins, Erec; Krausslich, Hans-Georg; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Brenner, Hermann; Laketa, Vibor; Schottker, Ben; Muller, Barbara; Merle, Uta; Waterboer, Tim","The emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entails an urgent need for specific and sensitive high-throughput serological assays to assess SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We, therefore, aimed at developing a fluorescent-bead based SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay for detection of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a COVID-19 case cohort (n = 48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n = 85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. A sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86-100%) was achieved in COVID-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96-100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response. This newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity to determine SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. Its high throughput ability allows epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 research in large population-based studies. Inclusion of additional pathogens into the panel as well as separate assessment of Ig isotypes will furthermore allow addressing research questions beyond SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence.",2021,/,Viruses,13,5,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13050749,33923338,#103759,Butt 2021,,,0,0.403957248
Characterization of myocardial injury in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Caro-Codon, Juan; Rey, Juan R; Buno, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M; Rosillo, Sandra O; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Merino, Carlos; Marco, Irene; Martinez, Luis A; Garcia-Veas, Jose M; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; Lopez-de-Sa, Esteban; Merino, Jose L; CARD-COVID Investigators","BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury has been identified as a common complication in patients with COVID-19. However, recent research has serious limitations, such as non-guideline definition of myocardial injury, heterogenicity of troponin sampling or very short-term follow-up. Using data from a large European cohort, we aimed to overcome these pitfalls and adequately characterize myocardial damage in COVID-19., METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and available high-sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied., RESULTS: A total of 918 patients (mean age 63.2+/-15.5 years, 60.1% male) with a median follow-up of 57 (49-63) days were included. Of these, 190 (20.7%) fulfilled strict criteria for myocardial injury (21.1% chronic, 76.8% acute non-ischemic, 2.1% acute ischemic). Time from onset of symptoms to maximum hs-TnI was 11 (7-18) days. Thrombotic and bleeding events, arrhythmias, heart failure, need for mechanical ventilation and death were significantly more prevalent in patients with higher hs-TnI concentrations, even without fulfilling criteria for myocardial injury. hs-TnI was identified as an independent predictor of mortality [HR 2.52 (1.57-4.04) per 5-logarithmic units increment] after adjusting for multiple relevant covariates., CONCLUSION: Elevated hs-TnI is highly prevalent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even mild elevations well below the 99th URL were significantly associated with higher rates of cardiac and non-cardiac complications, and higher mortality. Future research should address the role of serial hs-TnI assessment to improve COVID-19 prognostic stratification and clinical outcomes. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Modelling the spread of sars-cov-2 pandemic-impact of lockdowns & interventions,"Agrawal, Manindra; Vidyasagar, M.; Kanitkar, Madhuri ","Background & objectives: To handle the current COVID-19 pandemic in India, multiple strategies have been applied and implemented to slow down the virus transmission. These included clinical management of active cases, rapid development of treatment strategies, vaccines computational modelling and statistical tools to name a few. This article presents a mathematical model for a time series prediction and analyzes the impact of the lockdown. Method(s): Several existing mathematical models were not able to account for asymptomatic patients, with limited testing capability at onset and no data on serosurveillance. In this study, a new model was used which was developed on lines of susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) to assess the impact of the lockdown and make predictions on its future course. Four parameters were used, namely beta, gamma, eta and epsilon. beta measures the likelihood of the susceptible person getting infected, and gamma denotes recovery rate of patients. The ratio beta/gamma is denoted by R0 (basic reproduction number). Result(s): The disease spread was reduced due to initial lockdown. An increase in gamma reflects healthcare and hospital services, medications and protocols put in place. In Delhi, the predictions from the model were corroborated with July and September serosurveys, which showed antibodies in 23.5 and 33 per cent population, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: The SAIR model has helped understand the disease better. If the model is correct, we may have reached herd immunity with about 380 million people already infected. However, personal protective measures remain crucial. If there was no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at close to 14.7 million, resulted in more than 2.6 million deaths, and the peak would have arrived by June 2020. The number of deaths with the current trends may be less than 0.2 million.Copyright Â© 2021 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.",2021,/,"Indian Journal of Medical Research, Supplement",153,02-Jan,175-181,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_4051_20,2006911611,#98860,Agrawal 2021,,,0,0.301314786
"Anxiety, sleep disorders and self-efficacy among nurses during COVID-19 pandemic: A large cross-sectional study","Simonetti, Valentina; Durante, Angela; Ambrosca, Rossella; Arcadi, Paola; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Simeone, Silvio; Vellone, Ercole; Alvaro, Rosaria; Graziano, Giusi; Cicolini, Giancarlo ","AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of anxiety, sleep disorders and self-efficacy and their predicting factors among nurses facing COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world determined a series of modifications of several National Health Service organisations, with a potential series of psychological consequences among nurses, who were particularly afflicted by this situation of changes and precariousness. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February-April 2020. METHOD(S): A total of 1,005 nurses employed in different Italian hospital wards, during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited. Analyses were based on descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study. RESULT(S): The prevalence of sleep disturbances, moderate anxiety and low self-efficacy was 71.4%, 33.23% and 50.65%, respectively. We found a positive correlation between anxiety and sleep quality (0.408; p < .0001) and negative correlations between self-efficacy and anxiety (-0.217; p < .0001) and sleep quality and self-efficacy (-0.134; p < .0001). The factor independently associated with all variables was gender. Females were more prone to sleep disturbances, anxiety and low levels of self-efficacy than males (p < .05). CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of anxiety, sleep disorders and low self-efficacy among Italian nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was high. Healthcare managers should recognise and consider these results to reduce the risk of the onset of major mental problems that could result in post-traumatic stress disorder. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses facing major incidents as COVID-19 pandemic are among healthcare personnel exposed to a high risk to develop psychological disturbance that should be assessed and recognised, in order to find helpful coping strategies to inform support services and avoid to hesitate in post-traumatic stress disorders.Copyright Â© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,/,Journal of clinical nursing,30,10-Sep,1360-1371,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15685,634198566,#104364,Simonetti 2021,,,0,0.556033938

Burnout syndrome in medical oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: Argentinian national survey,"Guercovich, Andres; Piazzioni, Gonzalo; Waisberg, Federico; Mando, Pablo; Angel, Martin ","Burnout (BO) syndrome is a condition that results in physical and mental distress. The current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly affecting the mental health of the general population. We aimed to assess the incidence of BO among medical oncologists and determine factors associated with burnout levels during the current pandemic. Method(s): A digital survey was created for this study. The Spanish-validated version of Maslach BO Inventory was incorporated to define BO. Social and demographic information was analysed to remove duplicated answers. Result(s): A total of 188 Argentinian medical oncologists from 16 cities participated in the survey. The median age of the participants was 43 years (IQR 38-50) and a similar distribution between male and female was observed. At the time of the survey, Argentina was in the third month of strict lockdown. Most of the participants practiced in both public and private practice facilities (55.3%) and the majority reported more than 10 years of experience (53.2%). Twenty-five percent (43) of subjects reported high levels of DP, 39.9% (75) reported high levels of EE and 53.7% (101) reported low levels of PA. BO Maslach criteria were fulfilled by 14.9% (28). We compared this result with other burnout assessment tools. Using the Gil-Monte and Neira tool, BO-associated domains were altered in 77.1%, 42% and 42% for EE, DP, and PA domains, respectively. Concomitantly, under Neira assessment a domain impairment was appreciated in 77.1%, 76% and 54% respectively. BO criteria were met by 30.3% (57) according to Gil-Monte and 47.9% (90) to Neira. Conclusion(s): BO is a multifaceted issue with a negative impact on physicians, patients, and institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BO criteria was met in a considerable proportion of survey respondents using MBI, and Peiro and Neiro tools and younger age, use of antidepressants and psychological medications and income reduction arose as statistically significant factors after multivariate analysis.Copyright: Â© the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

Challenges in the diagnostic approach of suspected pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients.,"Stals, Milou Anne Maria; Kaptein, Fleur; Kroft, Lucia; Klok, F A; Huisman, Menno V","Accumulating studies on COVID-19 patients report high incidences of thrombotic complications, but guidance on the best diagnostic approach for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients is lacking. Diagnosing PE in these patients is challenging as signs and symptoms of PE and COVID-19 show wide overlap, D-dimer levels are often elevated in the absence of thrombosis and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) may be unfeasible in the case of severe renal impairment and/or hemodynamic instability. This narrative review discusses available literature and guidelines on current diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE in special patient populations, in particular COVID-19. A special focus is on reviewing the literature aimed at identifying symptoms with a high suspicion for PE and on the diagnostic performance of diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE in the setting of COVID-19.Based on available literature, the index of suspicion for PE should be high in the case of unexplained abrupt worsening of respiratory status, typical symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis and/or acute unexplained right ventricular dysfunction. Despite the lack of prospective diagnostic management studies, we propose to adhere to current diagnostic algorithms applying assessment of pre-test probability and D-dimer testing as available evidence suggests that these might be considered safe. Preferably, algorithms using adjusted D-dimer thresholds are recommended as it likely improves the yield of the clinical decision rule/D-dimer combination.",2021,/,Postgraduate medicine,,"0401147, pfk",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1920723,33910469,#103589,Stals 2021,,,0,0.046577878
[Epidemiological features and mechanism of coronavirus disease 2019 in children].,"Deng, Quan-Min; Liang, Ping; Liu, Han-Min","Compared with adults, children tend to have lower incidence rate, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while the cause of such age-based differences in disease severity remains unclear. An investigation of pathogenesis in children may help to analyze the therapies for the high-risk population. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II is the main receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and can limit pulmonary capillary leakage and inflammation mediated by angiotensin 2 and exert a protective effect against acute lung injury. Its expression decreases with age. Regular vaccination and frequent upper respiratory virus infection in children can lead to regular immune activation, and its combination with strong innate immunity can help to achieve virus clearance in the early stage of infection in children with COVID-19. Meanwhile, there are strong regeneration and repair abilities of alveolar epithelial cells in children, which may help with the early recovery of infection. In addition, risk factors, such as underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, obesity, and smoking, are relatively uncommon in children. Social factors, including home quarantine and timely closure of schools, may help to reduce the infection rate in children. However, children with immunodeficiency are a high-risk population and should be closely monitored.

Neurological complications of covid-19: Underlying mechanisms and management,"Shehata, Ghaydaa A.; Lord, Kevin C.; Grudzinski, Michaela C.; Elsayed, Mohamed; Abdelnaby, Ramy; Elshabrawy, Hatem A. ","COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by the newly identified human coron-avirus (HCoV) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was discovered in December 2019, and in March 2020, the disease was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to a high number of cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, several studies have reported neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. Headache, dizziness, loss of taste and smell, encephalitis, encephalopathy, and cerebrovascu-lar diseases are the most common neurological complications that are associated with COVID-19. In addition, seizures, neuromuscular junctions' disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome were reported as complications of COVID-19, as well as neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders. However, the management of these conditions remains a challenge. In this review, we discuss the prevalence, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of these neurological sequelae that are secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to update neurologists and healthcare workers on the possible neurological complications associated with COVID-19 and the management of these disease conditions.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

Revealing the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations to antibody therapies.,"Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guo-Wei","The ongoing massive vaccination and the development of effective intervention offer the long-awaited hope to end the global rage of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapidly growing SARS-CoV-2 variants might compromise existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. Although there are valuable experimental studies about the potential threats from emerging variants, the results are limited to a handful of mutations and Eli Lilly and Regeneron mAbs. The potential threats from frequently occurring mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to many mAbs in clinical trials are largely unknown. We fill the gap by developing a topology-based deep learning strategy that is validated with tens of thousands of experimental data points. We analyze 261,348 genome isolates from patients to identify 514 non-degenerate RBD mutations and investigate their impacts on 16 mAbs in clinical trials. Our findings, which are highly consistent with existing experimental results about variants from the UK, South Africa, Brazil, US-California, and Mexico shed light on potential threats of 95 high-frequency mutations to mAbs not only from Eli Lilly and Regeneron but also from Celltrion and Rockefeller University that are in clinical trials. We unveil, for the first time, that high-frequency mutations R346K/S, N439K, G446V, L455F, V483F/A, E484Q/V/A/G/D, F486L, F490L/V/S, Q493L, and S494P/L might compromise some of mAbs in clinical trials.

Growing populations of precarious migrants (including undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees) in the UK and Europe are considered to be under-immunised groups and may be excluded from health systems, yet little is known about their views on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, which are essential to identify key solutions and action points to strengthen vaccine roll-out. <h4>Methods</h4> We did an in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview study of recently arrived migrants (foreign-born, >18 years old; <10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake. We used the â€˜Three Csâ€™ model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising. The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630). <h4>Results</h4> We approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (n = 3), asylum seekers (n = 19), undocumented migrants (n = 8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (n = 2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions). 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need. Participants reported a range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine and expressed concerns that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out. Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine. All participants (n = 10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this. Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Precarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake. Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities. These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations. <h4>Funding</h4> NIHR",2021,,,,,,PPR313384,10.1101/2021.04.12.21255313,,#102912,Deal 2021,,,0,0.092088502
Comparison of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and diasorin liason SARSCOV-2 S1/S2 IgG antibody assays,"Schaack, Grace A.; Chen, Derrick ","Background: The Abbott Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIASON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay are both chemiluminescent immunoassays that qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The Abbott assay detects IgG against the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the DiaSorin assay uses antigen derived from the viral spike (S) protein. Here we evaluate the performance of these two assays at our institution. Method(s): 45 patient samples (serum or plasma) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by both the Abbott and DiaSorin assays. The samples were previously characterized at a national reference laboratory using the Abbott assay or by an in-house PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples yielding discordant results across platforms were further tested using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay at the reference laboratory. Result(s): 22 samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by the reference lab Abbott assay, and 23 tested positive by the same reference lab test (n = 13) or by an in-house PCR-based test (n = 10). The 22 samples characterized as negative again tested negative by both the Abbott (in-house) and DiaSorin assays (100% NPA). Among the 23 samples characterized as positive, all 23 tested positive by the Abbott assay (100% PPA), while only 15 tested positive by the DiaSorin assay (65% PPA). For each of the 8 discordant cases, samples were further tested by EUROIMMUN assay, which targets the S protein; 7 of the 8 samples tested negative by this assay, in agreement with the DiaSorin test results. Thus, for the discordant cases, testing for IgG against N (in-house and reference lab Abbott assays) gave positive results, while testing for IgG against S (DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays) mostly gave negative results. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of the differences between various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, and providers should be aware of the specific antigenic target(s) in each test. Selection of a specific assay may depend on the need to assess past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (for which a nucleocapsid target may be more sensitive) or to detect neutralizing antibodies (for which a spike target may be more relevant). This also has implications for disease surveillance as reliance on anti-spike antibodies alone may underestimate infection prevalence.",2020,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,7,SUPPL 1,S276-S277,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.612,634732559,#99416,Schaack 2020,,,0,0.968540083

Strategies for Immunomonitoring after Vaccination and during Infection.,"Adam, Lucille; Rosenbaum, Pierre; Bonduelle, Olivia; Combadiere, Behazine","Immunomonitoring is the study of an individual's immune responses over the course of vaccination or infection. In the infectious context, exploring the innate and adaptive immune responses will help to investigate their contribution to viral control or toxicity. After vaccination, immunomonitoring of the correlate(s) and surrogate(s) of protection is a major asset for measuring vaccine immune efficacy. Conventional immunomonitoring methods include antibody-based technologies that are easy to use. However, promising sensitive high-throughput technologies allowed the emergence of holistic approaches. This raises the question of data integration methods and tools. These approaches allow us to increase our knowledge on immune mechanisms as well as the identification of key effectors of the immune response. However, the depiction of relevant findings requires a well-rounded consideration beforehand about the hypotheses, conception, organization and objectives of the immunomonitoring. Therefore, well-standardized and comprehensive studies fuel insight to design more efficient, rationale-based vaccines and therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases. Hence, we will illustrate this review with examples of the immunomonitoring approaches used during vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,/,Vaccines,9,4,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040365,33918841,#103329,Adam 2021,,,0,0.05203272
Prolonged Postoperative Pyrexia and Transient Nonnephrogenic Vasopressin-Analogue-Resistant Polyuria following Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Resection of an Infundibular Epidermoid Cyst.,"Yoneoka, Yuichiro; Seki, Yasuhiro; Akiyama, Katsuhiko; Sakurai, Yuki; Ohara, Nobumasa; Hasegawa, Go","Prolonged postoperative pyrexia (PPP) due to Mollaret's meningitis following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (eTSS) for an intracranial epidermoid cyst can be confused with postoperative meningeal infection after transsphenoidal resection, especially in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anosmia, as well as dysgeusia, cannot be evaluated in patients of eTSS for a while after surgery. We report a case of an infundibular epidermoid cyst with post-eTSS Mollaret's meningitis (MM). The post-eTSS MM caused vasopressin-analogue-resistant polyuria (VARP) in synchronization with PPP. A 59-year-old man experiencing recurrent headaches and irregular bitemporal hemianopsia over three months was diagnosed with a suprasellar tumor. The suprasellar tumor was an infundibular cyst from the infundibular recess to the posterior lobe of the pituitary, which was gross-totally resected including the neurohypophysis via an extended eTSS. Since awakening from general anesthesia after the gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, the patient continuously had suffered from headache until the 13th postoperative day (POD13). The patient took analgesics once a day before the surgery and three times a day after the surgery until POD11. Pyrexia (37.5-39.5 degree Celsius) in synchronization with nonnephrogenic VARP remitted on POD18. Intravenous antibiotics had little effect on changes of pyrexia. Serum procalcitonin values (reference range <0.5 ng/mL) are 0.07 ng/mL on POD12 and 0.06 ng/mL on POD18. His polyuria came to react with sublingual desmopressin after alleviation of pyrexia. He left the hospital under hormone replacement therapy without newly added neurological sequelae other than hypopituitarism. After GTR of an infundibular epidermoid cyst, based on values of serum procalcitonin, post-eTSS MM can be distinguished from infection and can be treated with symptomatic treatments. The postoperative transient nonnephrogenic VARP that differs from usual central diabetes insipidus can react with sublingual desmopressin after alleviation of PPP in the clinical course of post-eTSS MM. An infundibular epidermoid cyst should be sufficiently resected in one sitting to minimize comorbidities, its recurrence, or postoperative MM to the utmost.

"Tired, Worried and Burned Out, but Still Resilient: A Cross-Sectional Study of Mental Health Workers in the UK during the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Pappa, Sofia; Barnett, Joshua; Berges, Ines; Sakkas, Nikolaos","The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems and the physical and mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been substantial. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of mental health workers who provide care to a vulnerable patient population that have been particularly affected during this crisis. A total of 387 HCWs from across a large urban mental health service completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic, lifestyle and work-based information and validated psychometric scales. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively; sleep problems with the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); and resilience with the Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential mediating factors. Prevalence of burnout was notable, with 52% recording moderate/severe in Emotional Exhaustion, 19.5% moderate/severe in Depersonalisation, and 55.5% low/moderate Personal Accomplishment. Over half of all respondents (52%) experienced sleep problems; the presence of depressive symptoms was a significant predictor of insomnia. An increase in potentially harmful lifestyle changes, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and overeating was also observed. However, high Resilience was reported by 70% of the samples and the importance of this is highlighted. Female gender was associated with increased levels of depression and emotional exhaustion while those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk of affective symptoms, insomnia, and burnout. Overall, our study revealed considerable levels of psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies but also resilience and satisfaction with organizational support provided.

Inflammatory and Prothrombotic Biomarkers Associated With the Severity of COVID-19 Infection,"Garcia-Larragoiti, Nallely; Cano-Mendez, Alan; Blancas-Ayala, Kenia; Damian-Vazquez, Guadalupe; Perez-Medina, Ana Itzel; Viveros-Sandoval, Martha Eva; Lopez-Castaneda, Sandra; Chora-Hernandez, Luis David; Arean-Martinez, Carlos ","Among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, high incidence of alterations in inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers correlates with a poor prognosis. Comorbidities such as chronic degenerative diseases are frequently associated with complications in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory and procoagulant biomarkers in COVID-19 patients from a public hospital in Mexico. Blood was sampled within the first 48 h after admission in 119 confirmed COVID-19 patients that were classified in 3 groups according to oxygen demand, evolution and the severity of the disease as follows: 1) Non severe: nasal cannula or oxygen mask; 2) Severe: high flow nasal cannula and 3) Death: mechanical ventilation eventually leading to fatal outcome. Blood samples from 20 healthy donors were included as a Control Group. Analysis of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers including D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, PAI-1, P-selectin and VWF was performed in plasma. Routine laboratory and clinical biomarkers were also included and compared among groups. Concentrations of D-dimer (14.5 +/- 13.8 microg/ml) and PAI-1 (1223 +/- 889.6 ng/ml) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (P < 0.0001). A significant difference was found in interleukin-6, PAI-1 and P-selectin in non-severe and healthy donors when compared to Severe COVID-19 and deceased patients (P < 0.001). VWF levels were also significantly different between severe patients (153.5 +/- 24.3 UI/dl) and non-severe ones (133.9 +/- 20.2 UI/dl) (P < 0.0001).

The Effects of Displacing Sedentary Behavior With Two Distinct Patterns of Light Activity on Health Outcomes in Older Adults (Implications for COVID-19 Quarantine),"Grant, Dale; Tomlinson, David; Kolic, Petra; Onambele-Pearson, Gladys Leopoldine; Tsintzas, Kostas ","Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic is limiting outdoor and community-based activities, especially for older adults owing to the requirement for self-isolation, potentially increasing prolonged sedentary behavior (SB). Given a poor tolerance for intense exercise, SB displacement with light intensity physical activity (LIPA) is a promising health enhancing alternative. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of two different types of SB displacement on health outcomes in older adults and any differential impact of associated LIPA pattern. Method(s): 28 older women (age: 73 +/- 5 years, height: 1.60 +/- 0.07 m, weight: 67 +/- 10 kg, and BMI: 26.1 +/- 3.6 kg/m2) underwent overnight fasted dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging, blood sampling, and functional assessments before being randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) single continuous bout of 45-50 min LIPA daily (n = 14); or (2) SB fragmentation (SBF; ~48 min LIPA daily, 2 min LIPA for every 30 min of SB; n = 14). Compliance was systematically monitored using tri-axial accelerometery. All measures were taken at weeks 0 and 8. Result(s): Physical behavior significantly altered (decreased SB/increased LIPA; p < 0.05) and to a similar extent in both groups. We observed a significant reduction in serum triglycerides [p = 0.045, effect size (np 2) = 0.15; SBF: -0.26 +/- 0.77 mmol/L, LIPA: -0.26 +/- 0.51 mmol/L], improved 30 s sit-to-stand (STS) count (p = 0.002, np 2 = 0.32, 2 +/- 3 STS) and speed (p = 0.009, np 2 = 0.35, -10 +/- 33%), as well as increased average handgrip strength (p = 0.001, np 2 = 0.45, 6 +/- 12%), and gait speed (p = 0.005, np 2 = 0.27, 0.09 +/- 0.16 m/s) in both groups. Interestingly, SBF caused a greater increase in peak handgrip strength (8 +/- 14%), compared to LIPA (2 +/- 10%; p = 0.04, np 2 = 0.38). Conclusion(s): SB displacement induced significant improvements in fasting triglycerides, gait speed, as-well as STS endurance/speed in older women. Frequent vs. continuous SB displacement also caused greater increases in handgrip strength. While both SB displacement protocols display promise as efficacious home-based interventions for self-isolating older adults, our results would suggest a physical functioning advantage of the SBF protocol for certain outcomes.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Grant, Tomlinson, Tsintzas, Kolic and Onambele-Pearson.",2020,/,Frontiers in Physiology,11,"(Grant, Tomlinson, Kolic, Onambele-Pearson) Department of Sports and Exercise Sciences, Research Centre for Musculoskeletal Science and Sports Medicine, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom(Tsintzas) MRC Versus Arthritis Centre f",574595,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.574595,633743142,#98746,Grant 2020,,,0,0.344429113

Most children with acute COVID-19 have mild disease, but coagulopathy has been associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a post-infectious complication. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence of thrombosis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C and to evaluate associated risk factors. We classified patients into one of three groups for analysis: COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2. Among a total of 853 admissions (426 COVID-19, 138 MIS-C, and 289 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2) in 814 patients, there were 20 patients with thrombotic events (TE) (including 1 stroke). Patients with MIS-C had the highest incidence (6.5%, 9/138) versus COVID-19 (2.1%, 9/426) or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (0.7%, 2/289). In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, the majority of thrombotic events (89%) occurred in patients >=12 years. Patients > 12 years with MIS-C had the highest rate of thrombosis at 19% (9/48). Notably, 71% of TE that were not present on admission occurred despite thromboprophylaxis. Multivariable analysis identified the following as significantly associated with thrombosis: age >=12 years, cancer, presence of a central venous catheter, and MIS-C. In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, hospital mortality was 2.3% (13/564), but was 28% (5/18) in patients with thrombotic events. Our findings may help inform pediatric thromboprophylaxis strategies.

To counter COVID-19 spreading, an infrastructure to provide rapid and thorough molecular diagnostics and serology testing is the cornerstone of outbreak and pandemic management. We hereby review the clinical insights with regard to using molecular tests and immunoassays in the context of COVID-19 management life cycle: the preventive phase, the preparedness phase, the response phase and the recovery phase. The spatial and temporal distribution of viral RNA, antigens and antibodies during human infection is summarized to provide a biological foundation for accurate detection of the disease. We shared the lessons learned and the obstacles encountered during real world high-volume screening programs. Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests. Leverage technologies, such as engineered polymerases, isothermal amplification, and direct amplification from complex matrices may improve the productivity of current infrastructure, while emerging technologies like CRISPR diagnostics, visual end point detection, and PCR free methods for nucleic acid sensing may lead to at-home tests.

","Background: In Michigan, 44,964 (68%) of the 66,269 COVID-19 patients have recovered. However, there is concern that COVID-19 infection may lead to long-term sequelae, including pulmonary defects, cardiac complications, blood clots, and neurocognitive impairment. This study describes the 30-day outcomes of patients who had recovered. Method(s): From 3/16/2020 to 5/19/2020, a follow-up was attempted for patients who were discharged alive from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and had recovered. Recovery was defined as being alive 30 days post symptom-onset. A telephone survey was conducted 30 days post-index admission and recorded in electronic medical records. Oxygen (O2) requirements, symptoms, readmissions and the need for antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections were evaluated. Result(s): 585 patients met inclusion criteria and were contacted by phone; 303 answered their phone (Table 1), but only 266 (45%) completed a full telephone encounter and were included in the final analysis (Table 2).

This study aimed at assessing the number of new cancers during and after the lockdown., METHODS: We prospectively collected the clinical data of the 11.4 million patients referred to the Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris Teaching Hospital. We identified new cancer cases between 1st January 2018 and 31st September 2020 and compared indicators for 2018 and 2019 to 2020 with a focus on the French lockdown (17th March to 11th May 2020) across cancer types and patient age classes., RESULTS: Between January and September, 28,348, 27,272 and 23,734 new cancer cases were identified in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The monthly median number of new cases reached 3168 (interquartile range, IQR, 3027; 3282), 3054 (IQR 2945; 3127) and 2723 (IQR 2085; 2,863) in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. From March 1st to May 31st, new cancer decreased by 30% in 2020 compared to the 2018-19 average; then by 9% from 1st June to 31st September. This evolution was consistent across all tumour types: -30% and -9% for colon, -27% and -6% for lung, -29% and -14% for breast, -33% and -12% for prostate cancers, respectively. For patients aged <70 years, the decrease of colorectal and breast new cancers in April between 2018 and 2019 average and 2020 reached 41% and 39%, respectively., CONCLUSION: The SARS-Cov2 pandemic led to a substantial decrease in new cancer cases.

Acetylcysteine for treatment of remdesivir-induced acute liver failure in COVID-19,"Carothers, Chancey; Birrer, Kara; Vo, Mai ","INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir is a direct-acting nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor with activity against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus used in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here we describe a case of suspected remdesivir-induced acute liver failure (ALF) successfully treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. METHOD(S): A 68-year-old female was identified as COVID-19 positive while in the operating room undergoing multi-vessel cardiac bypass surgery. While previously asymptomatic, she required intensive care unit admission for worsening oxygenation on post-operative day (POD) 2, and remdesivir was initiated. On POD 3, amiodarone was initiated for new onset atrial fibrillation. By POD 4 (remdesivir day 3, amiodarone day 2), the patient developed an AST/ALT of >5000 units/L each, a total bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL, and an ammonia of 161 umol/L. Remdesivir and amiodarone were discontinued and continuous infusion acetylcysteine was initiated using the 21-hour acetaminophen toxicity protocol of 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, and 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. By the end of the 21-hour infusion, the AST/ ALT had decreased to 1348/1861 units/L. The patient's LFTs and total bilirubin returned to normal within 14 days of discontinuation of remdesivir (POD 18). The patient was discharged home with home health 4 days later (POD 22). RESULT(S): Remdesivir has been reported in practice to cause transaminitis up to 5-10 times the upper limit of normal based on early clinical trials, and the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued by the FDA requires ongoing monitoring of ALT throughout therapy. Due to remdesivir only recently being widely used in clinical practice, the incidence of remdesivir-induced ALF is unclear. Amiodarone was unlikely the cause of ALF due to very recent timing of initiation and the rapid resolution of symptoms once discontinued despite the long half-life of amiodarone. While acetylcysteine is FDA approved only for acetaminophen overdose, there are small studies and case reports of its use in nonacetaminophen- induced liver failure. The use of a novel, unapproved therapy through an EUA program may place patients at risk for unexpected adverse events and, in this case, the patient's acute liver failure resolved after treatment with acetylcysteine.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,114,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726904.87092.3e,634767036,#101646,Carothers 2021,,,0,0.968383018
POS-534 TRAJECTORIES OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS BY SURVIVAL,"Lasky, R.; Chaudhuri, S.; Jiao, Y.; Larkin MS, J.; Monaghan, C.; Usvyat, L.; Winter, A.; Raimann, J.; Neri, L.; Kotanko, P.; Hymes, J.; Lee, S.; Kooman, J.; Maddux, F. ","Introduction: We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory assessments associated with COVID-19 in hemodialysis (HD) patients who survived or died within 30 days after suspicion. For comparison, we also evaluated consistent trajectories before suspicion in patients tested for SARS CoV-2 who were found to be COVID-19 negative. Method(s): We used data from adult (age >=18 years) HD patients treated at a national dialysis network (Fresenius Kidney Care, Waltham, MA) in the United States who received RT-PCR testing to investigate suspicion of a SARS-CoV-2 infection between 01 May and 01 Sep 2020. Suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined at presentation by active signs and symptoms of a flu-like illness. We excluded data from patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 who did not have a documented RT-PCR result, which included asymptomatic patients who were exposed to someone with known COVID-19 and were monitored for symptoms. Using an exploratory analysis design, we computed mean daily values for an array of variables 90 days before the first date of suspicion. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time since suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who were confirmed by RT-PCR test to be positive or negative for COVID-19. Among COVID-19 positive patients, we stratified data for those who survived or died within 30 days of suspicion; trajectories were plotted 90 days after suspicion in survivors and up to 30 days after suspicion in COVID-19 in patients who died. Result(s): There were 12,836 HD patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 who received RT-PCR testing (8,895 COVID-19 positive: mean age 61.8 years, 54% male, 37% white race, 69% with diabetes, 24% with ischemic heart disease (IHD); 3,941 COVID-19 negative: mean age 60.3 years, 55% male, 43% white race, 66% with diabetes, 24% with IHD). The trajectories for several clinical/laboratory parameters (vital signs, hematology, nutrition, iron indices) appeared to have changed about 10 days before suspicion among patients who were confirmed COVID-19 positive; the trends were distinct as compared to patients found to be COVID negative (select variables shown in Figure 1). Many alternations in variables before COVID-19 were subtle. HD patients with COVID-19 who died within 30 days of suspicion were more often older, male, white race, and had a higher comorbidity burden (998 died: mean age 69.1 years, 60% male, 42% white race, 80% with diabetes, 29% with IHD; 7,897 survived: mean age 60.8 years, 53% male, 37% white race, 68% with diabetes, 23% with IHD). There appeared to be unique trajectories before and after suspicion of COVID-19 in patients who died versus those who survived (select variables shown in Figure 1). [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): The trajectories of several clinical/laboratory parameters appeared to change before and after suspicion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Survivors appeared to have distinct trajectories in clinical/laboratory parameters compared to patients who died within 30 days of COVID-19. These findings appear to reveal some of the pathophysiologic trends defining the onset and course of the disease in the HD population; however, many changes were small. These insights are anticipated to be of high importance for development of predictive models for early identification and prognosis of COVID-19.

[Management of COVID-19 mass casualty incidents in nursing and retirement homes].,"Schreiber, Wolfgang; Wolf, Philipp; Bigalke, Nicole; Bigalke, Marc U; Graf, Bernhard M; Dittmar, Michael S","BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outbreaks in inpatient care facilities, which grow into a large-scale emergency scenario, are frequently observed. A standardized procedure analogous to algorithms for mass casualty incidents (MCI) is lacking., METHODS: Based on a case report and the literature, the authors present a management strategy for infectious MCI during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and distinguish it from traumatic MCI deployment tactics., RESULTS: This management strategy can be divided into three phases, beginning with the acute emergency response including triage, stabilization of critical patients, and transport of patients requiring hospitalization. Phase 2 involves securing the facility's operational readiness, or housing residents elsewhere in case staff are infected or quarantined to a relevant degree. Phase 3 marks the return to regular operations., DISCUSSION: Phase 1 is based on usual MCI principles, phase 2 on hospital crisis management. Avoiding evacuation of residents to relieve hospitals is an important operational objective. The lack of mission and training experience with such situations, the limited applicability of established triage algorithms, and the need to coordinate a large number of participants pose challenges., CONCLUSION: This strategic model offers a practical, holistic approach to the management of infectious mass casualty scenarios in nursing facilities.",2021,/,"Medizinische Klinik, Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin",,101575086,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00063-021-00816-1,33877426,#101531,Schreiber 2021,,,0,0.693627785
"Asthma and risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality from COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Sunjaya, Anthony P.; Allida, Sabine M.; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Jenkins, Christine ","Objective: As COVID-19 spreads across the world, there are concerns that people with asthma are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease, or of poorer outcomes. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. Data sources and study selection: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. Result(s): Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68-1.10; p = 0.25). Conclusion(s): The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma. The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID-19 and have similar clinical outcomes. angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2; United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; coronavirus disease 2019; intensive care unit; inhaled corticosteroids; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; relative risk reduction; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Copyright Â© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,/,Journal of Asthma,,"(Sunjaya, Jenkins) Respiratory Division, The George Institute for Global Health, Newtown, NSW, Australia(Sunjaya, Allida, Di Tanna, Jenkins) School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia(All",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1888116,2011037785,#98816,Sunjaya 2021,,,0,0.086369533
Conservative and liberal approaches in determining indications for invasive ventilation in COVID-19,"Merkulova, Irina; Avetisyan, Eric; Pevsner, Dmitriy; Gruzdev, Kirill; Boytsov, Sergey; Shreyder, Katherine ","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19-associated lung injury distinguishes from classic ARDS in its pathophysiological mechanisms. Lower threshold of P/F ratio as an indication for invasive ventilation can probably improve overall survival by decreasing the amount of intubations and associated complications. METHOD(S): Two comparable ICUs of the hospital were divided on the basis of the respiratory management approaches. For the intubation conservative approach P/F ratio were assumed <150 mmHg and liberal approach were assumed <110 mmHg. Other treatment protocols, including other indications for invasive mechanical ventilation, were identical. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality, duration of hospital stay, duration of ICU stay; secondary endpoints were the frequency of major bleeding, thrombotic complications, acute kidney injury, vasopressors use, bacterial co-infection. RESULT(S): There were 34 patients in the conservative group and 27 patients in the liberal group. The groups were comparable in age, sex, comorbidities, drug therapy on admission, CRP and IL-6 levels, severity of lung injury. The MV was used in 91.2% and NIV in 29.4% (76.9% was switched to MV) in the conservative group. In the liberal group, MV was used in 48.1% of patients and NIV in 74.1% of patients (30.0% was switched to MV). We observed the significant reduction of the in-hospital mortality in the liberal group in comparison with the conservative group (51.9% vs 76.5%, p = 0.044). There was no significant difference in the other primary endpoints between two groups. For secondary endpoints, statistically significant differences were obtained in the incidence of bacterial co-infection (61.8% versus 30.8%, p = 0.017); and venous thrombosis (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.041). There were no significant difference in the other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with severe COVID-19- associated lung injury, following the classical protocol for determining indications for invasive MV leads to a significant increase in the incidence of venous thrombosis, bacterial co-infection, and mortality in comparison with the liberal approach, which turned out to be valid and demonstrated an advantage in such patients.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,126,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000727004.68076.a8,634767242,#101688,Merkulova 2021,,,0,0.311565611
A remote management system for control and surveillance of echinococcosis: design and implementation based on internet of things.,"Yang, Shi-Jie; Xiao, Ning; Li, Jing-Zhong; Feng, Yu; Ma, Jun-Ying; Quzhen, Gong-Sang; Yu, Qing; Zhang, Ting; Yi, Shi-Cheng; Zhou, Xiao-Nong","BACKGROUND: As a neglected cross-species parasitic disease transmitted between canines and livestock, echinococcosis remains a global public health concern with a heavy disease burden. In China, especially in the epidemic pastoral communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the harsh climate, low socio-economic status, poor overall hygiene, and remote and insufficient access to all owned dogs exacerbate the difficulty in implementing the ambitious control programme for echinococcosis. We aimed to design and implement a remote management system (RMS) based on internet of things (IoT) for control and surveillance of echinococcosis by combining deworming devices to realise long-distance smart deworming control, smooth statistical analysis and result display. New methods and tools are urgently needed to increase the deworming coverage and frequency, promote real-time scientific surveillance, and prevent transmission of echinococcosis in remoted transmission areas., METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, we had cooperated and developed the smart collar and smart feeder with the Central Research Institute of Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Shenzhen Jizhi Future Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). From September 2019 to March 2020, We had proposed the RMS based on IoT as a novel tool to control smart deworming devices to deliver efficient praziquantel (PZQ) baits to dogs regularly and automatically and also as a smart digital management platform to monitor, analyse, and display the epidemic trends of echinococcosis dynamically, in real time in Hezuo City, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Starting from January 2018, The RMS has been maintained and upgraded by Shanghai Yier Information Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The database was based on MySQL tools and the Chi-square test was used to probe the difference and changes of variables in different groups., RESULTS: The smart collars are fully capable of anti-collision, waterproof, and cold-proof performance, and the battery's energy is sufficient, the anti-collision rate, water-proof rate, cold-proof rate and voltage normal rate is 99.6% (521/523), 100.0% (523/523), 100.0% (523/523) and 100.0% (523/523), respectively. The RMS can accurately analyse the monitoring data and parameters including positive rates of canine faeces, and the prevalence of echinococcosis in the general population livestock, and children. The data of dogs deworming and surveillance for echinococcosis is able to be controlled using RMS and has expanded gradually in townships to the whole Hezuo region. The automatic delivering PZQ rate, collar positioning rate, deliver PZQ reminding rate, and fault report rate is 91.1% (1914/2102), 92.1% (13 580/14 745), 92.1% (1936/2102) and 84.7% (1287/1519), respectively. After using the RMS from 2019, the missing rate of monitoring data decreased from 32.1% (9/28) to 0 (0/16). A total of 48 administrators (3, 3, 8, 11, 23 at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels, respectively) participated in the questionnaire survey, with 93.8% of its overall satisfaction rate., CONCLUSIONS: The existing difficulties and challenges in the way of prevention and control for echinococcosis can partially be resolved using the innovative, IoT-based technologies and tools.

"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk of COVID-19 vaccinated, lactating health care workers","Valcarce, Vivian; Stafford, Lauren; Neu, Josef; Cacho, Nicole; Parker, Leslie; Mueller, Martina; Burchfield, David; Li, Nan; Larkin, Joseph","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Importance</h4> In 2019, a deadly virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, emerged. In December 2020, two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States (US) which provide immunity to those receiving the vaccine. Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of infantsâ€™ immunity. Certain vaccines given to pregnant and lactating mothers provide immunity to infants through transmission across the placenta, umbilical cord (IgG) and human milk (IgA). Human milk produced by mothers with a history of COVID-19 infection contains SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. <h4>Objective</h4> To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins are found in human milk after the COVID-19 vaccination, and to characterize the types of immunoglobulins present. <h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4> This is a prospective observational study conducted at Shands Hospital, University of Florida from December 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-two lactating healthcare workers who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna) made up the sample group. Plasma and human milk were collected at three-time points (pre-vaccination, post-first vaccine dose, and post-second vaccine dose). SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and in plasma were measured by ELISA. Maternal demographics was compiled. <h4>Exposures</h4> Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna vaccination. <h4>Main outcome and measure</h4> Levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma. <h4>Results</h4> We found significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. <h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4> Our results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG secretion in human milk. Further studies are needed to determine the duration of this immune response, its capacity to neutralize the COVID-19 virus, the transfer of passive immunity to breastfeeding infants, and the potential therapeutic use of human milk IgA to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19. <h4>KEY POINTS</h4> <h4>Question</h4> Is there SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk of lactating women after COVID-19 vaccination? <h4>Findings</h4> In this prospective observational study that included 22 lactating women, we found SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk in response to the COVID-19 vaccination series. There is statistically significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series completion (p < 0.0001). <h4>Meaning</h4> Newborn immunologic defense is present but immature. SARS-CoV-2 IgA secreted in the human milk could potentially provide COVID-19 protection to nursing infants. These results could guide a strategy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among lactating women.",2021,,,,,,PPR311542,10.1101/2021.04.02.21254642,,#99533,Valcarce 2021,,,0,0.016567169

The effects of tocilizumab on clinical and laboratory features of patients with severe COVID-19: A single center experience,"Ashimov, Jamalbek; Kudaiberdiev, Taalaibek; Gaybyldaev, Janybek; Zaripov, Dolonbek; Akhmedova, Irina; Abibillaev, Damirbek ","Objective: Cytokine storm is considered as the immune hyperinflammatory process which may deteriorate the course of COVID-19. Interleukin (IL-6) inhibitors can be used in severe COVID-19 patients due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. We aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of tocilizumab (Actemra) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): Overall, 1382 patients were admitted to a temporary hospital during July outbreak of COVID-19. Of these, 282 patients were hospitalized. Baseline clinical, radiological and laboratory data were collected from patient records. Laboratory markers prior to discharge were also collected. Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to show the significance of change of laboratory markers. Result(s): Eleven of the 282(3.9%) hospitalized patients who had severe pneumonia confirmed by either chest radiography (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) received tocilizumab (Actemra). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral markers of COVID-19 were positive in three cases.

"Global emerging resistance in pediatric infections with TB, HIV, and gram-negative pathogens","Enane, Leslie A.; Christenson, John C. ","Infants, children and adolescents are at risk of life-threatening, antimicrobial-resistant infections. Global burdens of drug-resistant TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens have a particular impact on paediatric age groups, necessitating a paediatric-focused agenda to address emerging resistance. Dedicated approaches are needed to find, successfully treat and prevent resistant infections in paediatric populations worldwide. Challenges include the diagnosis and identification of resistant infections, limited access to novel antimicrobials or to paediatric-friendly formulations, limited access to research and clinical trials and implementation challenges related to prevention and successful completion of treatment. In this review, the particular complexities of emerging resistance in TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens in children, with attention to both clinical and public health challenges, are highlighted. Key principles of a paediatric-focused agenda to address antimicrobial resistance are outlined. They include quality of care, increasing equitable access to key diagnostics, expanding antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention across global settings, and health system strengthening. Increased access to research studies, including clinical trials, is needed. Further study and implementation of care models and strategies for child- or adolescent-centred management of infections such as HIV and TB can critically improve outcome and avoid development of resistance. As the current global pandemic of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, threatens to disrupt health systems and services for vulnerable populations, this is a critical time to mitigate against a potential surge in the incidence of resistant infections.Copyright Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,/,Paediatrics and International Child Health,41,1,65-75,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20469047.2020.1853350,2007572370,#102266,Enane 2021,,,0,0.563450005
Bell's Palsy as a Late Neurologic Manifestation of COVID-19 Infection,"Oke, I. O.; Oladunjoye, O. O.; Oladunjoye, A. O.; Paudel, A.; Zimmerman, R.","Bell's palsy is acute peripheral facial nerve palsy; its cause is often unknown but it can be triggered by acute viral infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, but neurologic complications have been reported. A few studies have reported the occurrence of facial nerve palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a case of Bell's palsy in a 36-year-old man with COVID-19 infection and a past medical history of nephrolithiasis. He presented to the emergency room with a day history of sudden right facial weakness and difficulty closing his right eye four weeks following a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Physical examination revealed right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy (House-Brackmann grade IV). Serologic screen for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 were negative for acute infection; however, neuroimaging with MRI confirmed Bell's palsy. He made remarkable improvement following treatment with a course of valacyclovir and methylprednisolone.

Lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19 patients with influenza coinfection: A retrospective matched-pair cohort study,"Yu, Chong; Pei, Guangchang; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; Zhang, Zhiguo; Guo, Yujiao; Shi, Jing; Liao, Wenhui ","During the early stages of the pandemic, some coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients were misdiagnosed as having influenza, which aroused the concern that some deaths attributed to influenza were actually COVID-19-related. However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P <.001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P =.020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P =.001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,1,472-480,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26260,2005572400,#101808,Yu 2021,,,0,0.576196404

","Introduction: The ongoing SARS-COV-2 pandemic hit the world's population since the first trimester of 2020. Since the beginning it has been clear that the elderly and chronic patients were at greater risk ofmorbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to monitor the spread and outcomes amongpatients in kidney replacement therapy treated in Nephrology-Dialysis units in Piedmont and Valled'Aosta Regions, North-West Italy. Method(s): A web platform accessible by Dialysis coordinators across the first and second wave of the pandemic is still being used to collect and regularly update demographic and clinical data of patients. We present preliminary results on cumulative incidence, risk estimates and measures of association. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19 and Wizard 1.9.47 for Mac. Result(s): An overall of 599 cases has been monitored since March 2020 till November 2020. The cumulative incidence is 10% compared to 3,3% of the general population. A higher cumulative incidence has been observed among Hemodialysis patients (14%), while in peritoneal dialysis patients and transplant receivers' sub-groups it is 5,3% and 6,6%, respectively. Compared to the general population, among dialysis patients, cumulative incidence grew at a slower rate in the first than in the second wave of pandemic (incidence rate ratio of 1,65 for patients compared to 5,9 for the rest of the population). A higher fatality risk is observed among dialysis patients and transplant receivers (17% and11%, respectively) compared to that of the general population of 3,7%. Fatality is associated with age and cardiovascular diseases in both groups. Conclusion(s): The study of an overall population of 599 showed a higher susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection and worse outcomes compared to the general population. We observed increased risks for hemodialysis patients, who are older on average and more exposed to in-hospital infections.

Supplementation of Micronutrients Against COVID-19,"Unnithan, Ajaya Kumar Ayyappan","<h4>Background: </h4> and Objectives: There is no pharmacological treatment with proven efficacy against coronavirus disease-19. Certain micronutrients have roles in the maintenance of an effective immune system. From the point of view of public health, it will be good to adopt a nutrional strategy to enhance the immunity of the general population against viral diseases. Method and Study design: A review was done to now the evidence for the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of micronutrients. A search was done in Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the nutrients with proven effect against viral infection. Experimental studies, clinical studies, reviews, and meta-analyses were studied descripitively. <h4>Results:</h4> There are experimental studies about the effects of micronutrients against viral infection. Vitamins such as A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate, and trace elements such as zinc, selenium, iron, magnesium, and copper boost the immune response. The antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E can help in controlling the â€˜cytokine stormâ€™, produced by excessive inflammation. Vitamin D can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. Selenium and zinc can protect the lungs in acute respiratory distress syndrome. There are many meta-analyses on the randomized controlled trials (RCT) about the effect of micronutrients on viral infection. The analyses of the trials supplementing vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium have shown significance. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> There is level 2A evidence for the beneficial effects of vitamins and micronutrients in modulating the immunity against viral infections.

Face mask attitude over the course of COVID-19: Did younger people behave differently?,"Khan, Rida; Khan, Tooba; Fatima, Sahar; Sunesara, Shaleen; Masud, Faisal; Ratnani, Iqbal ","INTRODUCTION: During COVID-19, the surges in cases can be attributed to the lack of safety precautions. Health officials highly recommend use of face masks as a form of protection to curb the spread of the virus. Younger people may have less tendency to wear masks but did this attitude change if they knew someone affected with COVID-19? METHODS: We send an e-survey in the community regarding how mask habits have changed between early months of COVID-19 and now. These participants answered dichotomous questions about wearing a mask outside during the beginning of the pandemic, wearing a mask outside now, and whether anyone they know had been affected by the virus. They were also grouped in age categories that were 25 and under or above 25. Referencing the participant's age and their acquaintance's exposure to COVID-19, we used this data to determine the change in prevalence of wearing masks throughout the studied time period. RESULT(S): We received 310 responses. Responders were divided into 2 groups i.e., Younger Group (YG) <= 25 (n=123) and Older Group (OG) > 25 (n=187). At the start of the pandemic (around 1st week of March), the YG and OG start wearing masks with a frequency of 52% (64/123) and 63.1% (118/187). After 12 weeks, this frequency increased to 82.1% (101/123) and 95.1% (178/187) respectively. Although the trend appears higher in the older group, it was statistically not significant (p=0.8) when Fischer exact 2x2 test is applied due to sampling size < 1000. When a variable of a loved one or an acquaintance known to have COVID-19 is applied, both groups behaved differently with a frequency of 53.46% (n= 54 vs 47 /101) & 76.96% (n= 137 vs 41 /178). With chi2 contingency table further analyzing 8 subgroups with dependent of COVID-19 news exposure, the chi2 statistic was 45.47 with a p-value < 0.00001 (significant at p < .05 with two-tailed analysis). CONCLUSION(S): Masks were adopted largely across the population as the pandemic got worse. Younger group still stayed below older group. This behavior gets reinforced in older group but didn't affect the younger group with news of someone known to be COVID positive. This needs to be further investigated as due to their possible asymptomatic carrier state accompanied by low interest may result in a higher spread rate, with more burden on healthcare and ICUs.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,43,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000726360.68945.08,634767137,#101663,Khan 2021,,,0,0.756099823
6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes in 236379 survivors of COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records,"Taquet, Maxime; Geddes, John R; Harrison, Paul J; Husain, Masud; Luciano, Sierra ","Background: Neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have been reported, but more data are needed to adequately assess the effects of COVID-19 on brain health. We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Method(s): For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. Finding(s): Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33.62% (95% CI 33.17-34.07), with 12.84% (12.36-13.33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46.42% (44.78-48.09) and for a first diagnosis was 25.79% (23.50-28.25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0.56% (0.50-0.63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2.10% (1.97-2.23) for ischaemic stroke, 0.11% (0.08-0.14) for parkinsonism, 0.67% (0.59-0.75) for dementia, 17.39% (17.04-17.74) for anxiety disorder, and 1.40% (1.30-1.51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2.66% (2.24-3.16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6.92% (6.17-7.76) for ischaemic stroke, 0.26% (0.15-0.45) for parkinsonism, 1.74% (1.31-2.30) for dementia, 19.15% (17.90-20.48) for anxiety disorder, and 2.77% (2.31-3.33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1.44, 95% CI 1.40-1.47, for any diagnosis; 1.78, 1.68-1.89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1.16, 1.14-1.17, for any diagnosis; 1.32, 1.27-1.36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1.58, 1.50-1.67, for any diagnosis; 2.87, 2.45-3.35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. Interpretation(s): Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

Economic stressors and mental health symptoms among Bangladeshi rehabilitation professionals: A cross-sectional study amid COVID-19 pandemic.,"Ali, Mohammad; Uddin, Zakir; Hossain, Ahmed","Background: Mental health symptoms are considered a public health concern by many professionals and are frequently impacted by factors related to occupation, employment opportunities, and economic stressors. This study investigated the relationship between economic stressors and mental health symptoms among Bangladeshi rehabilitation professionals., Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 420 rehabilitation professionals between July 2020 and October 2020. Economic stressors were measured using Economic Hardship Questionnaire, Financial Threat Scale, and Financial Well-Being Scale. Mental health symptoms were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to find associated factors on mental health problems after adjusting confounders., Results: Among 420 rehabilitation professionals 62.1% were male, 38.6% were post-graduated and 75% were in practice. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 51.0%, 58.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The multivariable regression analysis indicated that without a high professional degree, lack of opportunity to practice, and loss of income were the associated factors for mental health symptoms. The modelling of the structural equation showed that financial threat is significantly associated with mental health symptoms., Conclusion: During the era of COVID-19, a high prevalence of mental health symptoms was observed among rehabilitation professionals. To minimize the burden of mental health, we recommend that all rehabilitation organizations and the government come together to create equal opportunities to practice and enable individuals to obtain high professional degrees.

Prevalence and associated factors of intention of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers in China: application of the Health Belief Model.,"Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph T F; She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Chen, Xiaojun","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and warrant COVID-19 vaccination to reduce nosocomial infections. This study investigated: (1) the prevalence of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV) under eight scenarios combining vaccines' effectiveness/safety/cost, plus two general scenarios of free/self-paid vaccination given governmental/hospital recommendations, (2) perceptions involving preferred timing of COVID-19 vaccination and impacts of various attributes on BICV, and (3) factors of BICV based on the Health Belief Model. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to <50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines' performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes.

A diagnosis of Guillain Barre syndrome was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroneurography (ENG). In all of them therapeutic approach included the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 gr/kg for 5 days), which resulted in the improvement of neurological symptoms. Clinical neurophysiology revealed the presence of conduction block, absence of F waves, and in two cases significant decrease in amplitude of compound motor action potential cMAP. Due to the potential role of inflammation on symptoms development and prognosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) levels were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase, while only serum was tested after recovery. Both IL-6 and IL-8 were found increased during the acute phase, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas four months after admission (at complete recovery), only IL-8 remained elevated in serum. These results confirm the inflammatory response that might be linked to peripheral nervous system complications, and encourage the use of IL-6 and IL-8 as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19.

Application of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to modulate inflammation in critical COVID-19 - A theoretical perspective.,"Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Ambia, Ayesha Rahman; Elgazzar, Tasnim Atef; AlSaud, Maha Bint Mishari; Kashir, Junaid","COVID-19 is an airway disease that has affected ~125 million people worldwide, caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), spread through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and aerosol transmission. Although most patients presenting with absent or mild symptoms recover completely, the highest morbidity and mortality rates are seen in the elderly, and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immunosuppressive diseases, diabetes, and pre-existing respiratory illnesses. Several therapeutic strategies have been examined, but a wide-ranging therapeutic option for particularly severe cases of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. Considering the indications presented by COVID-19 patients who present similarly with inflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been examined as a possible route to reduce proinflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP and ferritin by reducing inflammation, based on its anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by utilisation of IVIG for numerous other inflammatory conditions. Herein, summarising the recent key clinical evaluations of IVIG administration, we present our hypothesis that administration of IVIG within a specific dosage would be extremely beneficial towards reducing mortality and perhaps even the length of hospitalisation of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 symptoms.

Effectiveness of potential antiviral treatments in COVID-19 transmission control: a modelling study.,"Lin, Sheng-Nan; Rui, Jia; Chen, Qiu-Ping; Zhao, Bin; Yu, Shan-Shan; Li, Zhuo-Yang; Zhao, Ze-Yu; Wang, Yao; Zhu, Yuan-Zhao; Xu, Jing-Wen; Yang, Meng; Liu, Xing-Chun; Yang, Tian-Long; Luo, Li; Deng, Bin; Huang, Jie-Feng; Liu, Chan; Li, Pei-Hua; Liu, Wei-Kang; Xie, Fang; Chen, Yong; Su, Yan-Hua; Zhao, Ben-Hua; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Chen, Tian-Mu","BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense disease burden. Although public health countermeasures effectively controlled the epidemic in China, non-pharmaceutical interventions can neither be maintained indefinitely nor conveniently implemented globally. Vaccination is mainly used to prevent COVID-19, and most current antiviral treatment evaluations focus on clinical efficacy. Therefore, we conducted population-based simulations to assess antiviral treatment effectiveness among different age groups based on its clinical efficacy., METHODS: We collected COVID-19 data of Wuhan City from published literature and established a database (from 2 December 2019 to 16 March 2020). We developed an age-specific model to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19. Efficacy was divided into three types: (1) viral activity reduction, reflected as transmission rate decrease [reduction was set as v (0-0.8) to simulate hypothetical antiviral treatments]; (2) reduction in the duration time from symptom onset to patient recovery/removal, reflected as a 1/gamma decrease (reduction was set as 1-3 days to simulate hypothetical or real-life antiviral treatments, and the time of asymptomatic was reduced by the same proportion); (3) fatality rate reduction in severely ill patients (fc) [reduction (z) was set as 0.3 to simulate real-life antiviral treatments]. The population was divided into four age groups (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4), which included those aged <= 14; 15-44; 45-64; and >= 65 years, respectively. Evaluation indices were based on outbreak duration, cumulative number of cases, total attack rate (TAR), peak date, number of peak cases, and case fatality rate (f)., RESULTS: Comparing the simulation results of combination and single medication therapy s, all four age groups showed better results with combination medication. When 1/gamma = 2 and v = 0.4, age group 2 had the highest TAR reduction rate (98.48%, 56.01-0.85%). When 1/gamma = 2, z = 0.3, and v = 0.1, age group 1 had the highest reduction rate of f (83.08%, 0.71-0.12%)., CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatments are more effective in COVID-19 transmission control than in mortality reduction. Overall, antiviral treatments were more effective in younger age groups, while older age groups showed higher COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to prevention of viral spread and patients deaths when providing antiviral treatments to patients of older age groups.",2021,/,Infectious diseases of poverty,10,1,53,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00835-2,33874998,#101362,Lin 2021,,,0,0.151147473
Impact of COVID-19 on serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters in children.,"Yayici Koken, Ozlem; Gultutan, Pembe; Gungoren, Merve Sibel; Bayhan, Gulsum Iclal; Yilmaz, Deniz; Gurkas, Esra; Ozyurek, Hamit; Citak Kurt, Aysegul Nese","BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to analyze the serum melatonin levels and changes in sleep patterns in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns., RESULTS: The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of 6 subcategories of the SDSC questionnaire regarding the present time and six months before symptom onset. The total SDSC scores were also similar in two different evaluation time points described above (p=0.99)., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that COVID-19 did not impact the sleep parameters of children. Serum melatonin levels of all patients were higher than the reference range; however, they were higher in the non-COVID-19 patient group than the COVID-19 group. Since serum melatonin levels were higher than the reference values in children with COVID-19, and this disease is significantly less morbid in children, melatonin may have protective effects against COVID-19.",2021,/,Turkish journal of medical sciences,,9441758,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3906/sag-2012-361,33843171,#98014,YayiciKoken 2021,,,0,0.054271928
Clinical characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kuwait,"Alsharrah, Danah; Alhaddad, Fatemah; Aljamaan, Sarah; Ayed, Mariam; Alyaseen, Munirah; Almutairi, Nahar; Papenburg, Jesse; Alghounaim, Mohammad ","Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe and life-threatening. National-level registries found that children, generally, have less severe disease when compared with adults. However, most asymptomatically infected children will not present to hospital and may be missed. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, and to estimate the potential duration of viral shedding. A retrospective cohort study was performed in Jaber Alahmad Hospital (JAH) from February 29 to April 30, 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures, all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients from 1 month to 18 years old, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at JAH, and were included. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity was defined as having two consecutive negative PCR results from a respiratory specimen. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed. We found that 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%-75.3%) of 134 SARS-CoV-2-infected children were asymptomatic. Median PCR positivity was 15 days and did not vary with symptoms. Among patients who had laboratory investigations and chest imaging, symptomatic infection was associated with elevated C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, and radiographic pneumonia. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is very common in children. Among symptomatic patients, the disease seems to be mild. Children exhibit substantial duration of viral shedding, regardless of symptoms.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,5,3246-3250,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26684,2007475994,#98465,Alsharrah 2021,,,0,0.118951474
Dementia is an age-independent risk factor for severity and death in COVID-19 inpatients.,"Tahira, Ana C; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio; Ferreira, Sergio T","INTRODUCTION: Dementia has been associated with COVID-19 prevalence, but whether this reflects higher infection, older age of patients, or disease severity remains unclear., METHODS: We investigated a cohort of 12,863 UK Biobank community-dwelling individuals > 65 years old (1814 individuals >= 80 years old) tested for COVID-19. Individuals were stratified by age to account for age as a confounder. Risk factors were analyzed for COVID-19-positive diagnosis, hospitalization, and death., RESULTS: All-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) were associated with COVID-19-positive diagnosis, and all-cause dementia and AD remained associated in individuals >= 80 years old. All-cause dementia, AD, or PD were not risk factors for overall hospitalization, but increased the risk of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. All-cause dementia and AD increased the risk of COVID-19-related death, and all-cause dementia was uniquely associated with increased death in >= 80-year-old patients., DISCUSSION: All-cause dementia and AD are age-independent risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19.

COVID-19 in a lung transplant recipient: Exploring the diagnostic role of circulating exosomes and the clinical impact of advanced immunosuppression,"Goodlet, Kellie J.; Bansal, Sandhya; Arjuna, Ashwini; Buddhdev, Bhuvin; Abdelrazek, Hesham; Mohamed, Hesham; Omar, Ashraf; Walia, Rajat; Mohanakumar, Thalachallour; Tokman, Sofya; Nailor, Michael D. ","Exosomes isolated from plasma of lung transplant recipients with allograft injury contain donor-derived lung self-antigens (collagen V and Kalpha1 tubulin) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We present a case of a 76-year-old, female lung transplant recipient treated for acute cellular rejection with methylprednisolone and anti-thymocyte globulin, who subsequently contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed a sharp increase in the mean fluorescent intensity of anti-HLA antibodies. Analysis of circulating exosomes during rejection, but before SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealed the presence of lung self-antigens and HLA class II molecules. After the patient contracted SARS-CoV-2, exosomes with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were also found. After resolution of infectious symptoms, exosomes with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were no longer detected; however, exosomes with lung self-antigens and HLA class II molecules persisted, which coincided with a progressive decline in spirometric flows, suggesting chronic lung allograft dysfunction. We propose that the analysis of circulating exosomes may be used to detect allograft injury mediated by both rejection and infection. Furthermore, the detection of exosomes containing viral proteins may be helpful in identifying allograft injury driven by viral pathogens.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Transplant Infectious Disease,23,2,e13480,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tid.13480,2006947550,#104397,Goodlet 2021,,,0,0.80532936
Herpes zoster following BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases: a case series.,"Furer, Victoria; Zisman, Devy; Kibari, Adi; Rimar, Doron; Paran, Yael; Elkayam, Ori","OBJECTIVES: As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD., METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel., RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 +/- 11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects., CONCLUSION: Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster.

"COVID-19 Management in Clinical Dental Care. Part I: Epidemiology, Public Health Implications, and Risk Assessment.","Melo, Paulo; Barbosa, Joao Malta; Jardim, Luis; Carrilho, Eunice; Portugal, Jaime","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral disease declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, has posed great changes to many sectors of society across the globe. Its virulence and rapid dissemination have forced the adoption of strict public health measures in most countries, which, collaterally, resulted in economic hardship. This article is the first in a series of 3 that aims to contextualise the clinical impact of COVID-19 for the dental profession. It presents the epidemiological conditions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), namely, its modes of transmission, incubation, and transmissibility period, signs and symptoms, immunity, immunological tests, and risk management in dental care. Individuals in dental care settings are exposed to 3 potential sources of contamination with COVID-19: close interpersonal contacts (<1 m), contact with saliva, and aerosol-generating dental procedures. Thus, a risk management model is propsoed for the provision of dental care depending on the epidemiological setting, the patient's characteristics, and the type of procedures performed in the office environment. Although herd immunity seems difficult to achieve, a significant number of people has been infected throughout the first 9 months of the pandemic and vaccination has been implemented, which means that there will be a growing number of presumable ""immune"" individuals that might not require many precautions that differ from those before COVID-19. In conclusion, dental care professionals may manage their risk by following the proposed model, which considers the recommendations by local and international health authorities, thus providing a safe environment for both professionals and patients.

Serum ferritin predicts need for vasopressor support and acute kidney injury during severe COVID-19,"Ruiz, Arnaldo Lopez; Cearras, Martin; El Maali, Cheikh Ethmane Abou; Oliveira, Eduardo; Khan, Abdul ","INTRODUCTION: Severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the most common cause of ARDS in 2020. This infection is associated with systemic inflammation, need for vasopressor support and AKI. Serum ferritin (Ft) is an immunomodulator-antioxidant protein consistently elevated in COVID-19 that may confer protection or accentuate the progression of the disease depending on its level. We evaluated if Hyperferritinemia (Ft >2000 ng/ml) induced by COVID-19 is independently associated with need for vasopressor support and development of AKI in patients with ARDS. METHOD(S): Retrospective Cases-Control study that included patients with moderate ARDS secondary to COVID-19 admitted to ICU. Patients were categorized based on Ft as Cases [Cs] (Ft >2000 ng/ml) and Controls [Ct] (Ft <2000 ng/ml). The following outcomes were evaluated during the first 10 days of ICU stay: a) need for vasopressor support >=3mug/min for >=24h and b) development of AKI stage 2 or 3 (KDIGO) with no evidence of recovery. Groups were matched based on age, SOFA, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Data was analyzed using relative risk (RR), absolute risk increase (ARI), Pearson correlation and paired t-test. RESULT(S): The study enrolled 60 patients (n=30/group). All patients had ARDS (PO2/FIO2 100-200) requiring mechanical ventilation. Most patients were males (Cs:53%, Ct:63%). Both groups had similar age (Cs: 59.4 vs Ct:58.6) and similar baseline variables: SOFA (Cs: 4.3 vs Ct: 4.1), CCI (Cs: 2.7 vs Ct: 2.6) and CRP (Cs: 106.6 vs Ct: 96.1 mg/L). During the study, 67% of the Cs (Ft >2000 ng/ml) required vasopressor support compared to 36% of the Ct (Ft <2000 ng/ml) [RR:1.87, 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.3, p<0.02]. Similarly, 60% of the Cs developed AKI compared to 30% of the Ct [RR:1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.1, p <0.02]. No correlation between Ft and CRP was found in both groups. Cs (Ft > 2000 ng/ml) had an ARI of 31% for vasopressor support and ARI of 30% for progression to AKI. CONCLUSION(S): Our study suggest that hyperferritinemia (>2000 ng/ml) due to severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with need for vasopressor support and progression to AKI within the first 10 days of ICU admission. However, the potential cytoprotective and immunomodulatory role of moderate elevation of Ft (<2000 ng/ml) deserves further investigation.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,145,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000727152.57243.40,634767159,#101669,Ruiz 2021,,,0,0.391036646
Remote Fingerstick Blood Collection for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibody Testing,"Kirkpatrick, Grace; Nixon, Andrea; Astudillo, Michael G.; Yang, Diane; Dighe, Anand S.; Lennerz, Jochen; Thierauf, Julia; Iafrate, A John; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Miller, Tyler E.; Mahanta, Lisa M.; Murali, Mandakolathur; Naranbhai, Vivek ","The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has propelled the rapid development of serologic tests that can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These have been used for studying the prevalence and spread of infection in different populations, and helping establish a recent diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and will likely be used to confirm humoral immunity after infection or vaccination. However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we present a method that enables large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serologic studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with a volumetric absorptive microsampling device (Mitra, Neoteryx LLC) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics Inc) that is emergency use authorization approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type. Overall, this study affirms the use of Mitra dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies.Copyright Â© 2021 College of American Pathologists.",2021,/,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,145,4,415-418,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0713-SA,633587055,#96859,Kirkpatrick 2021,Exclusion reason: No study end date; ,,0,0.968081577

Dental students and dental professionals are at a higher risk because dental practice comprises close communication and widespread exposure to blood, saliva, and other body fluids. It is imperative to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19) among budding dentists. Aim: To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of dental students regarding dental practices during COVID-19. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among undergraduate students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire consisting of demographic, knowledge, and attitude-based questions were circulated among the study population, and the responses for the knowledge and attitude were scored. Their mean scores were then calculated. Chi-square test and nonparametric tests were computed using SPSS version 21 software, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: 388 undergraduate dental students have participated in the study from Saudi Arabia. 68% of the respondents believed that they had sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19. The mean score for knowledge was 5.84 out of 7. Females (6.24) scored statistically significantly higher than males (5.55, p < = 0.001). The mean attitude score was 6.34 out of 9. 93% were using PPE models, while 95% maintained social distancing. Out of all the participating dental students, only 16% were willing to treat patients during the pandemic, and 28% did not want to treat patients, 28% preferred teledentistry. The majority (44%) of dental undergraduates were willing to handle only emergency cases. Conclusion:  Accurate knowledge and attitude regarding COVID-19 and diversified opinion on preventive practices during the pandemic period among budding dental professionals evident from Saudi Arabia.

"COVID19 OUTBREAK IN LOMBARDY, ITALY: AN ANALYSIS ON THE SHORT-TERM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION, CLIMATIC FACTORS AND THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION.","Stufano, Angela; Lisco, Stefania; Bartolomeo, Nicola; Marsico, Antonella; Lucchese, Guglielmo; Jahantigh, Hamidreza; Soleo, Leonardo; Moretti, Massimo; Trerotoli, Paolo; De Palma, Giuseppe; Lovreglio, Piero","Short-term exposure to air pollution, as well as to climate variables have been linked to a higher incidence of respiratory viral diseases. The study aims to assess the short-term influence of air pollution and climate on COVID19 incidence in Lombardy (Italy), during the early stage of the outbreak, before the implementation of the lock-down measures. The daily number of COVID19 cases in Lombardy from February 25th to March 10th 2020, and the daily average concentrations up to 15 days before the study period of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), O3, SO2, and NO2 together with climate variables (temperature, relative humidity - RH%, wind speed, precipitation), were analyzed. A univariable mixed model with a logarithm transformation as link function was applied for each day, from 15 days (lag15) to one day (lag1) before the day of detected cases, to evaluate the effect of each variable. Additionally, change points (Break Points-BP) in the relationship between incident cases and air pollution or climatic factors were estimated. The results did not show a univocal relationship between air quality or climate factors and COVID19 incidence. PM10, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the last lags seem to be related to an increased COVID19 incidence, probably due to an increased susceptibility of the host. In addition, low temperature and low wind speed in some lags resulted associated with increased daily COVID19 incidence. The findings observed suggest that these factors, in particular conditions and lags, may increase individual susceptibility to the development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of add-on semi-individualized CM during the outbreak. A retrospective cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from 2235 consecutive linked records retrieved from five hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups, and the frequency of CMs used was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semi-individualized CM user group and 17.0% among the non-users. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77, p = 0.005) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76, p = 0.009) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients that received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality, especially among severe/critical cases. Chinese medicine could be considered as an add-on regimen for trial use.Copyright Â© 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2021,/,American Journal of Chinese Medicine,49,3,543-575,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0192415X21500257,634446126,#98923,Shu 2021,,,0,0.065434524
