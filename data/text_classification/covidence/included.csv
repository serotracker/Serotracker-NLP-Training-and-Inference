"High Rates of SARS-CoV-2 Family Transmission in Children of Healthcare Workers During the First Pandemic Wave in Madrid, Spain: Serologic Study.","Mendez-Echevarria, Ana; Sainz, Talia; de Felipe, Beatriz; Alcolea, Sonia; Olbrich, Peter; Goycochea-Valdivia, Walter A; Escosa-Garcia, Luis; Cobo, Lorena; Calvo, Cristina; Neth, Olaf","BACKGROUND: Data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children living with healthcare workers (HCWs) are scarce., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary Hospital in Madrid, including children of HCW who suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. Children underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological study for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VIRCELL IgG assay., RESULTS: One hundred thirteen children from 69 HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited: 47 children had positive IgG (41.6%). Children secondary attack rate was 43.7% (25% if both parents have had asymptomatic infection; 39.5% if one parent was symptomatic; and 47% when both parents had symptoms). Having a positive sibling was associated with a positive IgG result (odds ratio = 12.2; 95% confidence interval: 4.4-33.7, P < 0.001). Median age was higher in IgG positive children (P = 0.022). Children who referred anosmia presented higher IgG titles (P < 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed a very high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children of HCW during the first pandemic wave, especially when both parents were symptomatic. Having a positive sibling was associated with seroconversion, supporting the important role of family clusters in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Serological Profile of Children and Young Adults with at Least One SARS-CoV-2 Positive Cohabitant: An Observational Study.,"Farronato, Marco; Dolci, Carolina; Boccalari, Elisa; Izadi, Sara; Salvatierra Rios, Luis Hernan; Festa, Maurizio; Panetta, Valentina; De Vito, Danila; Tartaglia, Gianluca Martino","At the end of 2019, a new disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan Province in China. Children seemed to be infected less frequently than adults, and family clusters seemed to play an important role in the spread of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the serological profile of children and young adults between 4 and 16 years of age in order to assess the transmission patterns of COVID-19 between cohabitants. The subjects lived with at least one cohabitant who tested positive for the disease using a nasopharyngeal swab. To avoid contact with the disease, families were interviewed by telephone. Forty-nine children and adolescents with a mean age of 11 years were then subjected to a rapid lateral flow chromatographic test. Of them, seven (14.3%) were immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive, and four (8.2%) were immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive. In total, 16.3% of the tested sample had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: this may confirm the lower vulnerability of children to COVID-19, despite the small sample size.

Corona in Children: the Co-Ki Study: Relevance of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient pediatric services in Germany,Schwarz S.; Jenetzky E.; Krafft H.; Maurer T.; Steuber C.; Reckert T.; Fischbach T.; Martin D. ,"Background: In Germany over 80% of children and adolescents are in the ambulatory care of registered pediatricians. These have a specific perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): For this reason, this professional group initiated a central recording of case numbers, individual case descriptions and observations on infections and illnesses with SARS-CoV-2 (www.co-ki.de). Result(s): So far 557 pediatricians have participated. Together they care for ca. 670,000 children. They reported 9803 children who presented as suspected cases. The pediatricians themselves had a clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 3654 children. In 7707 children PCR tests were carried out using nose/throat swabs of which 198 (2.6%) were positive. In addition, 731 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with detection in 82 cases (11.2%). Despite initially positive PCR tests, 47 children had a negative antibody test at least 2 weeks later. Our query as to infections of adults by children yielded only one case, which a telephone enquiry revealed as unlikely. Discussion(s): From an outpatient pediatric perspective COVID-19 is rare. There was no convincing evidence that children are a relevant source of infection for SARS-CoV-2 nor that they are relevantly at risk.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",2021,/,Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde,169,1,39-45,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00112-020-01050-3,2007150045,#80472,Schwarz 2021,"",""

After adjusting for potential confounders, seroprevalence was also associated with Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.98, p=0.001) and African-American race (OR 2.02, p=0.027) as well as contact with a COVID-19-diagnosed individual in the household (OR 5.73, p<0.001) or clinical work setting (OR 1.76, p=0.002). Importantly, African-American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal COVID-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societal factors., CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modelling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to COVID-19.

"Seroepidemiological Survey of the Antibody for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 with Neutralizing Activity at Hospitals: A Cross-sectional Study in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan.","Furukawa, Koichi; Arii, Jun; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Tjan, Lidya Handayani; Lystia Poetranto, Anna; Ren, Zhenxiao; Aktar, Salma; Huang, Jing Rin; Sutandhio, Silvia; Kurahashi, Yukiya; Nishino, Arisa; Shigekuni, Shiho; Takeda, Yuichiro; Uto, Kenichi; Matsui, Keiji; Sato, Itsuko; Inui, Yoshiaki; Endo, Kazuo; Kosaka, Yoshiyuki; Oota, Toshiaki; Saegusa, Jun; Mori, Yasuko","Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading rapidly all over the world. The Japanese government lifted the state of emergency, announced in April 2020, on May 25, but there are still sporadic clusters. Asymptomatic patients who can transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause some of these clusters. It is thus urgent to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and their neutralizing activity. We conducted a cross-sectional study of >10,000 samples at hospitals in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan., Methods: Between August 6 and October 1, 2020, we collected samples of residual blood from the patients who visited or were admitted to five hospitals and a foundation in Hyogo. We tested the samples for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Sera that were positive by ECLIA or CLEIA were analyzed by an immunochromatographic (IC) test and neutralizing activity assay., Results: We tested 10,377 samples from patients aged between 0 and 99 years old; 27 cases (0.26%) were positive on the ECLIA, and 51 cases (0.49%) were positive on CLEIA. In the 14 cases that tested positive on both ECLIA and CLEIA, the positive rates on the IC test and for neutralizing activity were high (85% and 92%, respectively). In 50 cases (0.48%) that were positive by either ECLIA or CLEIA, the corresponding rates were low (20% and 6%, respectively). The positive rate of neutralizing antibody was 0.15%., Conclusions: These results indicate that most Hyogo Prefecture residents still do not have antibodies and should avoid the risk of incurring a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two or more antibody tests should be required for seroepidemiological studies of the antibody for SARS-CoV-2, and a neutralizing activity assay is also essential.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a University Community: A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Student Return to Campus on Infection Risk Among Community Members,"Arnold, Callum; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Herzog, Catherine; Gontu, Abhinay; Bharti, Nita; Small, Meg; Rogers, Connie; Schade, Margeaux; Kuchipudi, Suresh; Kapur, Vivek; Andrew, Read; Ferrari, Matthew","<h4>Background: </h4> Returning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term. Findings Of 345 community participants, 19 (5.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8.1%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20-50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3.24, 2.14-4.91; 1.62, 1.08-2.44; respectively). Interpretation Despite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.

To understand the herd immunity after the COVID-19 pandemic, the seroprevalence was measured in 3062 individuals with or without COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> The levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgM and IgG were measured by the immuno-colloidal gold method. <h4>Results: </h4>: The mean seroprevalence for IgM and IgG in all participants was 2.81% and 7.51%, respectively. The positive rate of IgG was significantly higher in women than in men (P<0.05). The highest positive rate of IgM was observed in 41-60 years of age (3.49%), while the highest seroprevalence for IgG was observed in persons >60 years of age (8.61%). The positive rates of IgM and IgG in the convalescent patients were 31.82% and 77.27%, respectively, which was significantly higher than individuals with suspected syndromes or individuals without any clinical signs (P<0.01). Seroprevalence for IgG in medical staff was markedly higher than those in residents. The seroprevalence in patients with various comorbidity was no significant difference (P>0.05). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The low positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and NA test indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is subsiding after three months, and the possibility of reintroduction of the virus from an unidentified natural reservoir is low.

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. Objective(s): To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Result(s): The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. Conclusion(s): At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens.

SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroprevalence Among Maintenance Dialysis Patients in the United States.,"Walker, Adam G; Sibbel, Scott; Wade, Curtis; Moulton, Nick; Marlowe, Gilbert; Young, Amy; Fadem, Stephen Z; Brunelli, Steven M","Rationale & Objective: Reported COVID-19 cases underestimate the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients receiving maintenance dialysis are at high risk for COVID-19, and higher case rates have been reported relative to the general population. To better understand infection patterns, we performed a seroprevalence study among maintenance dialysis patients at a large dialysis organization in the United States., Study Design: Cross-sectional., Setting & Participants: We measured IgG antibodies in an IRB-approved study of remnant serum samples collected for routine laboratory screenings in a national sample of 12,932 maintenance dialysis patients (27 May-01 Jul 2020)., Exposure: State, sex, age, and race., Outcomes: Seropositivity; ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 case rate., Analytic Approach: Seropositivity was calculated overall and by state, sex, age, and race. Ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was calculated overall and by state., Results: Overall, 747 (5.8%) of samples were seropositive. Seroprevalence varied by state and was lowest in Kentucky (1.0%) but highest in New York (23.6%). Seroprevalence was similar among men and women. Among samples from patients < 70 years, 6.0%-6.5% were seropositive; whereas 5.2% and 3.9% of samples from patients 70-79 and >= 80 years, respectively, were seropositive. Samples from Black and Hispanic patients were 7.3% and 7.7% positive, respectively, compared to 2.8% of samples from White patients. After adjustment, risk differences among racial groups were lower, but not eliminated. During the study period, the known COVID-19 case rate was 3.3%. The ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was 1.7., Limitations: Imperfect assay sensitivity; results represent infections occurring before July 2020; deidentification prevented comparison of antibodies to previous COVID-19 status for individual patients; may not generalize to patients dialyzing with other providers or in other countries., Conclusions: Seroprevalence was 5.8% among dialysis patients as of 01 July 2020. This indicates the actual number of infections was 1.7-times greater than reported cases. This ratio is lower than reported in the general population, suggesting there were fewer unknown infections among maintenance dialysis patients.

"Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Free State provinces of South Africa in January 2021","Sykes, Wendy; Mhlanga, Laurette; Swanevelder, Ronel; Glatt, Tanya Nadia; Grebe, Eduard; Coleman, Charl; Pieterson, Nadia; Cable, Russell; Welte, Alex; Berg, Karin van den; Vermeulen, Marion","<h4>Background: </h4> Population-level estimates of prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity (seroprevalence) is a crucial epidemiological indicator for tracking the Covid-19 epidemic. Such data are in short supply, both internationally and in South Africa. The South African blood services (the South African National Blood Service, SANBS and the Western Cape Blood Service, WCBS) are coordinating a nationally representative survey of blood donors, which it is hoped can become a cost-effective surveillance method with validity for community-level seroprevalence estimation. <h4>Methods: </h4> Leveraging existing arrangements, SANBS human research ethics committee permission was obtained to test blood donations collected on predefined days (7th, 10th ,12th ,15th ,20th ,23th and 25th January) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas e411 platform currently available in the blood services’ donation testing laboratories. Using standard methods, prevalence analysis was done by province, age and race, allowing age to be regarded as either a continuous or categorical variable. Testing was performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces. <h4>Results: </h4>: We report on data from 4858 donors - 1457 in EC; 463 in NC; 831 in FS and 2107 in ZN. Prevalence varied substantially across race groups and between provinces, with seroprevalence among Black donors consistently several times higher than among White donors, and the other main population groups (Coloured and Asian) not consistently represented in all provinces. There is no clear evidence that seroprevalence among donors varies by age. Weighted net estimates of prevalence (in the core age range 15-69) by province (compared with official clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case rates in mid-January 2021) are: EC-63%(2.8%), NC-32%(2.2%), FS-46%(2.4%), and ZN-52%(2.4%). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Our study demonstrates substantial differences in dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection between different race groups, most likely explained by historically based differences in socio-economic status and housing conditions. As has been seen in other areas, even such high seroprevalence does not guarantee population-level immunity against new outbreaks – probably due to viral evolution and waning of antibody neutralization. Despite its limitations, notably a ‘healthy donor’ effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.",2021,,,,,,PPR282601,10.21203/rs.3.rs-233375/v1,,#80681,Sykes 2021,"",""

To assess evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and adolescents in Mississippi, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was conducted on a convenience sample of residual serum specimens collected for routine laboratory testing by an academic medical center laboratory during May 17 through September 19, 2020. Seroprevalence by calendar month was standardized to the state population by race/ethnicity; cumulative numbers of infections were estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to all those aged <18 years in Mississippi. Serum specimens from 1,603 individuals were tested; 175 (10.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 1,579 (98.5%) individuals for whom race/ethnicity was known, the number testing positive was 16 (23.2%) of 69 Hispanic individuals, 117 (13.0%) of 901 non-Hispanic Black individuals and 30 (5.3%) of 565 non-Hispanic White individuals. Population-weighted seroprevalence estimates among those aged <18 years increased from 2.6% in May to 16.9% in September 2020. Cumulative numbers of infections extrapolated from seroprevalence data, however, were estimated at 117,805 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68,771–168,708), suggesting that cases in children and adolescents are much higher than what was reported to the Mississippi State Department of Health (9,044 cases during this period).

Seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers in a pediatric monographic hospital in Madrid (Spain).,"Escribano Ceruelo, Eva; Espinel Ruiz, Marco Antonio; Ortega Lopez-Pelaez, Marta; Fernandez Garoz, Barbara; Asensio Anton, Julia; Jimenez Garcia, Raquel","INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, 203.715 SARS-CoV-2 infections had been reported in Spain, 54.486 in Madrid, 21.4% were health care workers. Our objective is to determine seroprevalence of COVID-19 among workers in a monographic pediatric hospital., METHODS: Between April13th and 30th, 1.523 health workers were recruited to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology screening (All Test R) and they answered a questionnaire with demographic, epidemiological and clinical information and previous exposure to COVID-19., FINDINGS: One thousand two hundred ninety two (84.8%) were tested. Positive serology (IgM and/or IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 was found in 17.2% (222/1.292), in 15.5% (201/1.292) if only IgG was considered. Median age was 44+/-13 years, 73% were female. The 33.8% (75/222) were asymptomatic. Eighty one had a previous positive rRT-PCR. The 14% (32/222) referred a family contact., CONCLUSION: Serology prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in workers of a pediatric hospital was higher than in general population.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Post-First Wave among Primary Care Physicians in Catania (Italy).,"Ledda, Caterina; Carrasi, Flavia; Longombardo, Maria Teresa; Paravizzini, Gianluca; Rapisarda, Venerando","Family physicians or pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) work in non-hospital settings. GPs usually visit many patients, frequently at their homes, with low potential, if any, to control the work setting. Particularly during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, they were not informed about the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with inadequate information regarding the risk, a lack of suitable protective measures and, in some cases, deficient or poor accessibility to personal protective equipment (PPE). During the first wave of COVID-19, primary care physicians were on the front line and isolated the first cases of the disease. The present study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 133 GPs working in Catania (Italy) after the first wave of COVID-19. Serological analysis revealed a low seroprevalence (3%) among GPs. The low seroprevalence highlighted in the results can be attributed to correct management of patients by GPs in the first wave.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural southwest community.,"Santarelli, Anthony; Lalitsasivimol, Diana; Bartholomew, Nate; Reid, Sasha; Reid, Joseph; Lyon, Chris; Wells, James; Ashurst, John","Context: The true prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been difficult to determine due to limited testing, inconsistent symptom severity, and asymptomatic infections. Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population., Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community., Methods: A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing., Results: A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest.

This surveillance activity was established as part of the National Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan. METHOD(S): Participants (n = 3037) were recruited from 11 public and private hospitals in four states (NSW, Vic, SA and WA) between 2 June and 17 July 2020, with an overall 66% participation rate. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was assessed by Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs taken after induction of anaesthesia. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed by analysis of serum collected at the same time using a novel dual-antigen ELISA assay. RESULT(S): No patient (0/3010) returned a positive RT-PCR result. The Bayesian estimated prevalence of active infection of 0.02% (95% probability interval 0.00-0.11%), with the upper endpoint being 1 in 918. Positive serology (IgG) was observed in 15 of 2991 patients, with a strong positive in five of those individuals (Bayesian estimated seroprevalence 0.16%; 95% probability interval 0.00-0.47%).

Modelling studies suggest that school closures contribute to community transmission reduction. However, data among school-attending students and staff are scarce. In November 2020, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany. <h4>Methods:</h4> Students and school staff were examined, oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members performed self-swabs. Individual and institutional infection prevention and control measures were assessed. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected household members were re-tested after one week. Findings: 1119 participants were examined, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff, and 625 household members. Participants reported mainly cold symptoms (19.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight of 24 classes affecting each 1-2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2.7% (95%CI, 1.2-5.0%; 9/338), 1.4% (0.2-5.1%; 2/140), and 2.3% (1.3-3.8%; 14/611) among students, staff and household members, respectively, including quarantined persons. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic. Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask use in school, way to school on foot, and case-contacts outside school. IgG antibodies were detected in 2.0% (0.8-4.1%; 7/347), 1.4% (0.2-5.0%; 2/141) and 1.4% (0.6-2.7%; 8/576), respectively. For three of nine households with infection(s) detected at cross-sectional assessment, origin in school seemed possible. After one week, no school-related, secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1.1%. Interpretation: These data suggest that school attendance under preventive measures is feasible, provided their rigorous implementation.

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. <h4>Methods: </h4> There were two parts to this study. Between 15 th March 2020 to 15 th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst PCR-negative patients were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. <h4>Results: </h4> In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining PCR-negative patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic, with 19 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. A separate six patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst as inpatient.

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India., METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys., FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29 082 individuals from 15 613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6.6% (95% CI 5.8-7.4). Among 15 084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7.1% (6.2-8.2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74.3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case., INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country., FUNDING: Indian Council of Medical Research. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance., Objective: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample., Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaWu study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany., Exposures: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay., Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic.",2021,/,JAMA pediatrics,,101589544,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0001,33480966,#75978,Tonshoff 2021,"",""

Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants. Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001). Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection.

The real burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in West Africa is not clearly defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in half of the 3,380 workers of several mining companies operating in two mines in the Ivory Coast and having its headquarters in the economic capital Abidjan. <h4>Methods:</h4> From 15th July to 13th October 2020, a voluntary serological test campaign was performed in the 3 sites where the companies operate: two mines, and the headquarters in Abidjan.We performed a COVID-PRESTO rapid test for the detection of IgG and IgM on capillary blood. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent sociodemographic characteristics associated with a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 1,687 subjects were tested. 91% were male (n= 1,536) and mean age was 37 years old. The overall crude seroprevalence rate was 25.1% (n=422), but differing significantly between different sites, rising from 13.6% (11.2%-16.1%) in mine A to 34.4% (31.1%-37.7%) in mine B and 34.7% (26.2%-43.2%) in Abidjan. Non-resident workers in mines had a significantly lower prevalence rate than those living full-time in mines. Seroprevalence was 26.5% in natives of the Ivory Coast, while people coming from countries other than Africa were less likely to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Among the 422 positive subjects, 74 reported mild symptoms in the three previous months and one was hospitalized for a severe COVID-19 infection. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among mine workers in Ivory Coast is high. The low morbidity observed has probably led to an underestimation of the burden of this infection in West Africa. The high prevalence reported in subjects living in Abidjan, who have not any close contact with mine workers, may be indicative of the real seroprevalence in the Ivory Coast capital.",2021,,,,,,PPR276157,10.1101/2021.01.27.21249186,,#77358,Milleliri 2021,"",""
Cross Sectional Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Health Care Workers in Paediatric Facilities in Eight Countries,Goldblatt D.; Johnson M.; Falup-Pecurariu O.; Ivaskeviciene I.; Spoulou V.; Tamm E.; Wagner M.; Zar H.J.; Bleotu L.; Ivaskevicius R.; Papadatou I.; Jogi P.; Lischka J.; Franckling-Smith Z.; Isarova D.; Grandjean L.; Zavadska D. ,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 which may in part be driven by nosocomial exposure. If HCW exposure is predominantly nosocomial, HCWs in paediatric facilities, where few patients are admitted with COVID-19, may lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and be at increased risk during the current resurgence. AIMS: To compare SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in paediatric facilities in seven European countries and South Africa (n=8). METHOD(S): All categories of paediatric HCWs were invited to participate in the study irrespective of previous symptoms. A single blood sample was taken and data about previous symptoms documented. Serum was shipped to a central laboratory in London where IgG to SARS-CoV-2 was measured. FINDINGS: 4114 HCWs were recruited between 1st May and mid-July 2020. The overall seroprevalence range was 0-16.93%. The highest seroprevalence was in London (16.93%) followed by that in Cape Town, South Africa (10.36%). There were no positive HCWs in the Austrian, Estonian and Latvian cohorts, 2/300 positive in Lithuania (0.66%, 0.18-2.4), 1/124 (0.81%, 0.14-4.3) in Romania, and 1/76 (1.3%, 0.23-7.0) in Greece. CONCLUSION(S): The overall seroprevalence amongst paediatric HCWs is similar to their national populations and linked to national COVID-19 burden. Staff working in paediatric facilities in low burden countries have very low rates of seroprevalence and thus are likely to be susceptible to COVID-19. Their susceptibility to infection may impact on the ability to provide care in the face of increasing COVID-19 disease and highlights the need for appropriate preventative strategies in paediatric health care settings.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies. <h4>Objective</h4> To expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels. <h4>Study Design</h4> The Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification. <h4>Results</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.",2021,,,,,,PPR277509,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250943,,#78588,Molenaar 2021,"",""

SUMMARY ANSWER: Nuchal translucency thickness at the first trimester scan was not significantly different in pregnant women with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnant women are more vulnerable to viral infections. Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1019 women with a double test taken between 17 February and 23 April 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between 14 April and 21 May 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving ~12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16) versus negative (n = 966) (P = 0.62). There was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, P = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning COVID-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies. Follow-up studies are needed to establish any risk to a fetus exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence and Clinical Features of COVID-19 in a German Liver Transplant Recipient Cohort: A Prospective Serosurvey Study,Rauber C.; Tiwari-Heckler S.; Pfeiffenberger J.; Mehrabi A.; Lund F.; Gath P.; Mieth M.; Merle U.; Rupp C. ,"Background: In liver transplant (LT) recipients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fatal outcome has been reported in a substantial subset of patients. Whether LT recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared with the general population is controversial. Here we report the results of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurvey in a large LT recipient cohort. Method(s): A total of 219 LT recipients were enrolled between May 5, 2020, and August 6, 2020, at the University Hospital Heidelberg. Serum blood samples were collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. Result(s): Taking into account known risk factors of arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or leukopenia, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101 of 219 (46.1%) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients, 8 (3.7%) either had a positive test result for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. Five of eight (62.5%) did not show any clinical signs of infection, three of eight (37.5%) had self-limited disease, and none required hospitalization for COVID-19. Two of eight (25%) had known exposure to infected health care staff as the probable source of infection. Conclusion(s): In summary, LT recipients showed a SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate similar to that of the general population with a substantial percentage of unrecognized infections.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,Transplantation Proceedings,,"(Rauber, Tiwari-Heckler, Pfeiffenberger, Merle, Rupp) Department for Gastroenterology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany(Mehrabi, Mieth) Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hosp",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.11.009,2010643112,#76448,Rauber 2021,"",""

Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the United States was performed. <h4>Methods:</h4> Children and adolescents ≤ 19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, United States. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens. <h4>Results:</h4> In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Orthogonal antibody testing with a receptor binding domain specific antigen revealed a high concordance of 80.5%. Children also demonstrated a robust immune response to the nucleocapsid antigen. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported. This was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection.

Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed fortnightly questionnaires on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive or prior PCR/antibody test positive) or negative cohort (antibody negative, not previously known to be PCR/antibody positive). Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, possible (subdivided by symptom-status)) depending on hierarchy of evidence. Individuals in the primary infection were excluded from this analysis if infection was confirmed by antibody only. Reinfection rates in the positive cohort were compared against new PCR positives in the negative cohort using a mixed effective multivariable logistic regression analysis. <h4>Findings</h4> Between 18 June and 09 November 2020, 44 reinfections (2 probable, 42 possible) were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 6,614 participants, collectively contributing 1,339,078 days of follow-up. This compares with 318 new PCR positive infections and 94 antibody seroconversions in the negative cohort of 14,173 participants, contributing 1,868,646 days of follow-up. The incidence density per 100,000 person days between June and November 2020 was 3.3 reinfections in the positive cohort, compared with 22.4 new PCR confirmed infections in the negative cohort. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.24) compared to PCR confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was over 160 days. <h4>Interpretation</h4> A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection.

The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW), through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas in healthcare organizations. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk., METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a cross-sectional and incidence study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the Occupational Health Service (OHS) for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) was 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0009), including when data were also classified by age.

Enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland: population-based seroprevalence surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic,Dickson E.; Palmateer N.E.; Murray J.; Robertson C.; Waugh C.; Wallace L.A.; Mathie L.; Heatlie K.; Mavin S.; Gousias P.; Von Wissman B.; Goldberg D.J.; McAuley A. ,"Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. Study design/Methods: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods. Result(s): The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area. Conclusion(s): At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health",2021,/,Public Health,190,"(Dickson, Palmateer, Murray, Robertson, Waugh, Wallace, Mathie, Heatlie, Gousias, Von Wissman, Goldberg, McAuley) Public Health Scotland, Glasgow, United Kingdom(Palmateer, Goldberg, McAuley) School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian Universi",132-134,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.014,2010639581,#74458,Dickson 2021,"",""
Bayesian estimation of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Indiana by random testing.,"Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir","From 25 to 29 April 2020, the state of Indiana undertook testing of 3,658 randomly chosen state residents for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, the agent causing COVID-19 disease. This was the first statewide randomized study of COVID-19 testing in the United States. Both PCR and serological tests were administered to all study participants. This paper describes statistical methods used to address nonresponse among various demographic groups and to adjust for testing errors to reduce bias in the estimates of the overall disease prevalence in Indiana. These adjustments were implemented through Bayesian methods, which incorporated all available information on disease prevalence and test performance, along with external data obtained from census of the Indiana statewide population. Both adjustments appeared to have significant impact on the unadjusted estimates, mainly due to upweighting data in study participants of non-White races and Hispanic ethnicity and anticipated false-positive and false-negative test results among both the PCR and antibody tests utilized in the study.

Our objective was to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence amongst HCW and factors associated with seropositivity., METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluating 6190 workers (97.8% of the total workforce of a healthcare-system of 17 hospitals across four regions in Spain) was carried out between April and June 2020, by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and related clinical data. Exposure risk was categorized as high (clinical environment; prolonged/direct contact with patients), moderate (clinical environment; non-intense/no patient contact) and low (non-clinical environment)., RESULTS: A total of 6038 employees (mean age 43.8 years; 71% female) were included in the final analysis. A total of 662 (11.0%) were seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (39.4% asymptomatic). Adding available PCR-testing, 713 (11.8%) employees showed evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before antibody testing, 482 of them (67%) had no previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Seroprevalence was higher in high- and moderate-risk exposure (12.1 and 11.4%, respectively) compared with low-grade risk subjects (7.2%), and in Madrid (13.8%) compared with Barcelona (7.6%) and Coruna (2.0%). High-risk [odds ratio (OR): 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-2.62] and moderate-risk (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.32-2.37) exposures were associated with positive IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after adjusting for region, age and sex. Higher antibody titres were observed in moderate-severe disease (median antibody-titre: 13.7 AU/mL) compared with mild (6.4 AU/mL) and asymptomatic (5.1 AU/mL) infection, and also in older (>60 years: 11.8 AU/mL) compared with younger (<30 years: 4.2 AU/mL) people., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW is a little higher than in the general population and varies depending on regional COVID-19 incidence. The high rates of subclinical and previously undiagnosed infection observed in this study reinforce the utility of antibody screening.

Here we report results from the baseline (13 to 18 July 2020) and the first month of follow-up (13 to 18 August 2020) study. Findings: We enrolled a total of 716 participants and estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0%-73.4%), a test-re-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0%-68.3%), and an incidence of new exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.2%) data that suggest that transmission is ongoing but is occurring at low levels.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were measured concomitantly in patient sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: The risk of severe COVID-19 according to 2 recent scores differed among the analyzed patients. All patients were well educated about their presumed higher risk of a severe COVID-19 and described performing self-isolation wherever possible. Nevertheless, 20 patients reported contact with someone suspected of having COVID-19 or who tested positive shortly thereafter (18%).

However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50-59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden of infection and disease in populations. <h4>Key points</h4> <h4>Question</h4> We aimed to implement a fully remote seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV-2, leveraging electronic methods and at-home self-collection of specimens to engage a representative study population. <h4>Findings</h4> The population enrolled reflected the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts, revealing a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 3.15% and higher risk of previous infection associated with healthcare workers/their cohabitants, those with comorbidities, lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in age groups 18-29 and 50-59 years old. <h4>Meaning</h4> High engagement and positive feedback from participants as well as quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies.",2021,,,,,,PPR265314,10.1101/2021.01.14.21249824,,#75374,Aatresh 2021,"",""
Detection of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients,"Alshami, Alanoud; Alattas, Rabab; Azzam, Ahmed; Mohammed, Amani","<h4>Background: </h4> The seroprevalance of SARS-COV-2 infection have been studied in immunocompetent children. However, data in pediatric Kidney Transplant population (PKT) is lacking. Methods We screened 72 PKT patients who came for routine blood work in the outpatient clinic using two commercial immunoassays that measures IgG antibodies against SARS-COV-2 spike protein and IgG against the Nucleocapsid protein. Majority of patients with positive serology had their serology test repeated at least once during subsequent clinic follow up. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-COV-2 infection if they only have both tests positive. Results Eight patients out of the 72 screened (11.1%) had positive SARS-COV-2 IgG antibodies in both serological tests. Of those tested positive, 4 had positive SARS-COV-2 PCR before screening. All patients were asymptomatic or had history of mild symptoms. All tested patient had persistently positive antibodies at median follow-up time of 75 days (IQR, 44.5, 86.5). One patient remained to have positive PCR at 75 days and positive serology test at 120 days post infection. conclusion The Serooprevalence of SARS-COV-2 was relatively high (11.1%) in our population. SARS-COV-2 PCR seems to remain positive in PKT population for longer duration than general population. Although, all patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, they mounted a strong humoral immune response that persisted for few months despite being on triple immunosuppressants.

Lack of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among Blood Donors during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Study from Saudi Arabia.,"Alandijany, Thamir A; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Al-Ghamdi, Abrar A; Qashqari, Fadi S; Faizo, Arwa A; Tolah, Ahmed M; Hassan, Ahmed M; Sohrab, Sayed S; Hindawi, Salwa I; Badawi, Maha A; Azhar, Esam I","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Saudi Arabia have imposed timely restrictions to minimize the infection spread, lower the risk for vulnerable groups, and reduce the pressure on healthcare services. The effectiveness of these measures has not been assessed comprehensively and, thereby, remains uncertain. Besides monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed by molecular assays, the seroprevalence can serve as an indicator for the incidence rate among the general population. This study aimed to evaluate seroprevalence status of all healthy blood donors who attended one of the main largest hospital located in the western region of Saudi Arabia from 1 January to 31 May 2020. The study period covered two months prior to reporting the first COVID-19 case in the country on 2 March 2020. Importantly, it covered the period when ""lock-down type"" measures have been enforced. Samples were subjected to in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and microneutralization (MN).

Method(s): HCWs at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, filled in questionnaires and provided serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody screening by Euroimmun IgG assay in March-April 2020. Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+). Result(s): The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4% of those RT-PCR-negative.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the general population and high-risk occupational groups across 18 cities in Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study,Poustchi H.; Darvishian M.; Mohammadi Z.; Shayanrad A.; Delavari A.; Bahadorimonfared A.; Eslami S.; Javanmard S.H.; Shakiba E.; Somi M.H.; Emami A.; Saki N.; Hormati A.; Ansari-Moghaddam A.; Saeedi M.; Ghasemi-Kebria F.; Mohebbi I.; Mansour-Ghanaei F.; Karami M.; Sharifi H.; Pourfarzi F.; Veisi N.; Ghadimi R.; Eghtesad S.; Niavarani A.; Ali Asgari A.; Sadeghi A.; Sorouri M.; Anushiravani A.; Amani M.; Kaveh S.; Feizesani A.; Tabarsi P.; Keyvani H.; Markarian M.; Shafighian F.; Sima A.; Sadjadi A.; Radmard A.R.; Mokdad A.H.; Sharafkhah M.; Malekzadeh R. ,"Background: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. Method(s): In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). Finding(s): From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. Interpretation(s): Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

We assessed age effects and clinical utility of serum SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies and serum inflammatory markers. Serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels were measured using chemiluminescence assays from Diazyme (Poway, CA), while serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin were measured with immunoassays obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). In 79,005 subjects, IgG and IgM levels were positive (≥1.0 arbitrary units [AU]/mL) in 5.29% and 3.25% of subjects, respectively. In antibody positive subjects, median IgG levels were 3.93 AU/mL if <45 years of age, 10.18 AU/mL if 45-64 years of age, and 10.85 AU/mL if ≥65 years of age (p<0.0001). In SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases, family members and exposed subjects (n=1,111), antibody testing was found to be valuable for case finding, and persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic symptoms. In non-hospitalized and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n=278), median IgG levels in AU/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects (n=100), 14.83 in positive outpatients (n=129), and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients (n=49, p<0.0001).

Our data indicate that: 1) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects, possibly to compensate for decreased cellular immunity with aging; 2) IgG levels are important for case finding in family clusters; 3) IgG levels are significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels; 4) persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic disease; and 5) markedly elevated IL-6, hs-CRP, and/or positive IgM accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive subjects requiring hospitalization.",2021,,,,,,PPR269196,10.1101/2021.01.19.21249604,,#75450,Schaefer 2021,"",""

The RESPONSE (REDS-IV-P Epidemiology, Surveillance and Preparedness of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic) study conducted monthly cross-sectional serosurveys of 1000 routinely obtained donor samples in 6 metropolitan regions (see table). Study Design/Methods: Samples were captured monthly from March or April through June 2020. Siteswere selected based on reports of epidemic activity or as low prevalence control regions. Donations from COVID- 19 convalescent plasma donors were excluded. Coded samples, with routinely collected demographic data and zip code of residence, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Ortho VITROS anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 Total Ig (data reported below) with planned confirmation of reactivity on Roche Elecsys NC Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay.

Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time., STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON RSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods., RESULTS: The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area., CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.

Other studies have assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies in HCWs, with disparate findings regarding risk based on role and demographics., Methods: We screened 3904 employees and clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 virus positivity and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G at a major New Jersey hospital from April 28 to June 30, 2020. We assessed positive tests in relation to demographic and occupational characteristics and prior coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms using multivariable logistic regression models., Results: Thirteen participants (0.3%) tested positive for virus and 374 (9.6%) tested positive for IgG (total positive: 381 [9.8%]). Compared with participants with no patient care duties, the odds of positive testing (virus or antibodies) were higher for those with direct patient contact: below-median patient contact, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.71 and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-2.48; above-median patient contact, aOR = 1.98 and 95% CI = 1.35-2.91. The proportion of participants testing positive was highest for phlebotomists (23.9%), maintenance/housekeeping (17.3%), dining/food services (16.9%), and interpersonal/support roles (13.7%) despite lower levels of direct patient care duties. Positivity rates were lower among doctors (7.2%) and nurses (9.1%), roles with fewer underrepresented minorities. After adjusting for job role and patient care responsibilities and other factors, Black and Latinx workers had 2-fold increased odds of a positive test compared with white workers. Loss of smell, taste, and fever were associated with positive testing., Conclusions: The HCW categories at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection include support staff and underrepresented minorities with and without patient care responsibilities.

Association of Health Status and Smoking Behaviors with SARS-CoV-2 Positivity Rates,"Duszynski, Thomas; Fadel, William; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara; Dixon, Brian; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul; Menachemi, Nir","<h4>Background: </h4> Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or tobacco use is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. <h4>Methods: </h4> Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n= 8,214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. <h4>Result: </h4> s Compared to people with self-identified “excellent” or very good health status, those reporting “good” or “fair” health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> In a statewide, community-based population drawn for seroprevalence studies, we find that overall health status is associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

However, its ability to cause severe disease is not homogeneous according to sex and the different age groups., Objective: To determine perinatal characteristics, morbidity, mortality, and serological results in neonates from seropositive pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2., Methods: We did a retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study. We included all newborns from positive pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2, between April 15 and May 10, 2020, who delivered in the National Perinatal Maternal Institute of Peru. The study extracted maternal and neonatal variables collected from the medical charts. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fischer's exact test., Results: One hundred fourteen neonates were identified, 36.8% IgM/IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2, 7% IgG, and 56.2% had negative serology. The obstetric complications were premature rupture of membranes (14.9%) and preterm birth (8,8%). 8.8% of newborns had an Apgar score of less than or equal to six minutes, and of those, only one persisted after five minutes; three newborns died. There was an association between the type of maternal immunoglobulin and the serology of the newborn (p < 0.05). No association was observed between perinatal results and maternal immunoglobulin type (p > 0.05) or serological results in the newborn for SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05)., Conclusion: 43.9% of seropositive mothers' neonates to SARS-CoV-2 had a positive serological result, more frequently type IgM/IgG. 10.5% of the neonates had some morbidity, more frequent prematurity, low birth weight, and 2.6% died.

Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies in Southern Italy's hospital staff,Paolillo C.; De Carlo A.; Lo Caputo S.; Rosa A.M.; Santantonio T.A.; D'Appolito O.; Migliucci F.; Sernia G.; Sordo A.M.; Papale M.; Trivisano T.; Dattoli V.; Margaglione M.; Corso G. ,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Respiratory/aerial droplets transmission and the high number of ""hidden"" asymptomatic cases play a critical role in the rapid spread of the virus across countries. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population is currently unknown. It has been estimated that undocumented infections were the source for #80% of the documented cases before traveling restriction policies took place. Serological evaluation is essential for investigating the extent of SARS-CoV-2. Even more, assessing the prevalence of anti-SARSCoV-2 in hospital staff offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and at higher risk of contagious. Method(s): The study enrolled a total of 3242 employees of our hospital, ""Policlinico Riuniti"" of Foggia. The employees' group was stratified in 3 subgroups according to their relative exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high, intermediate, and low-risk groups). We used a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech) to study the seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies (IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid and spike proteins). The cut-off was set to 8 AU/mL for both IgG and IgM (specificity of 98,8% and 100%, respectively). A control group of 83 samples sera collected before the Italian COVID-19 outbreak (2018-19) was also tested. Healthcare workers with IgG or IgM concentration above 6.0 and below 8.0 AU/mL were considered borderline. Nevertheless, all of them were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA presence (AllplexTM 2019 n-CoV Assay, Seegene). Result(s): Sixty-two individuals (1.9%, 1.4-2.3%, 95% CI) tested positive for at least one antibody anti-SARS-CoV-2. Five individuals (8.0% of the positive) had IgG and IgM positive test results, while 32 and 25 had only IgG and only IgM positive results. Instead, viral RNA was detected in only nine individuals (13.8% of Ig positive) by RTPCR. The cumulative proportion of individuals who tested positive (IgG and/or IgM) varied between 1-2.4%. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428,0.5-2.6%, 95% CI) vs. intermediate-risk group 2.0 % (55/2736, 1.5-2.5%, 95% CI). Only one participant (1.3%, 0-3.8%, 95% CI) of the low-risk group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies.

The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of Modena. the screening on more than 7000 subjects,Pecoraro V.; Carone C.; Debbia D.; De Santis E.; De Santis C.; Gargiulo R.; Melegari A.; Lelli N.; Roli L.; Rota C.; Scacchetti A.T.; Sarti M.; Trenti T. ,"Introduction:Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and during outbreak more than 30 thousand of them were infected. From April, in Emilia-Romagna Region, the screening for all HCWs has started through serological tests. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies (Abs) anti SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs affiliated to AUSL of Modena. Method(s):We analysed data on asymptomatic HCWs, to assess the immunological status for the regional screening, that allows Abs to be detected every two weeks. In case of positivity to serological test, SARSCoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal/oropharingeal swab takes place by RT-PCR. Result(s): From 30 March to 31 May 2020, 7711 HCWs were screened using commercial immunocromatography and chemiluminescent tests to detect specific Abs IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2. 7361 (95.4%) were IgG and IgM negative while 350(5%) were IgG and/or IgM positive. In particular, 72 (0.9%) were IgG+ and IgM+, 233 (3%) were IgG+ and IgM-, 45 (0.6%) were IgG- A nd IgM+. At follow up, 4.6% of analyzed subjects were positive, of these 4.2% was IgG+ and only the 0.4% was IgM+. The RT-PCR performed on positive HCWs revealed that 7% of them was positive for viral RNA. Conclusion(s): Serological tests could bridge the gap between the disease and symptoms onset, allowing to detect both active and past infection when used as screening. Results of serological tests were influenced by several factors: In asymptomatic people it is difficult to establish the moment of contact, so it is plausible that the serological tests were negative because the body hasn't had the time to develop the antibodies. Conversely, detection of a very low percentage of IgM in conjunction with high IgG levels could be due to a remote contact with the virus, but also due to a scarce sensibility of tests. Furthermore, it is more likely that the asymptomatic people develop a little or no immune reaction because they didn't developed symptoms. Although the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is low among HCWs of Modena, Abs detection could be useful to detect subjects who developed an immune response, and to understand the epidemiology of the infection.",2020,/,Biochimica Clinica,44,SUPPL 2,S38,,,633621604,#67569,Pecoraro 2020,"",""

Although new anti-coronavirus antibodies in patients may be identified by immunological methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, the conclusive diagnosis of the disease is by the molecular RT-PCR process. We used a population-based seroepidemiological survey to quantify the proportion of the exposed population with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and evaluated whether the antibodies are a marker of total or partial immunity to the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to the virus. This cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CoVID-19 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, between April and end of October 2020. Specimens of clotted and heparinized blood (2ml) were collected from the patients. The serum and plasma were separated and stored at −80  C until use. We examined serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies from 1375 in-patients admitted to our hospitals using ELISA kits. In total, 1375 participants were enrolled in this study, and SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were detected using IgM‐IgG antibody assay in 291 patients. Among the seropositive patients studied, 187 were men (64.3%), and 104 were women (35.7%) (P<0.05). The mean age of the patients was 49 years; the majority (27%) were in age group 31-40 years. Also, the lowest frequency of cases was reported in the age group of 1-10 years (P <0.05). We determined the seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 for IgM or IgG antibodies to be 21.2%. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among SARS‐CoV‐2 patients [P=0.05; Odd Ratio=1.61(0.90-2.91)].

We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions. <h4>Findings</h4> We estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%-14.3%] by the end of November.

This study is the first investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia., OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the current pandemic., METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20 to 25 May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher prevalence compared to citizens (odds ratio 13.6, p = 0.001). Having a secondary education as the highest level of education was also significantly associated with high seroprevalence compared to higher education (odds ratio 6.8, p = 0.005).

Population-based seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a high-altitude setting in Peru,"HUAMANI, CHARLES; Velasquez, Lucio; Montes, Sonia; Mayanga Herrera, Ana; Bernabe-Ortiz, Antonio","<h4>Background: </h4> Little evidence exists about the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at high altitude. We aimed to estimate the population-based seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco at the end of the first wave. <h4>Methods:</h4> A population-based survey was conducted in September 2020 in three settings in Cusco: (1) Cusco city at 3300 meters above the sea level (m.a.s.l.), (2) the periphery of Cusco (Santiago, San Jeronimo, San Sebastian, and Wanchaq) at 3300 m.a.s.l., and (3) Quillabamba city, located at 1050 m.a.s.l. People aged greater than or equal 18 years within a family unit were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on identifying total antibodies (IgM and IgG) anti- SARS-CoV-2 in serum using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence test. Findings: We enrolled 1924 participants from 712 families. Of the total, 637 participants were COVID-19 seropositive. Seroprevalence was 38.8% (95%CI: 33.4%-44.9%) in Cusco city, 34.9% (95%CI: 30.4%-40.1%) in the periphery of Cusco, and 20.3% (95%CI: 16.2%-25.6%) in Quillabamba. In 141 families (19.8%; 95%CI: 17.0%-22.8%) the whole members were positive to the test. Living with more than three persons in the same house, a positive COVID-19 case at home, and a member who died in the last five months were factors associated with COVID-19 positivity. The smell/taste alteration was the symptom most associated with seropositivity (aOR= 14.27, 95% CI: 8.24-24.70); whereas always wearing a face shield (aOR= 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46- 0.84) or a facial mask (aOR= 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.88) reduced that probability. Interpretation: Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco was high, with significant differences between settings.

This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV2 sero-positivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection. <h4>Methods</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi-urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecsys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS-CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained. <h4>Findings</h4> 1058 individuals (10·14%) had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. A follow-up on 346 sero-positive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of sero-positive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one-fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for sero-positivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1·79, 1·43 – 2·24, 2·81561E-06), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2·23, 1·92 – 2·59, 6·43969E-26), non-smokers (1·52, 1·16 – 1·99, 0·02) and non-vegetarianism (1·67, 1·41 – 1·99, 3·03821E-08). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for sero-positivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups -O was associated with a lower risk. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In a first-of-its-kind study from India, we report the sero-positivity in a country-wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much-sought-for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies. <h4>Funding</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR)",2021,,,,,,PPR266477,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249713,,#75413,Naushin 2021,"",""
A cross-sectional seroprevalence for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a tertially care hospital in Taiwan.,"Pan, Sung-Ching; Huang, Yu-Shan; Hsieh, Szu-Min; Chen, Yee-Chun; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Chang, Shan-Chwen","BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline during the pandemic of COVID-19 globally. According to the WHO situation report at April 17, there were 22, 073 HCWs contracted the infection. Whether the infection control policy and practice in the hospital setting can protect the HCWs is an important issue., METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan to explore the sero-prevalence rate among HCWs. The participants are enrolled on a voluntary basis. A structured questionnaire was collected to gather the epidemiology character and risk factors for potential exposure. ELISA tests as Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) were used to detect antibody responses. If any of the tests was positive, a western blot assay was used for confirmation., RESULTS: There were 194 HCWs participated during July 1 to Aug. 31, 2020. The mean age was 36.3 +/- 10.4. More than half of the participants had possible hospital associated risk for COVID-19 exposure (110/192, 57.3%) and 64 had possible community risk for COVID-19 exposure (64/194, 33.0%). There was only one participant had positive test by Architect IgG test and confirmed to be negative for seasonal coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 antibody. (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Germany)., CONCLUSION: The cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan revealed no HCWs had positive serology response to SARS-CoV-2. We believe that the infection control policy and practice in the hospital and in the community are both important to prevent the disease transmission. Copyright © 2021 Formosan Medical Association.

We used the Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, health care delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status., Results: A total of 6510 HCWs, including 1794 nurses and 904 non-patient-facing administrators, participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were White, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic, and 3.1% were non-Hispanic Black. The crude prevalence of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% CI, 4.6%-5.2%). Seropositivity varied by race/ethnicity as well as age, ranging from 4.2% to 9.6%. Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs, 15.0% (95% CI, 12.2%-18.1%) of whom were seropositive; those with family members diagnosed with COVID-19 had a seropositivity rate of 54% (95% CI, 44.2%-65.2%). Support service workers (10.4%; 95% CI, 4.6%-19.4%), medical assistants (10.1%; 95% CI, 5.5%-16.6%), and nurses (7.6%; 95% CI, 6.4%-9.0%) had significantly higher seropositivity rates than administrators (referent; 3.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%-4.4%). However, after adjustment, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher odds (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy and hemodialysis was significantly associated with 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively., Conclusions: HCWs are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection from longer-duration exposures to people infected with SARS-CoV-2 within health care settings and their communities of residence.

Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Screening of Healthcare Workers in the Southern Part of Kyoto City During the COVID-19 Pre-pandemic Period.,"Fujita, Kohei; Kada, Shinpei; Kanai, Osamu; Hata, Hiroaki; Odagaki, Takao; Satoh-Asahara, Noriko; Tagami, Tetsuya; Yasoda, Akihiro","Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with a heavy burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. While understanding of the incidence and case-fatality rates has increased, there are limited data concerning seroprevalence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare workers during the pre-pandemic period. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers in the southern part of Kyoto city, Japan. Methods: We prospectively recruited healthcare workers from a single hospital between April 10 and April 20, 2020. We collected serum samples from these participants and quantitatively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Five (5.4%), 15 (16.3%), and 72 (78.3%) participants showed positive, borderline, and negative serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status, respectively. We found the mean titer associated with each antibody status (overall, positive, borderline, and negative) was clearly differentiated. Participants working at the otolaryngology department and/or with a history of seasonal common cold symptoms had a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer (p = 0.046, p = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Five (5.4%) and 15 (16.3%) participants tested positive and borderline, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody during the COVID-19 pre-pandemic period. These rates were higher than expected, based on government situation reports. These findings suggest that COVID-19 had already spread within the southern part of Kyoto city at the early stage of the pandemic.

Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG Antibodies in a Cohort of Municipal First Responders.,"McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D","BACKGROUND: Although first responders (FRs) represent a high-risk group for exposure, little information is available regarding their risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs)., METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups., RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07)., CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 spread in homeless persons in the city of Rome, Italy. Design and Methods: Patients included in the study underwent a clinical evaluation and rapid antibody analysis on capillary blood for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptomatic patients were not included in the screening and immediately referred to local hospitals for further evaluation. Results: One-hundred seventy-three patients of both sexes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serological test. Age range was 10-80 years; people came from 35 different countries of origin and 4 continents. Test results were negative for most patients (170-98.2%); two patients had positive IgM (1.2%) and one patient had positive IgG (0.6%). Conclusions: Our study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people experiencing homelessness in the city of Rome, Italy. Most patients were negative for COVID- 19, although several factors may have had an impact on this result, such as the exclusion of symptomatic patients, the limited sensitivity of rapid serological tests in the initial stage of infection and the prevention measures adopted in these populations.

Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly. <h4>Methods</h4> Five companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR. <h4>Results</h4> Among home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Personnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. <h4>Methods:</h4> We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months.

The Silent Pandemic COVID-19 in the Asymptomatic Population,"Stout, Robert; Rigatti, Steven","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world there is a great need to understand the dynamics of spread. Currently the seroprevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 doubles every 3 months, this silent epidemic of new infections may be the main driving force behind the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases. Public health official quickly recognized that clinical cases were just the tip of the iceberg. In fact a great deal of the spread was being driven by the asymptomatically infected who continued to go out, socialize and go to work. While seropositivity is an insensitive marker for acute infection it does tell us about the prevalence COVID-19 in the population. <h4>Objective</h4> Describe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States over time. <h4>Methodology</h4> Repeated convenience samples from a commercial laboratory dedicated to the assessment of life insurance applicants were tested for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, in several time periods between May and December of 2020. US census data were used to estimate the population prevalence of seropositivity. <h4>Results</h4> The raw seroprevalence in the May-June, September, and December timeframes were 3.0%, 6.6% and 10.4%, respectively. Higher rates were noted in younger vs. older age groups. Total estimated seroprevalence in the US is estimated at 25.7 million cases. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a significantly larger pool of individuals who have contract COVID-19 and recovered, implying a lower case rate of hospitalizations and deaths than have been reported so far.",2021,,,,,,PPR260639,10.1101/2020.12.29.20248985,,#73007,Stout 2021,"",""

Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience from 181 patients in New York.,"Fierro, Luca; Nesheiwat, Nora; Naik, Hetanshi; Narayanan, Praveena; Mistry, Pramod K; Balwani, Manisha","SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid beta-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients.

The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too., OBJECTIVES: to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated., RESULTS: 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects., CONCLUSIONS: the seroprevalence values estimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence.

A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms,"Wagner, Angelika; Guzek, Angela; Ruff, Johanna; Jasinska, Joanna; Scheikl, Ute; Zwazl, Ines; Kundi, Michael; Stockinger, Hannes; Farcet, Maria; Kreil, Thomas; Hoeltl, Eva; Wiedermann, Ursula","<h4>Background</h4> In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. <h4>Findings</h4> We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG-borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies. <h4>Interpretation</h4> RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection. <h4>Funding</h4> This study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020 0225 104). <h4>Key points</h4> Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> At the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the interpretation of the antibody’s qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in low-prevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first months, assays targeting these antigen specificities – in contrast to RBD-specific antibody measurements – are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild COVID-19.",2020,,,,,,PPR256355,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248604,,#72873,Wagner 2020,"",""

As the capital of China, Beijing took a series of strict containment measures during the past several months. However, the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing has not been evaluated. METHODS During April 15-18, 2020, residents in Beijing were enrolled using a multi-stage cluster random sampling technique in four districts with top COVID-19 incidence and one district without case reported. Communities and households in each district were randomly selected based on probability proportional to size. Blood samples were collected and antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were tested by two kinds of colloidal gold kits. All colloidal gold positive serums and 20 randomly selected negative serums were then tested by Micro-neutralization assay. A likelihood ratio test was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals of seroprevalence with the Clopper-Pearson exact method. RESULTS A total of 2,184 residents participated in this survey, among which 13 were tested positive by colloidal gold tests. Of those who tested positive, 8 were IgM positive, 3 were IgG positive, 1 was total antibody positive, 1 was both IgM and total antibody positive. Among the 13 seropositive samples and 20 randomly selected seronegative samples, no positive sample was detected by micro-neutralization assay. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing was estimated no higher than 0.17%. CONCLUSIONS The seroprevalence of COVID-19 was low in April suggests that the comprehensive control measures to prevent and control further spread in Beijing was effective.

Covert cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: An obscure but present danger in regions endemic for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses.,"Stringari, Lorenzzo Lyrio; de Souza, Michel Norbim; de Medeiros Junior, Nesio Fernandes; Goulart, Jaqueline Pegoretti; Giuberti, Camila; Dietze, Reynaldo; Ribeiro-Rodrigues, Rodrigo","BACKGROUND: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in regions endemic for both Dengue and Chikungunya is still not fully understood. Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil., METHODS: Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020., FINDINGS: Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed., INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya.",2021,/,PloS one,16,1,e0244937,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244937,33406122,#72660,Stringari 2021,"",""

Serological analysis was applied for assessing some metric epidemiological aspects of the infection and its transmissibility among people who were in contact with SARA-CoV-2 patients. <h4>Methods: </h4> In this contact tracing prospective cohort study, 453 contact cases of forty COVID 19 patients were followed for three months. SARS-CoV-2 patients were diagnosed by real time polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. The history of infectiousness was detected by serological testing of IgG and IgM. Trained expert team completed two questionnaires and blood samples were taken by experts in laboratory. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Ver.21) and R software. Some important epidemiological characteristics of the infection were calculated. <h4>Result: </h4> s Mean age of SARS-CoV-2 patients and contact cases were 53.0±18.2 and 30.8±19.3 years, respectively. Overall R 0 of the infection was 2.56. Household and non-household secondary attack rates (SAR) were 20% (95%CI; 12.7 – 27.3) and 11.3% (95%CI; 6.1-16.5), respectively. Transmission probability in each contact was 0.0205 and the serial interval was 6.4±4.6 (95% CI; 5.2–7.6) days. SAR among contact cases who exposed asymptomatic primary cases (28%, 95%CI; 10-46%) was higher than that (13.8%, 95%CI;9.4-18.2) among contact cases exposing to symptomatic patients. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> We concluded a herd immunity between 60 and 65% is needed in human communities.

Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals., INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation., RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs., CONCLUSIONS: The results of serosurveillance suggest that the population of Ahmedabad is still largely susceptible. People still need to follow preventive measures to protect themselves till an effective vaccine is available to the people at large. The data indicate the possibility of vanishing immunity over time and need further research to cross verify with scientific evidences. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Prevalence and Clinical Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Silent Carriers Among Actively Treated Patients with Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Zambelli, Alberto; Chiudinelli, Lorenzo; Fotia, Vittoria; Negrini, Giorgia; Bosetti, Tommaso; Callegaro, Annapaola; Di Croce, Andrea; Caremoli, Elena Rota; Moro, Cecilia; Milesi, Laura; Poletti, Paola; Tasca, Cristina; Mandala, Mario; Merelli, Barbara; Mosconi, Stefania; Arnoldi, Ermenegildo; Bettini, Anna; Bonomi, Lucia; Messina, Caterina; Ghilardi, Laura; Chirco, Alessandra; Maracino, Michela; Tondini, Carlo","INTRODUCTION: In Europe, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicenter in Italy. Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers., RESULTS: In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness., CONCLUSION: Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.

The reliability of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing - a pilot study in asymptomatic health care workers in a Croatian university hospital.,"Lapic, Ivana; Rogic, Dunja; Segulja, Dragana; Kralik Oguic, Sasa; Knezevic, Josip","AIM: To evaluate three fully automated serological assays in terms of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and perform SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing among asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) at the University Hospital Center Zagreb., METHODS: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays., RESULTS: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.",2020,/,Croatian medical journal,61,6,485-490,,,33410294,#72672,Lapic 2020,"",""

Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers. <h4>Methods</h4> Residual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures. <h4>Results</h4> We tested 112,941 individuals (∼10% of Qatar’s urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Fewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar’s urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.",2021,,,,,,PPR261818,10.1101/2021.01.05.21249247,,#73032,Coyle 2021,"",""

Risk constellations and rates of seroconversion for health care workers during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still largely unclear., METHODS: Health care personnel (n=300) on different organizational units in the LMU Munich University Hospital were included and followed in this prospective longitudinal study in the period of March 24 until July 7, 2020. Participants were monitored in intervals of two to six weeks using different antibody assays for serological testing and questionnaires to evaluate risk contacts. In a subgroup of infected participants, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to perform whole genome sequencing for outbreak characterization., RESULTS: Health care workers involved in patient care on dedicated COVID-19 wards or on regular non-COVID-19 wards showed a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion compared to staff in the emergency department and non-frontline personnel. The landscape of risk contacts in these units was dynamic, with a decrease of unprotected risk contacts in the emergency department and an increase on non-COVID-19 wards. Both, the intensity and number of risk contacts, were associated with higher rates of seroconversion. On regular wards, staff infections tended to occur in clusters, while infections on COVID-19 wards were less frequent and apparently independent of each other., CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for front-line health care workers was increased during the first pandemic wave in Southern Germany. Stringent measures for infection control are essential to protect all patient-facing staff during the ongoing pandemic. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the country’s most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection. <h4>Design</h4> In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors ( n= 2,100) and pregnant women ( n= 2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14 th March and 11 th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls ( n= 595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807. <h4>Setting</h4> Healthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital. <h4>Participants</h4> None of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples. <h4>Results</h4> Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened ( n= 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response. <h4>Conclusions</h4> In agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. <h4>General abstract</h4> Public health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women ( n= 4,100) were sampled at random between 14 th March-11 th December 2020. All individuals ( n= 200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls ( n= 595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.",2020,,,,,,PPR258021,10.1101/2020.12.24.20248821,,#72921,Dopico 2020,"",""

In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. <h4>Methods</h4> Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools. <h4>Results</h4> Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously seropositive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with high participation rate, 0, 1-2 or ≥3 seropositive children were present in 73 (56%), 50 (38%) and 7 (5%) classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation of random effects (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Under a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Trial registration</h4> ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717 . https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717",2020,,,,,,PPR256319,10.1101/2020.12.19.20248513,,#72867,Ulyte 2020,"",""

Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary., METHODS: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning., RESULTS: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected.

Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A logistic regression model adjusting for these factors showed significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk.

The present study aims to characterize the nature of exposure and to describe the local population dynamics underlying its apparent resistance to COVID-19, hypothesizing the presence of several co-factors that may have protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Methods:</h4> Descriptive study of an isolated population cohort, including SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and viral prevalence in samples of saliva assessed through RT-qPCR. We conducted seroprevalence screening from April 29 to May 3, 2020 across the three main settlements on the island. We invited the adult resident population, present on the island to undergo testing by rapid serologic assay and to provide a sample of saliva, which was cryopreserved for molecular validation. We monitored the participation through the official municipality residents list. Serologic testing was performed using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test while molecular analyses were carried out by Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene). <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 634 residents out of 748 (84.8%) present at the time, and 89 non-residents underwent serological testing. 364 males and 359 females with a median age of 58.5 years. The serological screening identified one positive, asymptomatic subject. The Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) did not yield any positive result. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Despite extensive exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only one new asymptomatic infection occurred in this population, as documented by IgM positivity not confirmed by RT-qPCR. This may be due to unknown protective factors or chance. On the basis of this first descriptive study, using its population as a reference model, further investigations will be conducted to characterize the summer period exposure and to test the advanced hypotheses, focusing on the evaluation of a possible cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 from exposure to endemic viruses.",2021,,,,,,PPR263449,10.1101/2021.01.08.20248948,,#73076,Bognanni 2021,"",""

Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well protected, due to their strategic role in patient management, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. Here, we present the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain., METHODS: IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. Samples were collected after the first pandemic wave (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) and were analyzed by automated chemiluminescence assays. All samples were tested for IgG anti-S1/S2. Participant samples with negative or equivocal results but with analytical signals above the limit of detection and/or previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were also tested for IgG anti-Nucleocapsid., RESULTS: A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, among 341 participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 36 (10.55%) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (both S1/S2 and recombinant N antigen)., CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the North Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was higher than in the general population in the same geographical area.

It is unclear what percentage of people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and what percentage of population is carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in WH. We retrospectively analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody positive rates in 63,107 healthy individuals from WH and other places of China using commercial colloidal gold detection kits from March 6 to May 3, 2020. Statistical approaches were utilized to explore the difference and correlation for the seropositive rate of IgG and IgM antibody on the basis of sex, age group, geographic region and detection date. The total IgG and IgM antibody positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.68% (186/11,086) in WH, 0.59% (226/38,171) in Hubei Province without Wuhan (HB), and 0.38% (53/13,850) in the nation except for Hubei Province (CN), respectively. The IgM positive rate was 0.46% (51/11,086) in WH, 0.13% (51/38,171) in HB, and 0.07% (10/13,850) in CN. The incidence of IgM positive rates in healthy individuals increased from March 6 to May 3, 2020 in WH.

Statistical analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity was performed according to the children's general demographic characteristics, timing of admission to hospital, presence of pneumonia, and viral nucleic acid test results., Results: The study included 19 797 children with both IgM and IgG antibody results. Twenty-four children had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive results (positive rate of 1.2), twelve children had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive results (positive rate of 0.6). Viral nucleic acid test results were negative for the above-mentioned children with positive antibody findings; during the study, two children exhibited positive viral nucleic acid test results, but their anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody results were negative. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody seropositivity was higher in the <1-year-old group than in the >=6-year-old group. The rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM seropositivity was highest in August from March to August; IgG results did not significantly differ over time.

On a total of 196 serum samples (at least 2 serum samples for each HW), LFA and ELISA tests for SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM were performed. Also, 32 serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients at least 21 days before sampling, and 30 serum samples of patients obtained up to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak in China, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively., Findings: Of the 65 HWs enrolled, 6 were positive in LFA; overall, of the 196 serum samples, 20 were positive in LFA. All ELISA tests performed on serum samples collected from HWs were negative. The specificity of LFAs was 90.77% considering the 65 HWs and 89.80% considering all the 196 health workers serum samples analyzed. Considering the data on HWs, ELISA test for SARS-COV-2 antibodies showed a specificity of 100%, including all the 196 serum samples collected, and 100% including the 65 HWs. The ELISA and LFAs performed after 21 days last COVID-19 patient was discharged were all negative., Conclusion: LFAs compared to ELISA tests result in less specificity, considering COVID-19 negative personnel and patients.

We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China., Methods: We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020., Findings: Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 91.1% (41 of 45 [95% CI 78.8-97.5]) for the microneutralisation assay, 57.8% (26 of 45 [42.2-72.3]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 66.7% (30 of 45 [51.1-80.0]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 73.3% (33 of 45 [58.1-85.4]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 97.6-100.0]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (2.7%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified., Interpretation: Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis.

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design., METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382., FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time., INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care.

Prevalence of COVID-19 Among Typical Ambulatory Care Patients in a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom.,"Arif, Muhammad; Maaref Doost, Mina","Objectives This observational retrospective study was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among typical ambulatory care patients. In our hospital, ambulatory care unit (ACU) was supposed to be a COVID-19 free area, and, hence, as per the guidelines, even basic personal protection equipment (PPE) was not provided during the early phase of pandemic. Methods We identified 443 patients who presented to our ACU between March and June 2020 with chest pain or shortness of breath suspected of pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome, which normally makes the bulk of referrals to ACU. As per protocol, patients with COVID-19-like symptoms, e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell, were excluded from ACU. We then, reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans for radiological evidence of COVID-19, and lab data for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody tests, to find out if any of our patients turned out to be suffering from COVID-19 unexpectedly. Results We found 13 patients with radiological or serological evidence of COVID-19, which equates to a prevalence of 2.93% in this cohort of our ambulatory care patients. Four in our patient cohort showed radiological features that were highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia; 47 chest CT scans were performed, which may suggest a prevalence of around 8.5% (4/47) on radiological ground if everyone was offered a CT scan. Conclusions Due to limited access to data, our result is likely an underestimation of the actual prevalence of COVID-19 among our ACU patients, highlighting the need to review the safety and PPE guidelines for the ambulatory clinic and any similar out-patient areas.

In this work, we aim to evaluate a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) regarding analytical, diagnostic, operational and clinical characteristics. Our work takes the form of a population-based study in the principality of Liechtenstein, including 125 cases with clinically well-described and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1159 individuals without evidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 cases were tested for antibodies in sera taken with a median of 48 days (interquartile range, IQR, 43-52) and 139 days (IQR, 129-144) after symptom onset. Sera were also tested with other assays targeting antibodies against non-RBD-S1 and -S1/S2 epitopes. Sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 93.2-99.1), whereas specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.4-99.9). Antibody levels linearly decreased from hospitalized patients to symptomatic outpatients and SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms (p < 0.001). Among cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers (p = 0.04), and patients with fever had higher antibody levels than patients without fever (p = 0.001). Pan-SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig in SARS-CoV-2 infection cases significantly increased from first to second follow-up (p < 0.001). A substantial proportion of individuals without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed non-S1-RBD antibody reactivities (248/1159, i.e., 21.4%, 95% CI, 19.1-23.4). In conclusion, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig assay offers favorable and sustained assay characteristics allowing the determination of quantitative associations between clinical characteristics (e.g., disease severity, smoking or fever) and antibody levels. The assay could also help to identify individuals with antibodies of non-S1-RBD specificity with potential clinical cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2.",2020,/,Journal of clinical medicine,9,12,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9123989,33317059,#66566,Schaffner 2020,"",""

So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21-30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/mul; IQR = 40.6-178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5-3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49). We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number., CONCLUSION: This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease.

First wave of COVID-19 did not reach the homeless population in Aarhus.,"Storgaard, Signe Freja; Eiset, Andreas Halgreen; Abdullahi, Farhiya; Wejse, Christian","INTRODUCTION: The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic affecting the whole world. Lower health literacy and higher mortality rates in the homeless and vulnerable population compared with the background population potentially leaves this group or people more exposed to COVID-19. This study assessed the vulnerable population of Aarhus in relation to COVID-19 infection., METHODS: Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed., RESULTS: We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals. On the day of testing, COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, coughing and/or sore throat were found in 63 of 240 (26.3%) of the participants in April and in 26 of 123 (21.1%) in June. In the April testing round, 175 of 291 (59.9%) reported to be born in Denmark. The corresponding number for the June testing round was 84 of 138 (60.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite their vulnerable profile, the vulnerable citizens tested in Aarhus were not infected with COVID-19 at the testing day and very few participants carried antibodies., FUNDING: Testing was funded by Aarhus University Hospital., TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital employees in Italy,Casonato I.; Daperno M.; Guiotto C.; Pagana G.; Norbiato C.; Azzolina M.C.; Rocca R.; Cosseddu D. ,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak early in 2020 overwhelmed the Italian national health system, and hospitals were considered places at high risk of spreading the infection. We explored specific antibody seroprevalence of all employees at a single hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak, to identify risky pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of antibody testing. Method(s): All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). The SARSCoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) is a chemiluminescence immunoassay for quantifying antispike 1 (S1) and anti-spike 2 (S2) IgG on the LIAISON XL automated analyzer; according to the manufacturer, a titer <12 AU/ml is negative, from 12 to 15 is equivocal, and >15 is positive; values below 3.8 are undetectable. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for quantifying anti-capsid IgG on the ARCHITECT i System analyzer; according to the manufacturer, a titer <1.4 is negative and >1.4 is positive. Subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG underwent a confirmatory nasopharyngeal swab PCR test. Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined. Result(s): The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers. Overall, 153 participants (9.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 cases (7.9%) and at least one was positive in 180 cases (11.5%). Factors associated with SARSCoV-2 seropositivity included: Being a smoker, working in Emergency or Medicine Departments, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population of hospital workers was overall about 10%, with an excess prevalence in roles and departments associated with contacts with COVID-19 patients.",2020,/,Biochimica Clinica,44,SUPPL 2,S91,,,633621653,#67571,Casonato 2020,"",""

In our medical center, during a 9-week national lockdown, an alternative school was opened for healthcare workers' (HCW) children with a small number of children per class and strict symptom surveillance. After lockdown was lifted we screened children and their parents for SARS-CoV2 serology., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCW parents and their children after one teacher contracted COVID-19 following exposure at home and 53 children were exposed, isolated and tested by RT-PCR. We compared families with children attending the alternative school to families with children who remained at home during the 9-week lockdown. Epidemiologic and medical data were collected via a short questionnaire; naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and blood was collected for SARS-CoV2 IgA and IgG titres., RESULTS: A total of 435 children attended the Sheba alternative school. Among the 53 children exposed to the infected teacher, none tested positive by RT-PCR. Of these, 18 children-parent pairs were tested for serology and all were negative. A total of 106/435 (24%) children and their 78 parents were recruited for the cross-sectional study; 70 attended the Sheba school and 36 did not. Approximately 16% of children in either group reported symptoms (11/70 in the school group and 6/36 in the 'stay home' group), yet SARS-CoV2 was not detected by PCR in any, and previous exposure, as determined by serological tests, was low and not significantly different between the groups., CONCLUSION: In an alternative school for HCW's children, active during COVID-19 national outbreak, we found no evidence of increased infection compared with children that stayed home.

Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+)., RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure.

Assessing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker groups offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and a higher risk of contagion. The study enrolled 3242 asymptomatic employees of ""Policlinico Riuniti"", Foggia. After the first screening, we collected sequential serum samples for up to 23 weeks from the same subjects. In order to perform a longitudinal follow-up study and get information about the titration of IgG levels, we analyzed data from subjects (33) with at least two consecutive serological IgG-positive tests; 62 (1.9%; 95% CI: 1.4-2.3) tested positive for at least one anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428; 95% CI: 0.5-2.6) vs. the intermediate-risk group 2.0% (55/2736; 95% CI: 1.5-2.5). Overall, within eight weeks, we detected a mean reduction of -17% in IgG levels. Our data suggest a reduction of about 9.27 AU/mL every week (R2 = 0.35, p = 0.0003).

We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020., RESULTS: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689)., CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's. Combining PCR tests (gold standard) with antibodies tests proved useful as a diagnostic strategy. Copyright © 2020 SEGG. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate., METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity)., FINDINGS: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included., INTERPRETATIONS: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran., FUNDING: Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted. Therefore, rapid antibody tests have been suggested as an efficient screening tool during pregnancy., CASES: We analysed the clinical performance during pregnancy of a rapid, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. We performed a universal screening including 169 patients during their last trimester of pregnancy. We present a series of fourteen patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 ICA rapid test result. ICA results were always confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIA) for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies as the gold standard. We observed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 50% in pregnant women, involving a significantly lower diagnostic performance than reported in non-pregnant patients., DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that although ICA rapid tests may be a fast and profitable screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they may have a high false positive rate and low positive predictive value in pregnant women. Therefore, Immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies must be verified by other test in pregnant patients.",2020,/,Annals of clinical biochemistry,,"52y, 0324055",4563220980495,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004563220980495,33242972,#63372,FabreEstremera 2020,"",""

To better understand the persistence of immune response and the proportion of the population who can develop one, the authors assessed patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity over time in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or IgG at a large national reference laboratory. More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages >=55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%).

Results: Swab-positive workers were 0.3%, and subjects with positive serological tests were 1.6% of the total workers examined. Discussion: The diagnostic test is based on the search for viral RNA through nasopharyngeal swab.

COVID-19 prevalence among health-care workers of Gastroenterology department: An audit from a tertiary-care hospital in India,Kumar Goenka M.; Bharat Shah B.; Goenka U.; Das S.S.; Afzalpurkar S.; Mukherjee M.; Patil V.U.; Jajodia S.; Ashokrao Rodge G.; Khan U.; Bandopadhyay S. ,"Background and Aim: In the present coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) era, health-care workers (HCWs) warrant special attention because of their higher risk and potential to transmit the disease. Gastroenterology services include emergency and critical care along with the endoscopy procedures, which have aerosol-generating potential. This study was aimed at auditing the COVID-19 impact on HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department of our hospital. Method(s): The COVID-19 status of 117 HCWs was collected using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroassay. COVID-19 positivity was correlated with demographic characteristics, job profile, area of work, and medical history. Result(s): Thirty-eight HCWs (32.48%) showed evidence of COVID-19 using PCR (23.93%) or only IgG assay (8.55%). Endoscopy technicians (68.75%) exhibited significantly higher (P = 0.003) COVID-19 incidence compared to doctors (20.69%). Those working in the critical care units exhibited a trend toward higher COVID-19 incidence (42.86%). None of the six HCWs who received adequate hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis developed evidence of COVID-19. All the HCWs with COVID-19 disease recovered. However, there was a considerable loss of ""man-days."". Conclusion(s): In our setting, we observed a high COVID-19 risk for HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department, with the highest risk among the endoscopy technicians. A more stringent triaging and pretesting of patients, as well as HCWs, might decrease the risk of COVID-19.

The first U.S. cases were identified in January 2020., METHODS: To determine if SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies were present in sera prior to the first identified case in the U.S. on January 19, 2020, residual archived samples from 7,389 routine blood donations collected by the American Red Cross from December 13, 2019 to January 17, 2020, from donors resident in nine states (California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) were tested at CDC for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Specimens reactive by pan-immunoglobulin (pan Ig) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the full spike protein were tested by IgG and IgM ELISAs, microneutralization test, Ortho total Ig S1 ELISA, and receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity assay., RESULTS: Of the 7,389 samples, 106 were reactive by pan Ig. Of these 106 specimens, 90 were available for further testing. Eighty four of 90 had neutralizing activity, 1 had S1 binding activity, and 1 had receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity >50%, suggesting the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies. Donations with reactivity occurred in all nine states., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced into the United States prior to January 19, 2020.

Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave.,"Vos, Eric R A; den Hartog, Gerco; Schepp, Rutger M; Kaaijk, Patricia; van Vliet, Jeffrey; Helm, Kina; Smits, Gaby; Wijmenga-Monsuur, Alienke; Verberk, Janneke D M; van Boven, Michiel; van Binnendijk, Rob S; de Melker, Hester E; Mollema, Liesbeth; van der Klis, Fiona R M","BACKGROUND: We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave., METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital.,"Insua, Claudia; Stedile, Graciela; Figueroa, Veronica; Hernandez, Claudia; Svartz, Alejandra; Ferrero, Fernando; Ossorio, Maria F; Brunetto, Oscar","INTRODUCTION: In just a few months, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Due to its high infectiousness, the health care staff is even more exposed. Nevertheless, there is still very limited information about it, especially among pediatricians., OBJECTIVE: To assess the seroprevalence of SARSCoV- 2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital 3 months after the first case in Argentina. To explore if certain demographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity., METHODS: Cross-sectional study of physicians randomly selected from the list of workers of a children's hospital. All of them were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by chemiluminescence (immunoglobulins G/M [IgG/IgM]) and their epidemiological history was collected (age, place of residence, professional category, contact with infected people) in order to explore the association between predictors and seropositivity., RESULTS: A total of 116 physicians were included; their average age was 45.6 +/- 13.3 years. Of them, 62.9 % were staff physicians, and the rest, residents; 42.2 % worked in areas designated for direct care of COVID-19 patients. Four (3.5 %) referred contact with infected people without the appropriate protection, and 6 (5.2 %), having traveled to risk areas. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) were only detected in one of the professionals. Because of this, it was impossible to assess the association between potential predictors and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., CONCLUSION: It was observed that only 0.9 % of the physicians from a children's hospital had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions., Objective: To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time., Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020., Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >=65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status., Results: Of 177919 serum samples tested, 103771 (58.3%) were from women, 26716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites., Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction.

Secondarily we aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre during weeks 10 to 19 of 2020, coinciding with the Spanish lockdown. We tested 769 serum samples obtained from routine serological testing during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy for specific IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive)., RESULTS: Seropositivity increased from 0% to 21.4% (95% CI 11.8-31.0) during the study period, of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall outcomes were favorable with a significant increased rate of preterm birth in G4 vs G1 (21.4% vs 6.7%) and cesarean/operative delivery (50% vs 26.9%). Asymptomatic and mild cases did not have differences regarding pregnancy course when compared to seronegative women.

Searching for COVID-19 Antibodies in Czech Children-A Needle in the Haystack,Bloomfield M.; Pospisilova I.; Cabelova T.; Sediva A.; Ibrahimova M.; Borecka K.; Magner M. ,"During the COVID-19 pandemics of 2020, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), both adults and children were shown to mount a specific antibody response to the virus. As infected children often exhibit mild symptoms or even remain asymptomatic, they are likely to be under tested for the direct presence of the virus. Mapping the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies frequency informs more accurately on the disease prevalence and helps guide the protective and therapeutic strategies. To date, only few seroprevalence studies included children. In the Czech Republic, in April 2020, the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was estimated not to exceed 1.3%. In July and August, 2020, we screened 200 children (0-18 years of age), who attended the pediatric department of a large hospital in Prague for various COVID-19-unrelated reasons, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Zero seropositive subjects were found.

Methods All subjects presenting at the major hospital of Milan from May-11 to July-5, 2020, underwent a serological screening by chemiluminescent assays. Those admitted were further tested by RT-PCR. Results The cumulative anti-N IgG seroprevalence in the 2753 subjects analyzed was of 5.1% (95%CI = 4.3%-6.0%), with a peak of 8.4% (6.1%-11.4%) 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses (March-20). 31/106 (29.2%) anti-N reactive subjects had anti-S1/S2 titers >80 AU/mL. Being tested from May-18 to June-5, or residing in the provinces with higher SARS-CoV-2 circulation, were positively and independently associated with anti-N IgG reactivity (OR [95%CI]: 2.179[1.455-3.264] and 3.127[1.18-8.29], respectively).

Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt., METHODS: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data., RESULTS: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing., RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08-0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8-4.1), p < 0.0001., CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine.

Antibody response using six different serological assays in a completely PCR-tested community after a COVID-19 outbreak - The CoNAN study.,"Weis, Sebastian; Scherag, Andre; Baier, Michael; Kiehntopf, Michael; Kamradt, Thomas; Kolanos, Steffi; Ankert, Juliane; Glockner, Stefan; Makarewicz, Oliwia; Hagel, Stefan; Bahrs, Christina; Kimmig, Aurelia; Proquitte, Hans; Guerra, Joel; Rimek, Dagmar; Loffler, Bettina; Pletz, Mathias W; CoNAN study group; Local Cooperation partners","OBJECTIVES: Due to a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses, many SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; ii.) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence., METHODS: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany that was quarantined from March 22nd to April 5th after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the villages' population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compromised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from May 13th to May 22nd 2020 six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak., RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR- and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: Median 2.9 vs. 7.2 IgG-index, p=0.002; DS-assay: Median 45.2 vs. 143 AU/mL, p=0.002). Persisting viral replication was not detected., CONCLUSIONS: Our data question the relevance and reliability of IgG antibody testing to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infections six weeks after an outbreak. We conclude that assessing immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection should not only rely on antibody tests. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The prevalence of acute or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was 9.0 %, including (i) two cases with respiratory symptoms of SARS-Co-V-2 infection and positive RT-PCR; (ii) four asymptomatic women with positive RT-PCR without clinical symptoms and negative serological tests between two and 15 weeks later; and (iii) two women with false positive RT-PCR due to technical problems. All newborns of the 6 pregnant women with RT-PCR positive had negative RT-PCR and did not require Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission. There were eighteen asymptomatic women with positive serological IgG tests and negative RT-PCR., CONCLUSION: In our cohort of gravids, we found 2.2 % of women with positive RT-PRC tests and 6.7 % with positive serological tests during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Health care workers (HCWs) are a well-recognized risk group for COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a nosocomial setting and assess potential risk factors., METHODS: HCWs from two hospitals participated in the study. Hospital-1 was a tertiary university affiliated center, involved in the care of COVID-19 patients while hospital-2 was a tertiary specialized cardiac surgery center not involved in the care of these patients. A validated, CE, rapid, IgM/IgG antibody point-of-care test was used. Comparative performance with a reference globally available assay was assessed., RESULTS: 1,495 individuals consented to participate (response rate 77%). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 weighted prevalence was 1.26% (95% CI 0.43, 3.26) overall and 0.53% (95% CI 0.06, 2.78) and 2.70% (95% CI 0.57, 9.19) in hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively although the study was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences. The overall, hospital-1, and hospital-2 seroprevalence was 10, 4 and 22 times higher than the estimated infection attack rate in general population, respectively.

Concurrently, a transversal study was carried out in patients on active systemic cancer treatment for symptomatology and seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cohort 2)., RESULTS: A total of 215 patients (Cohort 1) were admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between February 28 and April 30, 2020, and 17 died (7.9%). A medical record of cancer was noted in 43 cases (20%), 6 of them required Intensive care unit ICU attention (14%), and 7 died (16%). There were thirty-six patients (83%) who tested IgG/IgM positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies presented a lower ratio of seroconversion (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). In Cohort 2, 166 patients were included in a symptoms-survey and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Any type of potential COVID-19-related symptom was referred up to 67.4% of patients (85.9% vs. 48.2% vs. 73.9%, for patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies respectively, p < 0.05). The seroprevalence ratio was 1.8% for the whole cohort with no significant differences by patient or treatment characteristics., CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer present higher risks for hospital needs for COVID-19 infection.

Overall, among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between May 5 and 15, 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyzer. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables., RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positives for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least 1 symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those resulting seropositive was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was 3-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially of younger age, and/or who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large prospective cohort study of elite football players in Germany (May-June 2020): implications for a testing protocol in asymptomatic individuals and estimation of the rate of undetected cases.,"Mack, Dietrich; Gartner, Barbara Christine; Rossler, Annika; Kimpel, Janine; Donde, Katrin; Harzer, Oliver; Krutsch, Werner; von Laer, Dorothee; Meyer, Tim","OBJECTIVES: Elite professional football players and staff are a unique group that might give insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany and thus can serve as a model for a geographical distribution and an estimation of undetected infections., METHODS: In this prospective cohort study seroprevalence was determined twice in May and June 2020 in players and staff from German Bundesliga. As screening assays a commercial ELISA (Euroimmun) and a CLIA (Roche) was used and an in-house neutralisation assay (NT) as gold standard. Participants were tested twice weekly using PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs., RESULTS: Seroprevalence (NT used as confirmation) in 2,164 samples from 1,184 players and staff was rather similar in May (23/1157 (1.99%)) and in June (21/1007 (2.09%)). All participants were PCR negative during the study period. Significant regional differences in seroprevalence were not observed. When comparing seroprevalence with the cumulative incidence of infections derived from the German notification system (subgroup matching to cohort; men, age: 20-69), IgG was found 8-10 times more frequently, pointing to a high rate of undetected infections. ELISA and CLIA correlated only moderately (Kappa 0.52)., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence with high quality diagnostic in Germany seemed to be around 2%. The number of undetected infections seems to be 8-10 times higher than notification data. Quality of antibody assays is rather variable, thus results should ideally be confirmed at least by a second assay to prove IgG positivity.

Prospective Sero-epidemiological Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in a German Secondary Care Hospital,Herzberg J.; Vollmer T.; Fischer B.; Becher H.; Becker A.-K.; Sahly H.; Honarpisheh H.; Guraya S.Y.; Strate T.; Knabbe C. ,"Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the pulmonary disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, which has challenged health care facilities worldwide. The sustainability of health care systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study aimed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. Method(s): Between March and June 2020, we used a combination of RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital based on repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPSs) and blood samples. Result(s): In total, 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPSs and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in three participants (0.34%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. Conclusion(s): Our study determined a low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. However, it could also indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees.

Las pruebas combinadas de IgM e IgG rapidas pueden tener un papel importante en la vigilancia de la COVID-19 y en su diagnostico, asi como en la evaluacion de la respuesta inmunologica y la verificacion de los avances hacia la inmunidad de rebano. Objetivo. Evaluar el desempeno de las pruebas rapidas de anticuerpos en la vigilancia ocupacional de la COVID-19 en un grupo de empresas colombianas. Materiales y metodos. Se usaron datos de la vigilancia ocupacional de empresas que hicieron pruebas serologicas periodicas a todo el personal desde finales de abril hasta comienzos de julio de 2020. Los trabajadores laboraban en grupos pequenos (""burbujas sociales"") para evitar brotes y optimizar la vigilancia. La sensibilidad se estimo como si el muestreo respondiera a un diseno prospectivo. Se describieron, asimismo, los cambios en las pruebas serologicas por medio de rondas periodicas. Resultados. Se obtuvieron datos de 4.740 trabajadores, de los cuales solo 23 eran sintomaticos. En ellos se evidenciaron cambios de IgM(-)/IgG(-) a IgM(+), y luego a IgM(+)/IgG(+) e IgG(+). La sensibilidad fue de 40,94 % para las IgM(+) y 47,95 % para las IgM(+)/IgG(+), lo que implica que se pudo detectar un poco menos de la mitad de los casos. Conclusion. Las pruebas rapidas de anticuerpos tienen un papel en el proceso diagnostico de la infeccion y deben evaluarse teniendo en cuenta el momento de la epidemia, el tipo de prueba comprada y las poblaciones de riesgo, dado que sus resultados dependen del numero de contagios y de casos.

We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission., METHODS: We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22-April 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test., RESULTS: Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4-106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2-42.5)., CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts. People with COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care to promptly self-isolate to prevent household transmission.

Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-specific Antibodies in German Blood Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic,Runkel S.; Kowalzik F.; Gehring S.; Winter J.; Grandt C.L.; Marron M.; Seifert-Hitzler S.; Hitzler W.E. ,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. METHOD(S): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULT(S): Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide.

Orthogonal SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays Enable Surveillance of Low-Prevalence Communities and Reveal Durable Humoral Immunity,Ripperger T.J.; Uhrlaub J.L.; Watanabe M.; Wong R.; Castaneda Y.; Pizzato H.A.; Thompson M.R.; Bradshaw C.; Weinkauf C.C.; Bime C.; Erickson H.L.; Knox K.; Bixby B.; Parthasarathy S.; Chaudhary S.; Natt B.; Cristan E.; El Aini T.; Rischard F.; Campion J.; Chopra M.; Insel M.; Sam A.; Knepler J.L.; Capaldi A.P.; Spier C.M.; Dake M.D.; Edwards T.; Kaplan M.E.; Scott S.J.; Hypes C.; Mosier J.; Harris D.T.; LaFleur B.J.; Sprissler R.; Nikolich-Zugich J.; Bhattacharya D. ,"We conducted a serological study to define correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Compared to those with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated virus-neutralizing titers and antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Age and sex played lesser roles. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks after PCR confirmation. Spike RBD and S2 and neutralizing antibodies remained detectable through 5-7 months after onset, whereas alpha-N titers diminished. Testing 5,882 members of the local community revealed only 1 sample with seroreactivity to both RBD and S2 that lacked neutralizing antibodies. This fidelity could not be achieved with either RBD or S2 alone. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low-seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 exposures are challenging due to poor positive predictive values. Ripperger et al. show that the combinatorial use of spike receptor binding domain and S2 eliminates almost all false positives. This serological assay is used to show durable antibody production for at least 5-7 months after infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,/,Immunity,53,5,925,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.10.004,2008450253,#53119,Ripperger 2020,"",""

Method(s): Retrospective study of patients hospitalized with PCR+ for COVID-19 to assess the rate of cancer patients and describe clinical, pathological characteristics and evolution of their disease. In addition, a transversal study of seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Sars-Cov-2 is being carried out in patients undergoing active treatment. Immunophenotype analysis will be performed for patients with IgG/IgM+ test and a cohort of patients with negative test that will be used as controls. Result(s): 581 patients with mild to severe COVID-19 and PCR+ have been admitted at the Arnau Vilanova University Hospital in Valencia, Spain. A total of 18 patients had medical history of cancer (3%). 72% were male and median age was 76 years. Most frequent cancers were breast (16,7%), colon (16,7%) and bladder (16,7%). Fourteen had been treated for an early stage and were disease free at the time of the COVID-19 (83,3%). Three patients were on active systemic therapy: 2 chemotherapy (1 on neoadjuvant treatment for bladder cancer, 1 on chemo-radiotherapy for stage III NSCLC, and 1 with adjuvant Imatinib for GIST). One patient with advanced hepatocarcinoma was on palliative treatment. Most frequent symptoms were dyspnoea (66,7%), cough (66,7%), fever (66,7%), asthenia (44,4%) and diarrhea (16,7%). Four patients (22,2%) required Intensive Care and six (33,3%) died. Preliminary results of first 86 ambulatory patients on active treatment evaluated for seroprevalence against Sars-Cov-2 reveal a 0% of IgG or IgM antibodies. Conclusion(s): Rate of cancer patients admitted in hospital with COVID-19 infection was 3%.

Retrospective single cohort study on patients with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic Healthcare Workers, enrolled from March to April 2020. Subjects had quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab and serological testing using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay. Some subjects underwent chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) after rapid test. The aim of the study was to analyse the proportion of those who developed a positive IgM/IgG response for SARS-CoV-2. The correspondence between the results from rapid testing and CLIA, when available, was evaluated. 97 subjects underwent qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 through nasal swab, which resulted positive in 40/43 (93.0%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of asymptomatic HCW, in no subjects with suspected COVID-19 (clinical and radiological findings) then excluded by repeated nasal swabs and alternative diagnosis (COVID-19-negative patients, CNPs), and in 6/6 (100%) of patients with confirmed diagnosis and negative follow-up nasal swabs (COVID-19-recovered patients, CRPs). IgM resulted positive in 8/43 (18.6%) of symptomatic patients and in 1/6 (16.7%) of CRPs. IgG resulted positive in 36/43 (83.7%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of HCW, and in 1/8 (12.5%) and 6/6 (100%) of CNPs and CRPs, respectively. A comparison between an IgG/IgM Rapid Test and a following CLIA test showed consistency in negative results in 25/28 of HCW and 8/8 of CNPs tested. Our preliminary data support the role of IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay as a point-of-care test that may complement molecular tests in the screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The test may gain particular relevance in shortening the time needed to refer patients to a COVID or non-COVID Hospital area and to achieve diagnosis in patients with persistently negative nasal swabs.",2020,/,The new microbiologica,43,4,,,,633320026,#54936,Canetti 2020,"",""

Performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in the occupational surveillance of COVID-19 in Colombian enterprises.,"Idrovo, Alvaro J; Moreno-Montoya, Jose; Pinzon-Florez, Carlos E","Introduction: Rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests can play an important role in the COVID-19 surveillance by supporting the diagnosis of infection, assessing the immune response, and verifying the progress towards herd immunity. Objective: To evaluate the performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in COVID-19 occupational surveillance in a group of Colombian enterprises. Materials and methods: We used the occupational surveillance data from companies that had performed periodic serological tests on all personnel from the end of April to the beginning of July, 2020. Workers were organized in small groups (""social bubbles"") to prevent outbreaks and optimize surveillance. The sensitivity was estimated as if the sampling had a prospective design. We describe here the changes in serological testing through periodic rounds. Results: Data were obtained from 4,740 workers, of whom only 23 were symptomatic showing changes from IgM(-)/IgG(-) to IgM(+) and then to IgM(+)/IgG(+) and IgG(+). The sensitivity was 40.94% for IgM(+) and 47.95% for IgM(+)/IgG(+). This implies that a little less than half of the cases can be detected. Conclusion: Antibody rapid tests have a role in the diagnostic process of infection and they must be evaluated taking into account the moment of the epidemic, the type of test purchased, and the populations at risk since their results depend on the number of infections and cases.

Overall, 681 nasopharyngeal swabs and 667 blood samples were collected. Only one resident of the village resulted in being positive for RNA viral shedding, while 73 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall seroprevalence was 10.9%.

Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike versus Nucleoprotein Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies,Fenwick C.; Croxatto A.; Coste A.T.; Pojer F.; Andre C.; Pellaton C.; Farina A.; Campos J.; Hacker D.; Lau K.; Bosch B.-J.; Gonseth Nussle S.; Bochud M.; D'Acremont V.; Trono D.; Greub G.; Pantaleo G. ,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to the Spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n=93) and in individuals enrolled in a post-infection seroprevalence population study (n=578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.Copyright © 2020 Fenwick et al.",2020,/,Journal of virology,,"(Fenwick, Andre, Pellaton, Farina, Campos) Service of Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland(Croxatto, Coste) Institute of Microbiology, Lausanne University Hospital a",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01828-20,633341792,#54540,Fenwick 2020,"",""

"SARS-COV-2 HERD IMMUNITY, INFECTIVE AND NAIVE INCIDENCE IN FERTILITY CLINICS AFTER PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN. A MULTICENTER STUDY",Foulk R.A.; Sakkas D.; Kayali R.; Valbuena D.; Simon C.; Cuzzi J. ,"Objective: COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March, 2020 and lockdown was imposed to a third of the world's population. Now, determining the transmission potential and immune status among sheltering in place asymptomatic patients and clinical staff resuming their activity is crucial. Here, we report herd immunity, infective, and naive incidence for SARS-CoV-2 after the lockdown period, among asymptomatic medical personnel and patients in two US ART centers located in states with different COVID19 incidences. Design(s): Prospective multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466644). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 339 asymptomatic individuals (personnel and patients) were analyzed from June 18 to July 30, 2020 in two ART centers reopening after lockdown following CDC safety guidelines. In Clinic A (Utah Fertility Center), located in a low prevalence State (312 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 154 individuals were analyzed. In clinic B (Boston IVF), in a high prevalence scenario (Massachusetts, 1,462 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 185 individuals were tested. Asymptomatic individuals attending or working in the indicated clinics were tested by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and for IgG quantification on blood samples (Abbott Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), following FDA-Emergency Use Authorization protocols. IRB approval was obtained from WIRB Protocol #20201490. Result(s): From 339 asymptomatic individuals tested, the percentage of non-informativity was 0 for RT-PCR and 0.6% (2 out of 339) for the IgG test. Only those individuals with informative results for both tests (n= 337) are presented. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): In the population investigated, our results suggest that the impact of the pandemic is far from reaching the level required to achieve herd immunity (i.e., 50% of a population). Therefore, transmission remains a risk since potential infectivity is present in 0.6% of the asymptomatic population tested. This figure was maintained despite their different geographical locations and the adherence to CDC guidelines of the IVF clinics involved. Interestingly, the two PCR+ individuals were IgG + suggesting virus persistence or reinfection that, if tested by serology alone, would be considered immune. These results together with the high incidence of naive individuals draws attention for the implementation of a consistent program of testing for COVID19 as a means of preventing reemerging outbreaks in our fertility centers.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Fertility and Sterility,114,3 Supplement,e539,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.069,2008033858,#44146,Foulk 2020,"",""

COVID-19 seropositivity and asymptomatic rates in healthcare workers are associated with job function and masking.,"Sims, Matthew D; Maine, Gabriel N; Childers, Karen Lins; Podolsky, Robert H; Voss, Daniel R; Berkiw-Scenna, Natalie; Oh, Joyce; Heinrich, Kevin E; Keil, Hans; Kennedy, Richard H; Homayouni, Ramin; BLAST COVID-19 Study Group","BACKGROUND: Although the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is higher for frontline healthcare workers, not all personnel have similar risks. Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment., METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay., RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive. Additionally, a large proportion of seropositive employees self-reported as asymptomatic.

Estimates of the rate of infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease in a population sample from SE England,Wells P.M.; Doores K.J.; Couvreur S.; Nunez R.M.; Seow J.; Graham C.; Acors S.; Kouphou N.; Neil S.J.D.; Tedder R.S.; Matos P.M.; Poulton K.; Lista M.J.; Dickenson R.E.; Sertkaya H.; Maguire T.J.A.; Scourfield E.J.; Bowyer R.C.E.; Hart D.; O'Bryne A.; Steel K.J.A.; Hemmings O.; Rosadas C.; McClure M.O.; Capedevilla-Pujol J.; Wolf J.; Ourselin S.; Brown M.A.; Malim M.H.; Spector T.; Steves C.J. ,"BACKGROUND: Understanding of the true asymptomatic rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited, as is understanding of the population-based seroprevalence after the first wave of COVID-19 within the UK. The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. METHOD(S): We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. FINDINGS: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study. Anosmia demonstrated the highest symptom specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. FUNDING: NIHR BRC, CDRF, ZOE global LTD, RST-UKRI/MRC.Copyright © 2020.

Seroprevalence of COVID-19 Amongst Health Care Workers in a Tertiary Care Hospital of a Metropolitan City from India.,"Goenka, Mahesh; Afzalpurkar, Shivaraj; Goenka, Usha; Das, Sudipta Sekhar; Mukherjee, Mohuya; Jajodia, Surabhi; Shah, Bhavik Bharat; Patil, Vikram Uttam; Rodge, Gajanan; Khan, Ujjwayini; Bandyopadhyay, Syamasis","Background: Seroprevalence studies for COVID-19 evaluate the extent of undetected transmission in a defined community, with special significance among health care workers (HCW) owing to their greater exposure and potential to transmit., Methods: A total of 1122 HCW (approximately 25% of the employees) of a large tertiary care hospital in India were recruited for this cross-sectional study. COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence., Results: The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p < 0.0001). HCW with a history of BCG vaccination in childhood and those who received an adequate prophylactic dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had a lower seroprevalence as compared to those who did not (7.31% vs. 16.8% and 1.30% vs. 11.25% respectively)., Conclusion: BCG vaccination, HCQ prophylaxis, and the job profile influence the seroprevalence rate in HCW. Seroprevalence rate and follow-up evaluation of its durability may help hospitals to triage their staff at risk, rationalize their placement, prioritize the use of PPE, thereby potentially reducing the risk.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Health Care Workers in a New York City Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Analysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Venugopal U.; Jilani N.; Rabah S.; Shariff M.A.; Jawed M.; Batres A.M.; Abubacker M.; Menon S.; Pillai A.; Shabarek N.; Kasubhai M.; Dimitrov V.; Menon V. ,"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a greater number of infections cases, hospitalisations and mortality. Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at high-risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from a NYC public hospital. METHOD(S): Cross sectional study including serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. RESULT(S): A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge.Copyright © 2020.

Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1,019 women with a double test taken between Feb. 17 and Apr. 23, 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between Apr. 14 and May 21, 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving approximately 12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 18) versus negative (n = 994) (p = 0.62). There was no significant increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with positive antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, p = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection., WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significant increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning Covid-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies.

In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors., FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (96.8%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 5.9% (95% CI 4.9-7.1) for 1779 household contacts, 1.3% (0.9-1.9) for 2231 work contacts, and 1.3% (1.0-1.7) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 5.38 [95% CI 1.82-15.84]; p=0.0023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (7.86 [3.86-16.02]; p<0.0001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 3.92 [95% CI 2.07-7.40], p<0.0001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (2.67 [1.21-5.88]; p=0.015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (3.07 [1.55-6.08]; p=0.0013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission., INTERPRETATION: Targeted community measures should include physical distancing and minimising verbal interactions.

The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya was reported on March 12, 2020 and an overwhelming number of cases and deaths were expected but by July 31, 2020 there were only 20,636 cases and 341 deaths. However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community remains unknown. We determined the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among blood donors in Kenya in April-June 2020.

Working at the front line, emergency department (ED) HCWs are uniquely at high risk. It is unknown if seropositivity in this population is similar to community levels or is substantially higher as a result of work-based exposure to infectious children who may demonstrate mild symptoms. Further, the experience of pediatric HCWs may be disparate from adult focused facilities because prior to implementation of social distancing, children presented for care at pediatric facilities in high numbers with mild illness. Many were evaluated in pediatric EDs which may have put pediatric HCWs at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic before universal personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization became standard practice. The milder nature of COVID-19 in children has also led some to believe that children are not affected, although the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refutes this notion. However, this belief and the lack of data may result in lax utilization to PPE in pediatric settings. Data describing seropositivity among pediatric HCWs is not yet available. Study Objective: Determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric HCWs. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing data from the baseline visit of a prospective cohort to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs at a large pediatric health care facility in April-May 2020. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and level of anxiety about COVID-19 was determined. Symptomatic or febrile HCWs were excluded. Metrics were analyzed overall and by HCW roles and tested for differences using chi-square estimates of independence. Prevalence of IgG antibodies were compared in ED vs. non-ED HCWs. Result(s): Of 300 HCWs enrolled from April 16-May 18, 2020, their mean age range is 41-50 years, 83% are female and 75% have no comorbidities. HCWs include 33% physicians, 25% nurses 10% respiratory therapists, 7% advance practice providers, and 25% other. Forty-seven percent were emergency department (ED) staff, 13% worked in pediatric intensive care, 40% elsewhere. Half of all HCWs had children in their home, 45% had traveled outside the state, and 47% reported an illness since January. Overall, 28% had a known COVID-19+ exposure. Most participants (90%) believed they were at high risk to develop COVID-19 as HCWs, and 70% reported high anxiety due to the pandemic. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in this cohort is 4.7%. Of the 14 HCWs with positive serology, only 3 (21%) had a history of any prior COVID-19 testing, all of which were positive; 43% (6/14) had no prior flu-like illness or symptoms. Eighty-six percent of antibody-positive HCWs were ED-based staff; SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 9% of ED HCWs enrolled compared to 1% in non-ED based HCWs, p=0.003. Conclusion(s): Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is low in pediatric HCWs living in a region with high COVID-19 activity. Most cases were found in HCWs from the pediatric ED, and nearly half were asymptomatic. ED-based pediatric HCWs may be uniquely at higher risk of exposure to children with COVID-19, and particularly may have been at higher risk of infection before awareness of the evolving pandemic; ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Annals of Emergency Medicine,76,4 Supplement,S124-S125,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.336,2008409942,#55578,Morris 2020,"",""

Here, we examined 217 recovered COVID-19 patients to assess their viral RNA shedding and residual antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. We found that viral RNA remained detectable in 6.6% of recovered COVID-19 cases and up to 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.8%, 88.5%, and 83.4% of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Higher levels of antibodies detected were associated with severe illness patients experienced while hospitalized. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.9%) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies, suggesting probable exposure.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19., METHODS: Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics., RESULTS: Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset., CONCLUSIONS: In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.",2020,/,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",,"9716844, qja",33354920966064,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033354920966064,33108976,#49699,McPherson 2020,Mairead Whelan (2020-12-14 15:29:14)(Select): can extract data on high exposure group; ,""

We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland in the spring of 2020 to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.AimOur objective was to determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Results All samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5-6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic.

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers.,"Noval Rivas, Magali; Ebinger, Joseph E; Wu, Min; Sun, Nancy; Braun, Jonathan; Sobhani, Kimia; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Cheng, Susan; Arditi, Moshe","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over one million deaths worldwide, thus there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs)., METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion., RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion., CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection., FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (U54 CA26059) and the Erika J.

The application of point of care serological testing can help determine past infection and assist healthcare workers assess patient risk. Method: An observational study of 114 subjects in North Suburban Chicago, Illinois, was performed using the Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). Patients' PCR test results and clinical symptoms were used to compare the seroconversion rate of this patient population with the surrounding community. Results: Excluding 1 aberrant result, there was 100% positive agreement (10) between PCR and antibody (IgG or IgM) test results. There were 7 patients who did not have a prior PCR test who were positive for IgG; 5 of the 7 had clinical symptoms consistent with possible exposure and 2 were asymptomatic. There was 1 person with a suspected exposure to an infected person who was IgM positive. Ninety-five asymptomatic patients were seronegative. The overall rate of 15.9% seroconversion (IgG or IgM) is consistent with other community-based testing results in the North Suburban Chicago, Illinois area.

A serological survey was done at some of these locations to assess the COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group., METHODS: We did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Medecins Sans Frontieres in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test. Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms., FINDINGS: Between June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites. Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site (chi2 p<0.0001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (88.7%, 95% CI 81.8-93.2), followed by emergency shelters (50.5%, 46.3-54.7), and food distribution sites (27.8%, 20.8-35.7). More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 64.2-72.2; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among US Navy personnel deployed on the USNS COMFORT to augment the inpatient health care capacity in New York City., Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on USNS COMFORT crewmembers returning to Norfolk, Virginia, following deployment. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire and provided a serum sample at Day 14 post-deployment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from testing of symptomatic crewmembers during deployment and Day 0 and Day 14 post-deployment screening swabs conducted on all crewmembers, per military order, were abstracted. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein immunoglobulin G antibody or PCR result., Results: Of the ship's total complement of 1200 crewmembers, 450 were enrolled: 432 (96.0%) completed the questionnaire and provided a serum sample. The median age of participants (interquartile range) was 30 (24-39) years, 50.8% were female, 58.6% were White, and 14.0% were Black; 80.1% had a clinical role during deployment. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 3.01% (13/432; 95% CI, 1.61%-5.09%). Twelve of 13 infections occurred in health care providers, and 8 of 13 were asymptomatic.

It has created a devastating effect on humanity with social and economic depressions. Europe and America were the hardest hit continents. India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases.

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM/IgA) were measured in all participants and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was performed at delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative women: miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small-for-gestational age, neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome plus abnormal fetal growth, malformation, intrapartum fetal distress. Outcomes were also compared between positive symptomatic and positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 women., RESULTS: Of 2,225 pregnant women, 317 (14.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=314, 99.1%) and/or RT-PCR (n=36, 11.4%). Among positive women, 217 (68.5%) were asymptomatic, 93 (29.3%) had mild COVID-19 and 7 (2.2%) pneumonia, of which 3 required intensive care unit admission. In women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, the primary outcome occurred in 43 (13.6%) and 268 (14%), respectively [risk difference -0.4%, (95% CI: -4.1% to 4.1)]. As compared with non-infected women, women with symptomatic COVID-19 had increased rates of preterm delivery (7.2% vs. 16.9%, p=0.003) and intrapartum fetal distress (9.1% vs. 19.2%, p=0.004), while asymptomatic women had similar rates to non-infected cases.

Asymptomatic health care worker cohorts had a combined swab positivity rate of 29/5776 (0.50%, 95%CI 0.32-0.75) relative to a comparative cohort of symptomatic HCWs, where 54/1597 (3.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic 6.8:1). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among 996 asymptomatic HCWs with no prior known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4-3.4%, depending on assay.

The objectives of this study were to assess SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, individual exposure risk factors and compliance of HCWs to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). After the first nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak at JUH, mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We evaluated point seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays and issued a questionnaire to assess COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Antibody retesting was offered to participants with a divergent result of both immunoassays 5-10 weeks after the first test. Between 19th May and 19th June 2020, we analyzed 660 participants [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Among them, 212 participants (32.1%) had received a previous COVID-19 test. Four of them (1.9%) reported a positive test result. After recruitment, 18 participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Overall, 21 participants (3.2%) had any evidence of a past or current SARS CoV-2 infection. Among them, 13 (61.9%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (42.9%) did not report any clinical symptoms. COVID-19 exposure at home (adjusted OR (aOR) with 95% CI: 47.82 (5.49, 416.62)) was associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and exposure at work (aOR 0.48 (0.13, 1.70)) or with COVID-19 risk area according to the working place (aOR for intermediate-risk versus high-risk: 1.97 (0.42, 9.22), aOR for low-risk versus high-risk: 2.10 (0.40, 11.06); p=0.655). Reported compliance of HCWs to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). In conclusion, compared to administration staff, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE.

"Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the 2020 pandemic year in the population of the city of Tirana, Albania","Sulcebe, Genc; Ylli, Alban; Cenko, Fabian; Kurti-Prifti, Margarita","<h4>Introduction: </h4> While the identification of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been used to measure the hidden circulation of the COVID-19 in communities, there are few publications on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during both waves of 2020. This study provides original data about the change in proportion of individuals showing immune response to COVID-19 between beginning of July and end of December 2020. <h4>Methods:</h4> The study was conducted in two rounds, 27 June -3 July, and 21-28 December 2020, using two independently selected samples of individuals 20-70 years old. Study participants were randomly selected from lists of the inhabitants of the catchment communities of four primary health care centers in Tirana City. Serological testing was performed by an ELISA method which determines IgG class antibodies anti S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The validity of the method was tested in a sample of blood donors sera of 2018. <h4>Results:</h4> The proportion of individuals classified as seropositive during the first round, in early July was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.3% - 10.7%). The proportion rose sharply in the second round, by late December 2020, reaching 48.2% (95% CI: 44.8% - 51.7%). The same increasing pattern was observed in all studied categories. No statistical significance was found between men and women and between age categories. The prevalence of seropositive individuals was always significantly higher among those who reported symptoms and those who had done the molecular test. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The ratio of total infected cases over confirmed cases was estimated to be higher than 10 to 1 in Albania. The rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence observed in Tirana City may have been facilitated by a number of factors, including the very low infection exposure during the period March - May 2020, and the consecutive high susceptibility in population. Despite the observed high seroprevalence, one month after the study, COVID-19 incidence continued to increase in Tirana.",2021,,,,,,PPR286472,10.1101/2021.02.18.21251776,,#82323,Sulcebe 2021,"",""

The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied., OBJECTIVES: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates., STUDY DESIGN: Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welch's two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welch's two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels., RESULTS: Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies. Copyright © 2021.

However, data on the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with kidney disease is limited, and the utility of an LFIA to test for antibodies in these patients has not been assessed., Study Design: Observational study., Setting & Participants: 60 patients (40 hemodialysis and 20 kidney transplant recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and 88 historic negative-control samples (collected before September 2019)., Test: A commercially available LFIA to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with infection confirmed by viral RT-PCR testing., Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG in dialysis patients and transplant recipients., Results: 56/58 (96.6%) patients (38/39 hemodialysis and 18/19 transplant recipients) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 5/7 (71.4%) patients who were negative on preliminary testing had detectable IgG when retested more than 21 days postdiagnosis. Median times to first and second tests after diagnosis were 17 (interquartile range, 15-20) and 35 (interquartile range, 30-39) days, respectively. Calculation of test characteristics gave sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI, 88.3%-99.4%) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 92.0-99.6%)., Limitations: Possible exposure to other beta-coronaviruses that may cross-react with the antigen used in the LFIA cannot be excluded., Conclusions: Symptomatic dialysis patients and transplant recipients commonly develop an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected using an LFIA. Used diligently, an LFIA could be used to help screen the dialysis populations or confirm exposure on a patient level, especially in facilities in which laboratory resources are limited.

Serology in COVID: Light the Lantern and Pave the Way to Unexplored...,Ramanathan S. ,"International Guidelines have voted for PCR as the Gold Standard in COVID diagnosis. Nasoparyngeal swab is the preferred specimen for PCR. It has a high probability of diagnosing early infection. But the diagnostic sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR decreases with increase in lapse between the infection and presentation to hospital. This might lead to dire consequences of labelling these patients as false negative, though such patients have been proved to be potentially infective since viral shedding occurs through other body fluids (stools) for long. COVID infection reveals that the IgM antibodies start to appear as early as 5th day of infection and switches over to IgA within 2-3 days. The aim of the study was to see if COVID antibody testing be coupled with PCR for diagnosis especially in patients presenting late (more than 14 days) of onset of infection?

Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence and severity of COVID- 19 infection in the NMOSD/MOGAD population in Italy and evaluate possibily risk factors for disease outcomes. Method(s): The MS Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society has set up a proactive programme to provide information about COVID-19 in NMOSD/MOGAD patients, using a semistructured survey. Result(s): 569 NMOSD/MOGAD patients from 40 Italian MS Centres have been censored for COVID-19. 68% (387/569) of the patients were treated with rituximab, 16% (91/569) with azathioprine, 4.4% (25/569) with tocilizumab, 5.4% (31/569) with other therapies and 6.2% (35/569) were untreated or without information. 8/569 patients (1.4%) were diagnosed having confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19: positive rhino-pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were found in 4 out of 6 tested patients. At the time of data collection, 6 patients recovered, 1 was still hospitalised and, unfortunately, 1 died. Hospitalisation was required for 3 patients. 5/8 (68%) patients were treated with rituximab.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children from a cohort of 2192 patients,Meyer M.; Rubsteck E.; Lehmann C.; Klein F.; Gruell H.; Hunseler C.; Weber L.T. ,"Background: As of 18 June 2020 a total of 187,764 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were reported in Germany and of these 6.9% were under the age of 19 years. There were initial indications that children are often asymptomatic and show a milder clinical course. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to gain information on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a pediatric cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 13 March and 18 June 2020 all children from whom a smear for SARS-CoV-2 was taken either to rule out an infection or as a suspected case were included. Data were collected on standardized patient record sheets. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Result(s): During the given period 2192 children were investigated and 37 patients tested positive (1.7%) for SARS-CoV-2. Of these 36/37 were suspected cases and 28/37 were symptomatic. The leading symptoms were dry cough, runny nose and fever and three children had to be hospitalized. None showed a difficult course of the disease. Among those tested 505 were patients at risk due to an underlying chronic disease, 3 of whom (0.6%) were tested positive with an asymptomatic or mild course. Conclusion(s): We can confirm the first data showing that children and adolescents often have an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of infection or disease. We found no evidence of a high grey area of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this regional pediatric cohort.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2021,/,Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde,169,1,46-51,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00112-020-01067-8,2007331168,#78269,Meyer 2021,"",""

Non-Congruent SARS-CoV-2 Waves in England,"Brookes, Anthony; Pollock, Allyson; Dorling, Danny","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Examination of the chronology, location and size of waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection across England could shed light on the inter-play between the 1 st and the 2 nd Waves. From mid-October onwards such an analysis becomes increasingly difficult due to the emergence of a new strain (VOC-202012/01) and in light of the differential implementation of lockdown measures and tiers. Therefore, we sought to examine trends and correlations in virus prevalence and covid-related deaths spanning the start of the UK pandemic in March 2020 through to early November 2020 – i.e., including the first growth period of the 2 nd Wave. We found striking regional relationships between the 1 st and the 2 nd Wave that are difficult to explain other than by involving some role for changing levels of immunity in the population affecting the progression of the pandemic.",2021,,,,,,PPR273677,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250440,,#77274,Brookes 2021,"",""
First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua.,"Huete-Perez, Jorge A; Cabezas-Robelo, Cristiana; Paiz-Medina, Lucia; Hernandez-Alvarez, Carlos A; Quant-Duran, Carlos; McKerrow, James H","The Nicaraguan COVID-19 situation is exceptional for Central America. The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis' effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects' COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",2021,/,PloS one,16,1,e0246084,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246084,33503071,#75692,Huete-Perez 2021,"",""
Clinical Features of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hemodialysis Patients.,"Pizarro-Sanchez, Maria Soledad; Avello, Alejandro; Mas-Fontao, Sebastian; Stock da Cunha, Teresa; Goma-Garces, Elena; Pereira, Monica; Ortiz, Alberto; Gonzalez-Parra, Emilio","BACKGROUND: CKD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized., OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients., METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed., RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common in hemodialysis patients, especially among patients with initial negative PCR that later seroconvert. Thus COVID-19 mortality in hemodialysis patients may be lower than previously estimated based on PCR tests alone. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

Characteristics of COVID-19 infection and antibody formation in a Tertiary Immunology department.,"Guchelaar, N A D; van Laar, J A M; Hermans, M A W; van der Houwen, T B; Atmaca, S; van Maaren, M S; Brkic, Z; van Daele, P L A; Dalm, V A S H; van Hagen, P M; Rombach, S M","Background: Knowledge about COVID-19 infections is expanding, although knowledge about the disease course and antibody formation in patients with an auto-immune disease or immunodeficiency is not fully unraveled yet. It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state., Methods: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands., Results: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder., Conclusion: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients was shown. More research needs to be conducted to confirm these observations and guidelines regarding (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs in COVID-19 positive immunocompromised patients should be developed.

Study Design: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of pregnant women delivering at a single institution in NYC who were universally tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or serology from March 13 to August 5, 2020. Women were classified by self-reported race/ethnicity into five groups - non-Hispanic Black (""Black""), non-Hispanic White (""White""), Hispanic, Asian and ""other"". Data on baseline characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 presentation and outcomes, and perinatal outcomes were collected and examined across groups of race/ethnicity in SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected women using Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. The odds ratios (OR) for SARS-CoV-2 positivity and cesarean delivery were determined by logistic regression models with adjustment for demographic, medical and obstetric factors. Result(s): Of 2489 women who delivered, 1338 (53.8%) were Hispanic, 531 (21.3%) White, 252 (10.1%) Black, 127 (5.1%) Asian and 241 (9.7%) ""other"". The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 11.1% (n=276). There was a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among Hispanic women compared to White women (15.6% vs 6.0%, p<=0.01), which persisted after controlling for confounders (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.05, 4.27). The infection rate did not differ significantly among other racial/ethnic groups compared to White women. (Table 1) Hispanic and Black women were more likely to undergo cesarean (51% and 39% vs 28 %, p<=0.05), which persisted in Hispanic women after controlling for SARS-CoV-2 infection and confounders (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.30, 9.80), but not in Black women. There were no differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated outcomes or other perinatal complications. (Table 2) Conclusion(s): Hispanic women were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 in this population and were more likely to undergo cesarean compared to SARS-CoV-2-infected White women.

Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) within 3 weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19. Patients and methods: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled (i) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; (ii) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and (iii) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology health care professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. Results: From 30 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively.

Extremely low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Israeli hospitals: a cross-sectional study,"Temkin, E.; Healthcare Worker, Covid-Surveil","Objectives: We aimed to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among clinical staff in designated COVID-19 units versus that among staff in similar units with no known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) in eight Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. Results: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unitdtested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. Conclusions: The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCWs, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCWs.

"SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in asymptomatic frontline health workers in Ibadan, Nigeria",Olayanju O.; Bamidele O.; Edem F.; Eseile B.; Amoo A.; Nwaokenye J.; Udeh C.; Oluwole G.; Odok G.; Awah N. ,"Global health has been thrown into turmoil by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused devastating morbidity and unprecedented loss of life in almost all continents of the world. It was predicted that the magnitude of the pandemic in Africa will be high because of poor health structure and intensely poor living condition, but that has not happened, surprisingly. It was hypothesized that the youthful population and a vastly primed immune system were protective, and many people may have been exposed without coming down with the severe disease. Most of them would have presented in hospitals with other medical conditions and possibly transmit COVID-19 to health workers inadvertently. This study is designed to measure serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in health workers as a marker of latent exposure. Asymptomatic frontline health workers were randomly selected from the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria; venous blood samples were obtained from them, and the serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was determined using ELISA techniques. A proportion of participants with seropositivity were obtained, and factors associated with seropositivity were determined. A total of 133 participants were recruited for this study, and 60 (45.1%) of them were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the seropositive participants were doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory scientists and technicians, and nonmedical staff. Obstetrics, gynecology, and emergency departments had higher odds of seropositivity. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is very high among frontline health workers, though asymptomatic.

Understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient, particularly in relation to those whose responses persist for more than 1 month after the onset of symptoms. We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to identify factors affecting the serological response and to evaluate its diagnostic utility in patients with COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We collected 1,048 residual serum samples from 396 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The samples had been used for routine admission tests in six healthcare institutions in Daegu. Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed and the cutoff index (COI) was calculated for quantitative analysis. The patients&rsquo; information was reviewed to evaluate the relationship between antibody positivity and clinical characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate was 85% and the average COI was 24&middot;3. The positivity rate and COI increased with time elapsed since symptom onset. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks after symptom onset at a high COI. There was a significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between patients with and without symptoms, but not according to sex or disease course. The descending COI pattern at weeks 1 to 5 after symptom onset was significantly more frequent in patients who died than in those who recovered. There was a correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity and the cycle threshold value of RdRP by real-time RT-PCR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks at a high COI in patients with COVID-19.

COVID-19 prevalence and predictors in United States adults during peak stay-at-home orders.,"Morlock, Robert; Morlock, Amy; Downen, Martha; Shah, Sonali N","BACKGROUND: Early recognition of COVID-19 cases is essential for effective public health measures aimed at isolation of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample., METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative.

"Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China",Xu R.; Huang J.; Duan C.; Liao Q.; Shan Z.; Wang M.; Rong X.; Li C.; Fu Y.; Wang H. ,"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,/,Journal of Medical Virology,93,3,1743-1747,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26445,2006835762,#78279,Xu 2021,"",""
High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control,"Toth, Damon J.A.; Beams, Alexander; Keegan, Lindsay; Zhang, Yue; Greene, Tom; Orleans, Brian; Seegert, Nathan; Looney, Adam; Alder, Stephen; Samore, Matthew","<h4>Background: </h4> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy. Methods. We compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior PCR test reporting from members of more than 9000 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population. Results. We estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.38% (95% CI 0.30% - 0.48%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 35% (26% - 47%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 15% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.40 (0.32 - 0.51) to avoid continued growth of the Utah epidemic. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.",2021,,,,,,PPR276377,10.1101/2021.01.29.20248797,,#77378,Toth 2021,"",""

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of health care workers,Rivas M.N.; Ebinger J.E.; Wu M.; Sun N.; Braun J.; Sobhani K.; van Eyk J.E.; Cheng S.; Arditi M. ,"BACKGROUND. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The antituberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrates nonspecific, protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a longitudinal, retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, which included information on BCG vaccination status and preexisting demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multisite Los Angeles health care organization. We used multivariate analysis to determine whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS. Of the 6201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination, whereas 68.9% had not received BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as the incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were markedly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared with those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that a history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal, or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS. A history of BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease in the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a lower number of participants who self-reported experiencing COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized, prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm whether BCG vaccination can confer a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2021, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",2021,/,Journal of Clinical Investigation,131,2,e145157,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI145157,2010814494,#76890,Rivas 2021,"",""

Following infection, ICHD patients frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICHD patients. <h4>Methods</h4> Three hundred and fifty-six ICHD patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies. Patients who became seronegative at 6 months were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. <h4>Results</h4> One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at Time 0, of which 127 (98.4%) also had detectable anti-RBD. At 6 months, of 111 patients tested, 71(64.0%) and 97 (87.4%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive respectively, p<0.001. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels reduced significantly after 6 months. Ten patients who were anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive at Time 0, had no detectable antibody at 6 months; of which 8 were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at 6 months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following 6 months. <h4>Conclusions</h4> ICHD patients mount durable immune responses 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with <3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity. These immune responses are associated with a reduced risk of subsequent reinfection. <h4>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h4> Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. Patients with ESKD receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. What is not known is how durable the serological responses in ESKD patients are or whether evidence of prior immune responses protect patients from reinfection. In this study of 356 ICHD patients, at 6 months following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, fewer than 3% of patients lacked evidence of either humoral or cellular immunity. Furthermore, patients with serological evidence of infection had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with subsequent infection or ‘reinfection’, suggesting functional immune protection.",2021,,,,,,PPR273752,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249865,,#77283,Clarke 2021,"",""

Therefore, antibody tests represent an alternative to detect exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze possible risk factors in them. This study aimed to describe and compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and the quality of food intake between individuals with a positive or negative test to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Methods: </h4> Mexican individuals of diverse ages and sex, that attended to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity from July to November 2020 were included. A survey was applied to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and food intake quality in negative and positive individuals for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These variables were compared using the Chi-square test, Kruskal Wallis, Fisher's exact test, or t-student. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this study, a total of 1,799 individuals participated; 42% were positive for SARS-CoV-2. It was found that seropositive subjects were older and that diabetes was more prevalent in them (p <0.01). No differences were identified in the blood type nor vaccination against influenza between seronegative and seropositive cases. Cough, respiratory distress, muscle pain, joint pain, and anosmia were more prevalent in seropositive cases than in those seronegative (p<0.0001). The IgM or IgM+IgG seropositive cases presented anosmia more frequently than those with only IgG antibodies (p<0.05). The dietary patterns and individual food intake habits were similar in both groups, except for the most consumed type of fat (p = 0.006). Seronegative cases showed to consume monounsaturated fats more frequently than other types of fats, whereas seropositive subjects have more regular consumption of polyunsaturated fats. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> This study confirms the association between being anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive with older age and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it suggests muscle and joint pain could also be considered major criteria for discriminating patients with suspected COVID-19 seropositivity. Moreover, the results suggested polyunsaturated fats as a possible new risk factor associated with COVID-19, and anosmia as a marker of active disease.

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population-based IFR., METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood 6 April to 3 May were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas, and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. Seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., RESULTS: The first 20 640 blood donors were tested, and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, .8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers, a combined IFR in patients <70 years is estimated at 89 per 100 000 (95% CI, 72-211) infections., CONCLUSIONS: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely severalfold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.

The correlation between donor demographics and antibody titers is not presently known. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference in neutralizing antibody titers based on donor demographics to include: age, race, and gender. Method(s): Blood donors were screened utilizing a commercial qualitative assay and subsequently reflexed to a quantitative laboratory developed test (LDT) utilizing a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD protein. The LDT is a total immunoglobulin kinetic-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA). The k-ELISA utilized a standard curve created from a pool of 100 CCP donors to calculate a titer by testing a single dilution of each specimen. Testing was performed on donations collected from 30 March 2020 to 29 September 2020. The results were grouped by age, race, and gender for evaluation. The one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett comparison was used to evaluate differences of the mean of each group compared to the mean of all donors. Result(s): There were 16,153 donations tested. The mean titer of all donations was 1208.

Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million). We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n = 2979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests. Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5-12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.22-1.78) and household income < $50,000 (vs. > $100,000: PR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79). Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~ 12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics.

SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors of Catalonia (Spain): Before and after the first wave,Piron M.; Sauleda S.; Bes M.; Martinez A.; Ciruela P.; Basile L.; Puig L.; Jane M. ,"Background: In March 16 2020, total confinement of the Spanish population was implemented in order to mitigate expansion of SARS-CoV-2. By May 15, cumulative incidence (CI) of confirmed cases in Spain were higher than 500 per 100,000. In Catalonia, CI was 756 per 100,000, with uneven distribution among the four provinces: 321 in Tarragona, 451 Lleida, 660 in Girona, and 1042 in Barcelona, two-fold the mean Spanish CI. However, these figures probably underestimated the real exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among general population. Blood donors (BD) have been in the past a valuable sentinel population to assess prevalence and change in trends of emerging infectious diseases in asymptomatic individuals. Archive samples from blood donations provide at present the opportunity to monitor evolution of and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthy individuals. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to assess exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Catalan blood donors before and after the first wave Methods: Seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in two periods: February 29 to March 9 2020 (N = 6,930), and May 16 to June 17 2020 (N = 6,829). Blood donations samples were analyzed for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies (Wantai ELISA test: all samples in the first period, 2,964 samples in the second period) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Euroimmun ELISA test: 3,855 samples of the second period). Samples positive for total antibodies in the first period were also tested for the presence of IgM (Wantai ELISA test). Demographic data (age, gender, postal code of residence) were recorded before anonymization and testing. This study was approved by the Vall d'Hebron Hospital IRB. Result(s): BD included in the two periods were comparable in age (44+/-13 years), gender (50.6% males) and represented the four provinces in Catalonia proportionally to the number of inhabitants: Barcelona 66.8% samples in March and 56.6 in May- June; Girona 12.6% and 17.3%; Lleida 11.3% and 14.5%; Tarragona 9.2% and 11.6%, in each period respectively. The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in March was 0.25% (17/6,930; S/co value 4.1+/-4.0), equally distributed among provinces (0.22% Barcelona, 0.34% Girona, 0.31% Lleida, 0.26% Tarragona). Five of the 17 samples were also IgM positive (3 in Barcelona, 1 in Girona, 1 in Lleida), thus showing true exposure to SARS-CoV-2. False positive reactivity cannot be ruled out in the 12 IgM negative samples. Conversely, in the second period of the study (May-June), the overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (379/6,829; CI95% 5.0% > 6.1%), with similar results obtained with Wantai total antibodies (5.77%, CI95% 4.9% > 6.6%; S/Co 11.6+/-5.4) and Euroimmun IgG (5.41%, CI95% 4.7% > 6.15; S/ Co 4.2+/-2.4). No differences were found in age or gender between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative BD (42+/-13 vs 43+/-13 years; 50% vs 51% males, respectively). As per the four provinces, the SARS-CoV-2 exposure was distributed unequally: 7.69% Barcelona, 3.47% Girona, 2.65% Lleida, 2.02% Tarragona. The exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Barcelona was significantly higher than in the rest of the provinces (P < 0.001). Summary/Conclusions: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among BD after the first wave was 5.6%, showing that the number of asymptomatic cases or not diagnosed inflections was at least 7-fold higher than the reported confirmed CI. Exposure found in the four Catalan provinces was proportional to the respective CI. Conversely, low seroprevalence found just before the first wave indicate that explosive expansion of the virus in Catalonia started end February 2020.

To measure the exact infection rate, we initiated a study that aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 antibodies (SARS-CoV-2) in IBD., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred sixty-four subjects were enrolled in the study, including 432 IBD patients (290 with Crohn's disease and 142 with ulcerative colitis) and 432 non-IBD control group individuals (health professionals) matched for age and gender. Serum samples were prospectively collected, and the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies were measured by using the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) method (Vircell Microbiologists R)., RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of positive results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, both in the IgG and IgM+IgA class, was found in IBD patients (4.6% and 6% respectively, compared to 1.6% and 1.1%; p<0.05).

"Dynamics of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers at a COVID-19 referral hospital in Milan, Italy.","Milazzo, Laura; Lai, Alessia; Pezzati, Laura; Oreni, Letizia; Bergna, Annalisa; Conti, Federico; Meroni, Cristina; Minisci, Davide; Galli, Massimo; Corbellino, Mario; Antinori, Spinello; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa","OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this single-centre prospective study was to evaluate the trend of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCWs working at the primary referral centre for infectious diseases and bioemergencies (eg, COVID-19) in Northern Italy and investigate the factors associated with seroconversion., METHODS: Six hundred and seventy-nine HCW volunteers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies three times between 4 March and 27 May 2020 and completed a questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and personal protective equipment (PPE) training and confidence at each time., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 3/679 to 26/608 (adjusted prevalence: 0.5%, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.7% and 5.4%, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.9, respectively) between the first two time points and then stabilised, in line with the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic in Milan. From the first time point, 61.6% of the HCWs had received training in the use of PPE and 17 (61.5%) of those who proved to be seropositive reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Contacts with ill relatives or friends and self-reported symptoms were independently associated with an increased likelihood of seroconversion (p<0.0001 for both), whereas there was no significant association with professional exposure., CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the HCWs at our COVID-19 referral hospital was low at the time of the peak of the epidemic. The seroconversions were mainly attributable to extrahospital contacts, probably because the hospital readily adopted effective infection control measures. The relatively high number of asymptomatic seropositive HCWs highlights the need to promptly identify and isolate potentially infectious HCWs. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Validation of COVID-19 serologic tests and large scale screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers,Mullins K.E.; Merrill V.; Ward M.; King B.; Rock P.; Caswell M.; Ahlman M.; Harris A.D.; Christenson R. ,"Objectives: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and Methods: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. Result(s): Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. Conclusion(s): Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence.

Influenza Vaccination Coverage and (SARS-CoV-2) Seroprevalance in a Fire Department,Caban-Martinez A.J.; Santiago K.M.; Louzado-Feliciano P.; Gonzalez M.; Brotons A.; Schaefer Solle N.; Issenberg S.B.; Kobetz-Kerman E.N. ,"Purpose: The confluence of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 disease during Fall 2020 will give rise to considerable morbidity and mortality, likely stressing the U.S. healthcare system. Firefighter/paramedic first responders are at risk of being exposed to pathogens such as coronavirus and the avian flu, that can be transmitted between the patients they serve. We estimate influenza vaccination rates by coronavirus infection status in one large metropolitan Florida career fire department. Method(s): We used a cross-sectional study design to estimate flu vaccination prevalence among all frontline firefighter/paramedic workers from a fire department participating in a seroprevalence study. Participants initially provided consent and completed a 76-item web-based survey. Seasonal influenza vaccination was assessed in the 12-months prior to coronavirus testing. Off- and on-duty firefighters/paramedics were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined lateral flow immunoassay during April/May 2020. Result(s): Among the 1,555 participating firefighters/paramedics, 8.5% reported receipt of the seasonal flu vaccine, and 4.1% tested SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. None of the antibody-positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to those who tested negative (0.0% vs. 8.5%; p=0.012). After controlling for potential confounders, firefighters/paramedics who were Hispanic/Latino vs non-Hispanic/Latino (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval=0.20-0.55]), former smokers vs never smokers (AOR:0.47 [0.24-0.93]), and had one or more chronic conditions vs no chronic diseases(AOR:0.33 [0.15-0.75]) were significantly less likely to report seasonal influenza vaccine receipt.

Using high-throughput methods, we assessed herein the serological response against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of 1847 participants working in three sites of an institution in Paris conurbation. In May-July 2020, 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, and 9.5% (95% CI: 8.2-11.0) were neutralizer in pseudo-typed virus assays. The prevalence of seroconversion was 11.6% (95% CI: 10.2-13.2) when considering positivity in at least one assay. In 5% of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative, suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may have reached 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling, anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and neutralization activity in pseudo-virus assay declined by 31%, 17%, and 53%, resulting thus in half-life of 35, 87, and 28 days, respectively.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 prevalence in 1170 asymptomatic Norwegian conscripts.,"Borud, Einar Kristian; Nakstad, Espen Rostrup; Haberg, Siri Eldevik; Lind, Andreas; Fadum, Elin Anita; Taxt, Arne Michael; Steens, Anneke; Gjein, Gaute Eriksen; Sunde, Magne Wiken; Iversen, Petter; Svanevik, Marius; Ahmad, Babar Mushtaq; Waldow, Thomas; Norheim, Arne Johan","Background: Accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different population groups are important for the health authorities. In Norway, public infection control measures have successfully curbed the pandemic. However, military training and service are incompatible with these measures; therefore extended infection control measures were implemented in the Norwegian Armed Forces. We aimed to describe these measures, discuss their value, and investigate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prevalence and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in antibody titer levels over the 6-week military training period in a young, asymptomatic population of conscripts., Methods: In April 2020, 1170 healthy conscripts (median age 20 years) enrolled in military training. Extended infection control measures included a pre-enrollment telephone interview, self-imposed quarantine, questionnaires, and serial SARS-CoV-2 testing. At enrollment, questionnaires were used to collect information on symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody testing was conducted. Serial SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology testing were used to estimate the prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and monitor titer levels at enrollment, and 3 and 6 weeks thereafter., Results: At enrollment, only 0.2% of conscripts were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, and seroprevalence was 0.6%. Serological titer levels increased nearly 5-fold over the 6-week observation period. Eighteen conscripts reported mild respiratory symptoms during the 2 weeks prior to enrollment (all were PCR-negative; one was serology-positive), whereas 17 conscripts reported respiratory symptoms and nine had fever at enrollment (all were PCR- and serology-negative)., Conclusions: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was less than 1% in our sample of healthy Norwegian conscripts.

"Seroepidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in 41 municipalities in Honduras wth no reports of active cases, COVID-19, June 16-23, 2020","Nunez, M. R. M.; Lara, J. A.; Pleitez, S. A.; Ramirez, G. A.","Introduction: In Honduras on March 12, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 was reported. From that moment on, a series of measures were adopted to slow down contact throughout the country. By June 2020, cases are reported across the whole country. With the objective of identifying the presence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2, characterizing and identifying suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 in the population, the present study was carried out. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out, using a quantitative and qualitative approach, using the LQAS sampling method. The study population was the inhabitants of the identified municipalities, with no current circulation data for SARS-CoV-2 or the municipalities whose last confirmed case was 21 days ago. The data was collected through an electronic survey, it was possible to apply rapid antibody detection tests (IgG and IgM). Results: 792 people from 41 municipalities of the country were surveyed and tested. Positivity of contact was found in 6.2% (49/792). Of these, 55.1% (27/49) are men. 61.2% (30/49) are between 20 and 49 years old.The clinical symptoms found were fever, decreased appetite, respiratory distress, and loss of taste and smell, the 49.2% (32/49) without symptoms. Conclusions: virus circulation was demonstrated in the population of municipalities in which no cases were officially reported and after 96 days of the first confirmed case in the country.

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by Reverse transcription-PCR and serology in the Paris area: A cross-sectional study,Cohen R.; Jung C.; Ouldali N.; Sellam A.; Batard C.; Cahn-Sellem F.; Elbez A.; Wollner A.; Romain O.; Corrard F.; Aberrane S.; Soismier N.; Creidy R.; Smati-Lafarge M.; Launay O.; Bechet S.; Varon E.; Levy C. ,"Background Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are potentially less contagious than adults. To examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we combined both Reverse transcription-PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France, Paris, during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods From 14 April 2020 to 12 May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, prospective, multicentre study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory paediatricians. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse transcription-PCR and a microsample of blood for micromethod serology. Results Among the 605 children, 322 (53.2%) were asymptomatic and 283 (46.8%) were symptomatic. Reverse transcription-PCR and serology results were positive for 11 (1.8%) and 65 (10.7%) children, respectively, with no significant difference between asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic children. Only three children were Reverse transcription-PCR-positive without any antibody response detected. The frequency of Reverse transcription-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly higher for children with positive than negative serology results (12.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). Contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 increased the odds of Reverse transcription-PCR positivity (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 40.7) and serology positivity (OR 15.1, 95% CI 6.6 to 34.6). Conclusion In an area heavily affected by COVID-19, after the peak of the first epidemic wave and during the lockdown, the rate of children with Reverse transcription-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity was very low (1.8%), but that of serology positivity was higher (10.7%). Most children with positive Reverse transcription-PCR results also had positive serology results.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck Emergency and Non-Emergency Healthcare Workers.,"Laursen, Jannie; Petersen, Janne; Didriksen, Maria; Iversen, Kasper; Ullum, Henrik","BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse, especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers. It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence., METHODS: This research involved a bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from 22 June 2020 until 10 August 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied., RESULTS: Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group., CONCLUSION: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.",2021,/,International journal of environmental research and public health,18,3,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030923,33494409,#75592,Laursen 2021,"",""

Lessons from low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in schoolchildren: a cross-sectional study.,"Szepfalusi, Zsolt; Schmidthaler, Klara; Sieber, Justyna; Kopanja, Sonja; Gotzinger, Florian; Schoof, Anja; Hoz, Jakub; Willinger, Birgit; Makristathis, Athanasios; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Stiasny, Karin; Bohle, Barbara; Krotka, Pavla; Graf, Alexandra; Frischer, Thomas","BACKGROUND: Children are discussed as hidden SARS-CoV-2 virus reservoir because of predominantly mild or even asymptomatic course of disease. The objective of this cross-sectional study in May-July 2020 was to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and virus RNA in schoolchildren, consistent with previous infection by contact tracing., METHODS: School authorities approached parents for voluntary participation. Interested families were contacted by the study team. A nasal and oropharyngeal swab, a blood sample, and a questionnaire were employed. Primary endpoint was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR- and antibody-positive children. Antibody-positivity was assessed by a highly-sensitive first-line ELISA, and a neutralization assay and two other immunoassays as confirmatory assays., RESULTS: Of 2069 children (median age 13 years, IQR 10-15) 2 cases (0.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 26 cases (1.3%) tested positive for specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies exhibited detectable virus-neutralizing activity in 92% (24 of 26 samples). Seropositivity was associated with a history of mild clinical symptoms in 14 children (53.8%), while 12 children (46.2%) remained asymptomatic. Among 13 seropositive children being tested concomitantly with their siblings, only one pair of siblings was seropositive. Contact tracing revealed adult family members and school teachers as potential index cases., CONCLUSION: In school children, the infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 is low and associated with a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. Virus spreading seemed to occur more likely in intergenerational contacts than among siblings in the same household. The presence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children may reflect protective adaptive immunity. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity among Dental Staff and the Role of Aspirating Systems.,"Sarapultseva, M; Hu, D; Sarapultsev, A","INTRODUCTION: Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of infection owing to occupational exposure to patients and virus-contaminated surfaces., OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed to reveal and compare the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patient-facing HCWs across 3 dental clinics equipped with different types of aspirating systems., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 157 HCWs (43.58 +/- 1.66 y) from 3 dental clinics in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation) who reported to work during the coronavirus disease pandemic. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. The V6000 aspirating system with a vacuum controller (dry or semidry mode) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was used at clinics A and B, and the aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the atmosphere. The VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters was used at clinic C. The aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the operatories. All dental clinics followed the same recommendations for dental patient management and types of personal protective equipment used., RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (19 HCWs) over a 5-mo follow-up (May to August 2020). The prevalence of infection was unaffected by sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (+) was significantly higher at clinic C (equipped with an aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters) than at other clinics., CONCLUSION: The type of aspirating system used and the presence of HEPA filters could affect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across dental clinics. Therefore, we recommend the use of aspirating systems installed with HEPA filters, which evacuate and dissipate aerosols into specialized areas., KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This report confirms that dentists, being patient-facing HCWs, are at a high risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies gaps in the protection of patients and staff in dental settings.",2021,/,JDR clinical and translational research,,101684997,2380084421993099,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2380084421993099,33543682,#77851,Sarapultseva 2021,"",""
Serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers of a tertiary care teaching institution in Central Kerala during the post lockdown phase,"Rafi, Aboobacker Mohamed; Joseph Tomy, Maglin Monica Lisa; Thomas, Ronnie; Valsan, Chithra; Unnikrishnan, UG; Innah, Susheela; Kuttichira, Praveenlal","<h4>Background: </h4> Kerala was the first state to have the confirmed case of COVID 19 in the country and it was first confirmed in Thrissur district on 30 January 2020.Our institute being in the heart of the city had to take adequate measures to mitigate the spread and treat the required patients by keeping its staff safe & healthy. The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital. Aim: To estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown Methodology: A cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020 Results: Jubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 423 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID 19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23 to 11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.

This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. Method(s): A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. Result(s): Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4 +/- 0.9, mean +/- SD), highly symptomatic (7.5 +/- 1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0 +/- 1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3 +/- 8.3 versus 17.3 +/- 9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. Conclusion(s): Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms.

Seroconversion incidence (positive IgM and/or IgG) was 100/2282(4.4%,95%:CI:3.6-5.3),mostly asymptomatic(64/100,64.0%), with a daily hazard = 0.21%(95%-CI:0.17-0.25)/48746 person-days of follow-up. Seroconversion was 4.0%(64/1596;95%CI:3.1-5.1) among asymptomatic and 5.3%(36/686;95%CI:3.7-7.2) among symptomatic HCWs. Seroconversion was independently associated with older age(HR:2.71,95%CI:1.31-5.58); lower education(HR:3.89,95%CI:1.89-8.00); contact with a confirmed case>15 minutes(HR:2.20,95%CI:1.18-4.10); chronic kidney disease(HR:4.42,95%CI:1.03-18.96); pregnancy(HR:3.5,95%CI:1.05-11.85); change/loss of smell(HR:3.17,95%CI:1.48-6.78); and negatively associated with contact at workplace(HR:0.48,95%CI:0.28-0.82)., CONCLUSIONS: Most seroconversions were asymptomatic, emphasizing the need for regular universal testing. Seropositivity was three-fold that observed at baseline. Cumulative infections increased nationally by a similar rate, suggesting that HCWs' infections reflect community not nosocomial transmission during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

Insight into the practical performance of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 using serological data: a cohort study.,"Zhang, Zhen; Bi, Qifang; Fang, Shisong; Wei, Lan; Wang, Xin; He, Jianfan; Wu, Yongsheng; Liu, Xiaojian; Gao, Wei; Zhang, Renli; Gong, Wenfeng; Su, Qiru; Azman, Andrew S; Lessler, Justin; Zou, Xuan","Background: Virological detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through RT-PCR has limitations for surveillance. Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China., Methods: We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative., Findings: Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (53.0%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (50.1%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (74.9%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (4.5%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 4.1% (95% CI 2.9-5.7), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (0.0% [95% CI 0.0-1.1]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 8.0 times (95% CI 5.3-12.7) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection., Interpretation: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China., Funding: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Special Foundation of Science and Technology Innovation Strategy of Guangdong Province, and Key Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission.

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have not been well described. We describe the prevalence of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital in South India. <h4>Methods:</h4> To determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS. <h4>Results:</h4> Of 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month - 17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p=0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIM-TS (54.8 AU/mL). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary children's hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS.

Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic medical record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable.

Large-scale IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 serological screening among healthcare workers with a low infection prevalence based on nasopharyngeal swab tests in an Italian university hospital: perspectives for public health.,"Vimercati, Luigi; Stefanizzi, Pasquale; De Maria, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Cavone, Domenica; Quarato, Marco; Gesualdo, Loreto; Lopalco, Pier Luigi; Migliore, Giovanni; Sponselli, Stefania; Graziano, Giusi; Vittoria Larocca, Angela Maria; Tafuri, Silvio","BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2infection given their specific tasks. The IgG-IgM serological assay has demonstrated good accuracy in early detection in symptomatic patients, but its role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is uncertain. The aim of our study was to assess IgM and IgG prevalence in sera in a large cohort of HCWs previously subjected to Nasopharyngeal swab test (NST) after accurate risk assessment due to positive COVID-19 patient exposure during an observation period of 90 days., METHODS: 2407 asymptomatic HCWs that had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the period between April 8th and June 7th were screened with NST based on the RT-PCR method. In parallel, they underwent large-scale chemiluminescence immunoassays involving IgM-IgG serological screening to determine actual viral spread in the same cohort., RESULTS: During the 90-day observation period, 18 workers (0.75%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the NST, whereas the positivity rates for IgM and IgG were 11.51% and 2.37%, respectively (277 workers). Despite high specificity, serological tests were inadequate for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with previous positive NST results (IgM and IgG sensitivities of 27.78% and 50.00%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a widespread low viral load of SARS-CoV-2 among hospital workers. However, serological screening showed very low sensitivity with respect to NST in identifying infected workers, and negative IgG and IgM results should not exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. IgG-IgM chemiluminescence immunoassays could increase the diagnosis of COVID-19 only in association with NST, and this association is considered helpful for decision-making regarding returning to work.

Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"Herrington, David; =The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership Study Group","<h4>Background: </h4> Estimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies.

Do COVID-19 Antibodies Provide Long-Term Protection?,"Ansari, S. F.; Memon, M.; Kumar, R.; Memon, S.; Memon, M. K.","Introduction: Post severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, an immune response is generated among healthy, immunocompetent individuals with immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) antibodies. IgM rises earlier than IgG, indicating a recent infection. However, a detailed analysis is required to assess long-term immune reactions induced by antibodies. Method and Materials: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from June 2020 to October 2020 where serum samples were collected from patients. The samples were obtained by phlebotomy for antibody testing. All the reactive patients were followed up after 60 days of initial testing. Results: A total of 728 patients participated in the study, of which 79 (10.8%) were seropositive at baseline. Seventy-two (91.1%) participants came back for follow-up after 60 days (two months) and were included in the final analysis. Among the 72 participants, 35 (48.6%) exhibited symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and 37 (51.4%) were asymptomatic. After 60 days, 37 (including 20 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic) participants were still seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Mean change in percentage from seropositive to seronegative was more in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic patients (54.0% vs. 42.8%). Conclusion: In this study, humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is not long-lasting among individuals with mild signs and symptoms.

Hospital-Wide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in health care workers in a Spanish teaching hospital.,"Galan, M Isabel; Velasco, Maria; Casas, M Luisa; Goyanes, M Jose; Rodriguez-Caravaca, Gil; Losa-Garcia, Juan E; Noguera, Carmen; Castilla, Virgilio; Working Group Alcorcon COVID-19 investigators","INTRODUCTION: Hospital-wide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is rarely explored and can identify areas of unexpected risk. We determined the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all health care workers (HCW) at a hospital., METHODS: Cross-sectional study (14-27/04/2020). We determined SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in all HCW including external workers of a teaching hospital in Madrid. They were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure., RESULTS: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (88,7%) were evaluated. The mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1), and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Of these, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high- (33.1%) and medium- (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but not for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p>0.05). HWC with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR-positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis seropositivity was significantly associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), nurse assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27)., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed among HCW.

Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads., Exposures: SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data., Results: The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants.

Efforts to stem the pandemic (including vaccination, now being introduced) can benefit from direct understanding of the relationship of age-specific mortality to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and from information on asymptomatic infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: The Action to Beat Coronavirus (Ab-C) study surveyed a reasonably representative sample of 19,994 adult Canadians about COVID symptoms and analyzed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from self-collected dried blood spots (DBS) in 8,967 adults. A sensitive and specific chemiluminescence ELISA detected IgG to the spike trimer. We compared seroprevalence to deaths to establish infection fatality rates (IFRs) and used mortality data to estimate infection levels in nursing home residents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The best estimate (high specificity) of adult seroprevalence nationally is 1.7%, but as high as 3.5% (high sensitivity) depending on assay cutoffs. The highest prevalence was in Ontario (2.4-3.9%), the most populous province, and in younger adults aged 18-39 years (2.5-4.4%). Based on mortality, we estimated 13-16% of nursing home residents became infected. The first viral wave infected 0.54-1.08 million adult Canadians, half of whom were &amp;lt;40 years old. The IFR outside nursing homes was 0.20-0.40%, but the COVID death rate in nursing home residents was &amp;gt;70 times higher than comparably-aged adults living in the community. Seropositivity correlated with COVID symptoms, particularly during March. Asymptomatic adults constituted about a quarter of definite seropositives, with a greater proportion in the elderly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Canada had relatively low infection prevalence and low IFRs in the community, but not in nursing homes, during the first viral wave. The Ab-C study demonstrates the practicability of using self-collected DBS for antibody testing in national surveys to monitor the pandemic and vaccine-induced immunity in the population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: Pfizer Global Medical, Unity Health Foundation, Canadian COVID-19 Immunity Task Force&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: Ethics approval was provided by St. Michael's Institutional Review&lt;br&gt;Board.

Prevalence and socio-demographic factors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in multi-ethnic healthcare workers.,"Patel, Mehool; Nair, Meera; Pirozzoli, Eric; Cienfuegos, Marta C; Aitken, Elizabeth","INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers are particularly susceptible to developing COVID-19 owing to close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody., METHODS: Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had immunoglobulin G SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff were cross-referenced with these tests., RESULTS: Of 7,013 staff, 6,212 (89%) undertook the antibody test during this period. Overall detection rate was 26% (1,584/6,212). Univariate analyses revealed no differences in prevalence in terms of gender or age. Compared with white staff members (18%), rates were higher in black (38%) and Asian (27%) members (p<0.001). The rates in general wards (43%) were higher compared with other areas; in emergency medicine and intensive care, prevalence was 23% (p<0.001). Regarding professional groups, prevalence was highest among nursing and allied clinical services (28%), less in doctors (23%) and lower in non-clinical staff (19%)., DISCUSSION: This large study has described prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and determined associations including ethnicity, professional groups and geographical areas within healthcare settings. This information will be useful in future COVID-19 studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations and in healthcare settings. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2021.

A serological mass screening campaign targeting the Ariano Irpino population using the Roche Cobas Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay was organized by the Zoo-Prophylactic Institute of Southern Italy (Portici, Italy) and conducted in cooperation with the Local Health Unit (Azienda Sanitaria Locale - ASL - Avellino, Avellino, Italy), the Department of Public Health of University Federico II (Naples, Italy) and Department of Health Services of Azienda Ospedaliera dei Colli-Cotugno and Monaldi Hospital (Naples, Italy) in May 2020. A total of 13,218 asymptomatic individuals were reviewed in this analysis. A total of 738 citizens tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (398 females, 340 males). The overall prevalence in the sample was 5.6% (95% CI: 5.2-6.0). Among seropositive citizens, 101 cases tested positive on RT-PCR (0.76% of the overall population). Among citizens aged 14-18, 18-65 and >65 years, the seroprevalence was equal to 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1-8.7), 5.6 (95% CI: 5.1-6.1) and 4% (95% CI: 3.3-4.8), respectively. In the pediatric cohort (<14 years old), seroprevalence was 13% (95% CI: 10.2-16.2).

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among health care workers in a New York City hospital: A cross-sectional analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Venugopal, U.; Jilani, N.; Rabah, S.; Shariff, M. A.; Jawed, M.; Batres, A. M.; Abubacker, M.; Menon, S.; Pillai, A.; Shabarek, N.; Kasubhai, M.; Dimitrov, V.; Menon, V.","Background: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in US adults who have not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflect the US population (n = 11,382) and who had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 were selected by quota sampling from 241,424 volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04334954 ). Enrolled participants provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and 9,028 blood samples. The majority (88.7%) of samples were collected between May 10th and July 31st, 2020. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies. Estimation of seroprevalence was performed by using a weighted analysis to reflect the US population. We detected an undiagnosed seropositivity rate of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.6 - 6.5%). There was distinct regional variability, with heightened seropositivity in locations of early outbreaks. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest estimated undiagnosed seropositivity within groups was detected in younger participants (ages 18-45, 5.9%), females (5.5%), Black/African American (14.2%), Hispanic (6.1%), and Urban residents (5.3%), and lower undiagnosed seropositivity in those with chronic diseases. During the first wave of infection over the spring/summer of 2020 an estimate of 4.6% of adults had a prior undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that there were 4.8 (95% CI: 2.8-6.8) undiagnosed cases for every diagnosed case of COVID-19 during this same time period in the United States, and an estimated 16.8 million undiagnosed cases by mid-July 2020.",2021,,,,,,PPR276235,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250570,,#77363,Kalish 2021,"",""
The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia.,"Mahallawi, Waleed H; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen H","Background: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2., Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia., Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%-21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O)., Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.

The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population. <h4>Objectives</h4> The aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening. <h4>Study Design</h4> Open uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study. <h4>Setting/Participants</h4> A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study. <h4>Study Interventions and Measures</h4> Rapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4±7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0±12.8 days after their initial test. <h4>Results</h4> In our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%). The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5%).

Gastroenterology services include emergency and critical care along with the endoscopy procedures, which have aerosol-generating potential. This study was aimed at auditing the COVID-19 impact on HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department of our hospital., Methods: The COVID-19 status of 117 HCWs was collected using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroassay. COVID-19 positivity was correlated with demographic characteristics, job profile, area of work, and medical history., Results: Thirty-eight HCWs (32.48%) showed evidence of COVID-19 using PCR (23.93%) or only IgG assay (8.55%). Endoscopy technicians (68.75%) exhibited significantly higher (P = 0.003) COVID-19 incidence compared to doctors (20.69%). Those working in the critical care units exhibited a trend toward higher COVID-19 incidence (42.86%). None of the six HCWs who received adequate hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis developed evidence of COVID-19. All the HCWs with COVID-19 disease recovered. However, there was a considerable loss of ""man-days."", Conclusions: In our setting, we observed a high COVID-19 risk for HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department, with the highest risk among the endoscopy technicians. A more stringent triaging and pretesting of patients, as well as HCWs, might decrease the risk of COVID-19. Further multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the risk and related parameters.

Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"Gaskell, Katherine; Johnson, Marina; Gould, Victoria; Hunt, Adam; Stone, Neil RH; Waites, William; Kasstan, Ben; Chantler, Tracey; Lal, Sham; Roberts, Chrissy; Goldblatt, David; Eggo, Rosalind; Marks, Michael","<h4>Background</h4> Ethnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. <h4>Findings</h4> A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0335; MR/V027956/1], a donation from the LSHTM Alumni COVID-19 response fund, HDR UK, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. The funders had no role in the design, conduct or analysis of the study or the decision to publish. The authors have no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work. <h4>Research In Context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> In January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, seroprevalence, “ethnic minority”, and “Jewish” with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups. <h4>Added value of the study</h4> We report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults. <h4>Implications of the available evidence</h4> Our data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",2021,,,,,,PPR277515,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250839,,#78589,Gaskell 2021,"",""

Methods Healthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs. Results 633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). 7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%. 110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50 1/300 dilution; no cohabitee achieved this level. Conclusions Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.",2021,,,,,,PPR277543,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250950,,#78595,Craxford 2021,"",""

Seroprevalence of Specific Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from Hotspot Communities in the Dominican Republic.,"Paulino-Ramirez, Robert; Baez, Amado Alejandro; Vallejo Degaudenzi, Alejandro; Tapia, Leandro","Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance to assess the proportion of a population that has developed antibodies against a newly introduced virus and could therefore potentially exhibit immunologic protection against subsequent infection. This study aims to understand the distribution of IgM and IgG antibodies in the Dominican Republic. We surveyed a total of 12,897 participants between April and June 2020 in 10 provinces of the Dominican Republic. Survey efforts in emerging hotspots yielded a positivity for all participants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM of 3.8% and IgG of 5.4%, indicating that the pathogen was in circulation before the identification of those particular communities as hotspots. We found important age differences between participants who participated in the serological study where a higher mean age is associated IgM positivity and a lower age with IgG positivity. Our results highlight the need for strategies that involve community-based seroprevalence monitoring. These should preclude syndromic case identification. Also, the higher mean age of IgM-positive participants suggests that strategies based on syndromic surveillance could identify hotspots at later phases, based on the number of cases detected at the healthcare center, as such community-based seroprevalence monitoring may be an effective intervention for future outbreaks.",2020,/,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,,"3zq, 0370507",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0907,33094710,#49777,Paulino-Ramirez 2020,"",""

Antibody positivity was defined as a dual-positive response against both the receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were measured by immuno-precipitation assays in capillary blood from 15,771 children aged 1 to 18 years living in Bavaria, Germany, and participating in a public health type 1 diabetes screening program (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04039945), in 1,916 dried blood spots from neonates in a Bavarian screening study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03316261), and in 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Virus positive incidence was obtained from Bavarian health authority data., Findings: Dual-antibody positivity was detected in none of 3887 children in 2019 (100% specificity) and 73 of 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (97.3% sensitivity). Antibody surveillance in children during 2020 resulted in frequencies of 0.08% in January to March, 0.61% in April, 0.74% in May, 1.13% in June and 0.91% in July. Antibody prevalence from April 2020 was six-fold higher than the incidence of authority-reported cases (156 per 100,000 children), showed marked variation between the seven Bavarian regions (P<0.0001), and was not associated with age or sex. Transmission in children with virus-positive family members was 35%; 47% of positive children were asymptomatic. No association with type 1 diabetes autoimmunity was observed. Antibody frequency in newborns was 0.47%., Conclusion: We demonstrate the value of population-based screening programs for pandemic monitoring., Funding: The work was supported by funding from the BMBF (FKZ01KX1818).

The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95%CI) was calculated., RESULTS: Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95%CI: 5,8-7,3). There were statistically significant differences depending on the occupation, from 8,7% (95%CI: 6,9-10,6) on medics down to 3,2% (95%CI: 1,0-8,0) on personnel not associated with health care. The other characteristics did not associate significantly to antibody presence against SARS-CoV-2., CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency in HCP is similar to the estimated in the general population for big cities in Spain. This highlights the effectiveness of the infection control and prevention programme in this healthcare department targeted at healthcare personnel.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of current and past SARS-CoV-2 infections among police employees. Method(s): This cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 5082 police employees from Mazowieckie Province, Poland. RT-PCR testing for current SARS-CoV-2 infection and serological tests (ELISA) for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA and IgG antibodies were performed. Result(s): All RT-PCR tests were negative. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA index was positive (>8) in 8.9% of participants, including 11.2% women and 7.7% men (p < 0.001). Equivocal IgM+IgA index (6-8) was found in 9.8% of participants, including 11.9% women and 8.7% men (p < 0.001). The IgG index was positive (>6) in 4.3% and equivocal (4-6) in 13.2% of participants. A higher odds of positive IgM+IgA index was found in women vs. men (OR: 1.742) and police officers vs. civilian employees (OR: 1.411). Participants aged >=60 years had a higher odds of positive IgG index vs. those aged 20-29 years (OR: 3.309). Daily vaping also increased the odds of positive IgG index (OR: 2.058). Conclusion(s): The majority of Polish police employees are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaping and older age (>=60 years) were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

The prevalence rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG is 1.2% - Screening in asymptomatic outpatients in Germany (Northrhine-Westfalia),Herrmann B.L. ,"Patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). To date, few data have been obtained of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-antibodies in general population and in asymptomatic outpatients in Germany. From March 26 to June 4 2020, 415 asymptomatic outpatients were tested prospectively in Northrhine-Westfalia (Germany), to detect SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies. In case of a positive result, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA was determined additionally. 5 of 415 asymptomatic outpatients had positive SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies with a calculated prevalence of 1.2%. Reference range of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA and IgG was defined as ratio for negative < 0.8, borderline 0.8-1.1 and > 1.1 positive. The mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies of the positive 5 outpatients was lower than in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (n = 12) and positive PCR of SARS-CoV-2 (3.04 +/- 2.58 versus 8.05 +/- 6.70; p = 0.002). 4 of 5 patients had elevated SARS-CoV-2-IgA-antibodies (1.61 +/- 0.82). In 408 screening-outpatients with negative anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgG (< 0.8), the mean ratio was 0.25 +/- 0.13. Two patients were in the borderline range (0.83 and 0.86). The prevalence of 1.2% of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies and consequently the rate of infection in asymptomatic outpatients in Northrhine-Westfalia (Germany) is low. The impact of virus neutralisation by antibodies and consequently immunization is the challenge of further investigations.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2020,/,MMW-Fortschritte der Medizin,162,14,44-46,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15006-020-0750-y,2005828774,#60198,Herrmann 2020,"",""

Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center,Freeman M.C.; Rapsinski G.J.; Zilla M.L.; Wheeler S.E. ,"BACKGROUND: The burden of COVID-19 is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULT(S): We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (CI 95%: 0.3-2.4%). Two patients were positive by NP swab RT-PCR, but only one seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or solid organ transplant were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared to other groups. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and two patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

We quantified seroprevalence stratified by ethnicity, occupation and seniority of practitioner and used logistic regression to examine demographic and occupational factors associated with seropositivity., RESULTS: A total of 1148/10662 (10.8%) hospital staff members were seropositive. Compared to White staff (seroprevalence 9.1%), seroprevalence was higher in South Asian (12.3%) and Black (21.2%) staff. The occupations and department with the highest seroprevalence were nurses/healthcare assistants (13.7%) and the Emergency Department (ED)/Acute Medicine (17.5%), respectively. Seroprevalence decreased with seniority in medical/nursing practitioners. Minority ethnicity was associated with seropositivity on an adjusted analysis (South Asian: aOR 1.26; 95%CI: 1.07-1.49 and Black: 2.42; 1.90-3.09). Anaesthetics/ICU staff members were less likely to be seropositive than ED/Acute medicine staff (0.41; 0.27-0.61)., CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity and occupational factors, including specialty and seniority, are associated with seropositivity for anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG. These findings could be used to inform occupational risk assessments for front-line healthcare workers. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection., DESIGN: This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16 April to 3 July 2020 at 5 UK sites, recruited children of healthcare workers, aged 2-15 years. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms., RESULTS: 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10.1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34/68 (50%) reported no symptoms prior to testing. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariable analysis four independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity: known infected household contact OR=10.9 (95% CI 6.1 to 19.6); fatigue OR=16.8 (95% CI 5.5 to 51.9); gastrointestinal symptoms OR=6.6 (95% CI 3.0 to 13.8); and changes in sense of smell or taste OR=10.0 (95% CI 2.4 to 11.4)., DISCUSSION: Children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age. Fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste were the symptoms most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-1 antibody positivity., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (trial registration: NCT0434740) on the 15 April 2020.

The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients.Copyright: © 2020 Mattern et al.

To this end we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among retired blood donors and combined it with national COVID-19 survey data to provide reliable population-based IFR estimates for this age group., METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing. Overall, 1,201 (37.5%) individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Wantai) and compared to 1,110 active blood donors age 17-69 years. Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively. Using available population data on COVID-19 related fatalities, IFRs for patients age 70 years or older and for 17-69 years were estimated at 5.4% (95% CI: 2.7%-6.4%) and 0.083% (95% CI: 0.054%-0.18%), respectively. Only 52.4% of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive retired blood donors reported having been sick since the start of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IFR in the age group above 69 years is estimated to be 65 times as high as the IFR for people age 18-69 years.

To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt., METHODS: Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests., RESULTS: Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n = 54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever >=38degreeC and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n = 116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0)., CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

To identify IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals of the National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology during the quarantine from April to June 2020. Materials and methods. The study included 1589 healthcare workers: 1293 professionals of 'green zone' and 926 medical staff of 'red zone'. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum were determined using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-ELISA kits (National Hematology Research Center, Russia). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the kit PROBA-NK (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). The virus was identified by RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV Multiplex REAL-TIME PCR Detection Kit (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). Results. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 141 healthcare workers (8.9%), controversial results were revealed in 2 professionals, and 1445 (90.9%) workers had no antibodies, including 46 (3.2%) people who had the clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral disease (ARVI) and identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among healthcare workers with antibodies, the clinical symptoms of ARVI were revealed in 129 (91.5%) workers, they were also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 23 (17.8%) people had clinical symptoms of ARVI but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not extracted; 12 (8,5%) workers had neither clinical symptoms of ARVI nor detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusion. The presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker had this disease; the presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker has this disease.Copyright © A group of authors, 2020.",2020,/,Akusherstvo i Ginekologiya (Russian Federation),2020,7,122-128,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18565/aig.2020.7.122-128,2005285379,#55216,Krechetova 2020,"",""
Assessment of Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 in a Cohort of Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Nailescu, Corina; Khalid, Myda; Wilson, Amy C; Amanat, Fatima; Arregui, Samuel; Canas, Jorge; Hooks, Jenaya; Krammer, Florian; Schwaderer, Andrew L; Hains, David S","Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective: To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.

To estimate the prevalence of past infection in a population, the most readily available method is the detection of antibodies against the virus. This study has investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of the Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo city (Brazil), which is a large university hospital belonging to the public health system that cares for patients with complex diseases who need tertiary or quaternary medical care. Our serological inquiry was carried out for 6 weeks, with once-a-week blood sampling and included 439 patients from several outpatient services. Overall, 61 patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (13.9%); 56.1 % of the patients live in Sao Paulo city, with the remaining living in other towns of the metropolitan area; 32.8% of the patients testing positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, 55.7% developed mild or moderate disease and 11.5% had to be hospitalized. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was lower among patients who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to the ones who did not. These findings may indicate that those individuals care more about health issues, and/or that they have a better access to health care and/or a better quality of health care service.

The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country., OBJECTIVE: This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests., RESULTS: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lome was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government.

Antibody kinetics, including IgG subclasses, was assessed till month 3., RESULTS: At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection (501). IgM, IgG and IgA levels declined in 3 months (antibody decay rates 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11; 0.19), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54; 0.82), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09; 0.16), respectively), and 68.33% of HCW had seroreverted for IgM, 3.08% for IgG, and 24.29% for IgA. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 (highest levels) and IgG2, followed by IgG3, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected., CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW remains critical, particularly in high-risk groups.

METHOD(S): We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, aged >=18 years and residing in non-congregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020 and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. RESULT(S): Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [+/-17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic White individuals) included at the state-level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state-level reported following risk mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. CONCLUSION(S): These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and there is variation by race/ethnicity.

COVID-19 and lombardy: TESTing the impact of the first wave of the pandemic: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in northern Italy,Perico L.; Tomasoni S.; Peracchi T.; Perna A.; Pezzotta A.; Remuzzi G.; Benigni A. ,"Background: Italy was the first western country to experience a large Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and the province of Bergamo experienced one of the deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks in the world. Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Finding(s): ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. Interpretation(s): the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies.

RT-PCR is the gold standard, but can be false-negative. Method(s): 119 residents and 93 staff members were tested with RT-PCR test and/or a rapid IgM/IgG test. Of these participants, 176 had both tests, 24 only RT-PCR, and 12 only IgM/IgG in the period April 14 to 16 April 2020. Result(s): 40 (34%) residents and 11 (13%) staff were PCR-positive. Using a rapid IgM/IgG test, 17 (17%) residents and 18 (20%) staff were positive for IgM and/or IgG (IgM/IgG).

Of the 134 PCR-negative participants who had an IgM/IgG test, 15 were positive for IgM/IgG (8% of the 200 participants tested with RT-PCR). Conclusion(s): During an acute outbreak in a nursing home, 26% of residents and staff were PCR-positive. An additional 8% was diagnosed using IgM/IgG antibody testing.

From May to July seroprevalence stayed stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population.

A Prospective Sero-epidemiological Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in a German Secondary Care Hospital,Herzberg J.; Vollmer T.; Fischer B.; Becher H.; Becker A.-K.; Sahly H.; Honarpisheh H.; Guraya S.Y.; Strate T.; Knabbe C. ,"OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 causing the pulmonary disease COVID-19 has challenged healthcare facilities worldwide. The sustainability of healthcare systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study was aimed at the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCW in a German hospital, as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. METHOD(S): Between March and June 2020, we performed this study using a combination of RT-PCR test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ELISA to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCW in a German hospital by repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and blood samples. RESULT(S): A total of 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPS and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. In three participants (0.34%) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. CONCLUSION(S): Our study reports low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. It might, however, indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees. Our study protocol may serve as a thought-provoking example for future pandemic containment protocols in hospitals.Copyright © 2020.

Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8% ) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms, 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.Copyright © 2020.

Neutralizing Antibodies Correlate with Protection from SARS-CoV-2 in Humans during a Fishery Vessel Outbreak with a High Attack Rate,"Addetia, Amin; Crawford, Katharine H.

However, to date, studies on protective immunity have been performed only in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range, 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR-positive viral test with a cycle threshold (C-T) of <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested that the outbreak originated largely from a single viral Glade. Only three crew members tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of the crew members with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against reinfection (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.002).",2020,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY,58,11,,,10.1128/JCM.02107-20,,#51134,Addetia 2020,"",""

All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood., RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms., CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.

Data regarding COVID-19 incidence in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are sparse. From 19 March to 19 May 2020, we performed a systematic screening for COVID-19 in KTR. Tests included serum analysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using S protein-based immunofluorescence, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and/or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from nasal-throat swabs. Outpatient serum samples from KTR with PCR confirmed COVID-19, and swab samples from recipients (+donors) undergoing kidney transplantation were analyzed. Out of 223 samples from outpatients, 13 patients were positive with solely anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA and 3 with both anti-IgA and anti-IgG. In total, 53 patients were symptomatic in the past, but positive results could be found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. After an in depth analysis using immunofluorescence and neutralization tests in 2 KTR, recent COVID-19 infection remained highly suspicious. Apart from outpatient visits, only 5 out of 2044 KTR were symptomatic and tested positive via PCR, of which 4 recovered and one died.

The prevalence of such antibodies among healthcare workers, presumed at higher risk for infection, has been increasingly investigated, more studies are needed to better understand the risks and infection transmission in different healthcare settings. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001), and loss of smell (p < .001), but not for occupations (p = .710). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage, and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity, as recently described, may possibly play a greater role in healthcare workers than in the general population.",2020,/,PloS one,15,11,e0240006,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240006,33180782,#52329,Brant-Zawadzki 2020,"",""

Participants completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors before blood sampling. Samples were analyzed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) for the qualitative detection of IgG class antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum or plasma. RESULT(S): The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 4.0% (3.0%, 5.1%). Factors associated with having a positive test included history of anosmia and/or loss of taste (95% CI: 1.4-9.6). A history of respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, was not associated with a positive antibody test.

However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy., METHODS: 354 sera from IBD patients under biological therapy recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were i) age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii) healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii) IBD patients under biological therapy collected in the pre-COVID era., RESULTS: 8 out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody (prevalence 2.3%). IgG positive patients' percentage recruited from Milan was significantly higher than those recruited from other locations (prevalence 5.4% vs. 0.4% p < 0.005).

Seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in the setting of a non-dedicated COVID-19 hospital in a low CoV-2 incidence area: Implications for surgery.,"Medas, Fabio; Cappellacci, Federico; Anedda, Giacomo; Canu, Gian Luigi; Del Giacco, Stefano; Calo, Pietro Giorgio; Firinu, Davide","The aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in the setting of a non-dedicated COVID-19 hospital in a low CoV-2 incidence area. We analysed the data of the patients admitted at our surgical department during the period 31st March - June 30, 2020. Among 86 patients included in the study, we found 2 (2.3%) patients positive for both SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG, 2 (2.3%) for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and 1 for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. Thus, seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8%; nasopharyngeal swab was negative in all the cases. Considering the current limitations in sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab, the uncertainty in the natural history of SARS-CoV2, and the reported prevalence of CoV-2, we think that careful preadmission triage and tests, the use of personal protective equipment and safe management of surgical smoke are mandatory also in our context of low CoV-2 incidence area.

"Prevalence of Coronavirus Antibody Among First Responders in Lubbock, Texas.","Iwuji, Kenneth; Islam, Ebtesam; Berdine, Gilbert; Nugent, Kenneth; Test, Victor; Tijerina, Amanda","BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a major impact on first responders. Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced them to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to first responders is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure in these front-line workers., AIM: Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 among first responders in Lubbock, Texas., METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 683 asymptomatic first responders who work in Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the Abbott's ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer., RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.73%, five of the 683 participants tested positive. Four of those who tested positive had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure without adequate PPE., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. The most likely explanations for this finding include limited exposure, inadequate time for a IgG response, possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract IgA defense system without eliciting a systemic IgG response, and short persistence of IgG antibodies in mild or asymptomatic cases.",2020,/,Journal of primary care & community health,11,101518419,2150132720971390,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150132720971390,33161808,#52587,Iwuji 2020,"",""

Prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,Zambelli A.; Fotia V.; Bosetti T.; Negrini G.; di Croce A.; Moro C.; Poletti P.L.; Bettini A.C.; Arnoldi E.; Messina C.; Merelli B.; Callegaro A.P.; Chiudinelli L.; Mosconi S.; Tondini C. ,"Background: The European SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicentre in Italy, particularly in the area of Bergamo. In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Method(s): From April 1st, 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of COVID-19, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference b/w mildly symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (38 vs. 17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6 vs. 10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.

Does Working in a COVID-19 Receiving Health Facility Influence Seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2?.,"Noor, Mohammad; Haq, Mohsina; Ul Haq, Najib; Amin, Said; Rahim, Fawad; Bahadur, Sher; Ullah, Raza; Khan, Muhammad Asif; Mahmood, Afsheen; Gul, Huma","Objective In this study, we aimed at comparing the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in healthcare workers (HCWs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving and non-COVID-19 receiving hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in a COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'A') and a non-COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'B'). Using stratified random sampling, 1,011 HCWs (439 from hospital 'A' and 572 from hospital 'B') were recruited to participate in the study. Immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) antibodies were checked using Elecsys R (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. The chi-squared test was used to compare frequencies, and the binary logistic regression model was used to predict the association between study variables' seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the two hospitals was 30.76%. It was 28.2% in hospital 'A' and 32.7% in hospital 'B' (p=0.129). The seroprevalence in HCWs having direct contact with COVID-19 patients was higher (33.1%) in non-COVID-19 receiving hospital versus 23.8% in COVID-19 receiving hospital (p=0.034). Seroprevalence was highest among administrative staff (44.0%), followed by nurses (30.8%), residents (19.8%), and consultants (17.8%) (p=0.001). As compared to consultants, the administrative and nursing staff were 3.398 and 3.116 times more likely to have positive antibodies, respectively. There were no significant differences in the seroprevalence between the respective categories of staff of the two hospitals. Conclusions The non-COVID-19 receiving hospital had a higher proportion of seropositive HCWs than the COVID-19 receiving hospital. The HCWs in the non-COVID-19 receiving hospital who had direct contact with patients had significantly higher seroprevalence. Seroprevalence was highest for administrative staff followed by nursing staff, residents, and consultants. Regardless of the COVID-19 status of the healthcare facility, all HCWs shall be trained on, and consistently follow, the proper protocols for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE).

RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR SARS-COV-2 SEROPOSITIVITY WITHIN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE,Prados N.; Gonzalez-Ravina C.; Vergara V.; Herrero J.; Cruz M.; Requena A. ,"Objective: Making decisions about how to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without completely disrupting our activity requires better tools that inform the extent of transmission. Understanding risk factors of virus susceptibility could help us to establish intervention policies. The objective of our work is to assess risk factors and seroprevalence in our patients in order to plan evidence-based strategies. Design(s): Multicenter retrospective, anonymized cohort analysis performed in 11 private clinics belonging to the IVIRMA group in Spain. Material(s) and Method(s): Between April 27th and June 26th, 2020, 6140 individuals undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Before tested, a symptomatic triage had been carried out and only patients classified with a negative triage attended the clinic for further testing. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We divided our clinics into two different geographic areas: region A (seroprevalence <5%) and region B (seroprevalence >5%) based on the results obtained in our population. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Result(s): Of the 6140 persons tested for SARS-CoV-2, 4470 (72.8%) were women and 1670 (27.2%) men. Over the course of the study, 42 (0.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Seropositivity does not vary significantly with age and we did not observe differences regarding gender or blood group. However, we found that individuals with negative rhesus (Rh) factor had a slightly greater risk of being seropositive (RR 2.5 [129-2.13]) than those Rh positive. There are no differences in the percentage of people in the active phase of the disease depending on the geographical area (RR 0.8 [0.43-1.52]). However, when we analysed the data according to time, the rate of positive individuals does not vary throughout the weeks in region A, while for the region B the incidence of IgM drops significantly (p=0.003) from the first week of the study (3.7%) to the last (0.0%), which would indicate decline of the virus transmission over time. When we analysed the seropositivity rate according the partner's serological status, the data showed that there is approximately 10 times more incidence of being positive IgG in couples than in random population. Conclusion(s): We show that in areas with higher prevalence of the disease, the percentage of IgM positive individuals is also higher. Also, there is a greater risk of being infected when the couple is already seropositive. No differences were observed according the age and there is higher prevalence in Rh-negative individuals.Copyright © 2020",2020,/,Fertility and Sterility,114,3 Supplement,e542,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.077,2008034210,#44621,Prados 2020,"",""

This study was aimed at determining asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a suburban, Southern U.S. population during a period of state restrictions and physical distancing mandates. This is one of the first published seroprevalence studies from North Carolina and included multicenter, primary care, and emergency care facilities serving a low-density, suburban and rural population since description of the North Carolina state index case introducing the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen to this population. To estimate point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals over time, two cohort studies were examined. The first cohort study, named ScreenNC, was comprised of outpatient clinics, and the second cohort study, named ScreenNC2, was comprised of inpatients unrelated to COVID-19. Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 (with no clinical symptoms) was examined using an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved antibody test (Abbott) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This assay as performed under CLIA had a reported specificity/sensitivity of 100%/99.6%. ScreenNC identified 24 out of 2,973 (0.8%) positive individuals among asymptomatic participants accessing health care during 28 April to 19 June 2020, which was increasing over time. A separate cohort, ScreenNC2, sampled from 3 March to 4 June 2020, identified 10 out of 1,449 (0.7%) positive participants. IMPORTANCE This study suggests limited but accelerating asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic infections, like symptomatic infections, disproportionately affected vulnerable communities in this population, and seroprevalence was higher in African American participants than in White participants. The low, overall prevalence may reflect the success of shelter-in-place mandates at the time this study was performed and of maintaining effective physical distancing practices among suburban populations.

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic., MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11,766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. 63 healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset., RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody with discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N specific antibodies, S1 specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17d to 25d, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months., CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health and immunization strategies.

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: a cross-sectional study,Anand S.; Montez-Rath M.; Han J.; Bozeman J.; Kerschmann R.; Beyer P.; Parsonnet J.; Chertow G.M. ,"BACKGROUND: Many patients receiving dialysis in the USA share the socioeconomic characteristics of underserved communities, and undergo routine monthly laboratory testing, facilitating a practical, unbiased, and repeatable assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. METHOD(S): For this cross-sectional study, in partnership with a central laboratory that receives samples from approximately 1300 dialysis facilities across the USA, we tested the remainder plasma of 28 503 randomly selected adult patients receiving dialysis in July, 2020, using a spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody chemiluminescence assay (100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity). We extracted data on age, sex, race and ethnicity, and residence and facility ZIP codes from the anonymised electronic health records, linking patient-level residence data with cumulative and daily cases and deaths per 100 000 population and with nasal swab test positivity rates. We standardised prevalence estimates according to the overall US dialysis and adult population, and present estimates for four prespecified strata (age, sex, region, and race and ethnicity). FINDINGS: The sampled population had similar age, sex, and race and ethnicity distribution to the US dialysis population, with a higher proportion of older people, men, and people living in majority Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods than in the US adult population. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8.0% (95% CI 7.7-8.4) in the sample, 8.3% (8.0-8.6) when standardised to the US dialysis population, and 9.3% (8.8-9.9) when standardised to the US adult population. When standardised to the US dialysis population, seroprevalence ranged from 3.5% (3.1-3.9) in the west to 27.2% (25.9-28.5) in the northeast. Comparing seroprevalent and case counts per 100 000 population, we found that 9.2% (8.7-9.8) of seropositive patients were diagnosed. When compared with other measures of SARS-CoV-2 spread, seroprevalence correlated best with deaths per 100 000 population (Spearman's rho=0.77). Residents of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods experienced higher odds of seropositivity (odds ratio 3.9 [95% CI 3.4-4.6] and 2.3 [1.9-2.6], respectively) compared with residents of predominantly non-Hispanic white neighbourhoods. Residents of neighbourhoods in the highest population density quintile experienced increased odds of seropositivity (10.3 [8.7-12.2]) compared with residents of the lowest density quintile. County mobility restrictions that reduced workplace visits by at least 5% in early March, 2020, were associated with lower odds of seropositivity in July, 2020 (0.4 [0.3-0.5]) when compared with a reduction of less than 5%. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 10% of the US adult population formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and fewer than 10% of those with antibodies were diagnosed. Public health efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread need to especially target racial and ethnic minority and densely populated communities.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in Brazil: results from two successive nationwide serological household surveys,Hallal P.C.; Hartwig F.P.; Horta B.L.; Silveira M.F.; Struchiner C.J.; Vidaletti L.P.; Neumann N.A.; Pellanda L.C.; Dellagostin O.A.; Burattini M.N.; Victora G.D.; Menezes A.M.B.; Barros F.C.; Barros A.J.D.; Victora C.G. ,"Background: Population-based data on COVID-19 are essential for guiding policies. There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases. Method(s): In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures. Finding(s): We included 25 025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31 165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.7-2.1) to 3.1% (2.8-3.4). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.4% in both surveys. 11 (69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 2.0% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 2.0%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (7.5% [4.2-12.2]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (4.4% [3.5-5.6] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 6.4% (4.1-9.4) compared with 1.4% (1.2-1.7) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 3.7% (3.2-4.3) compared with 1.7% (1.4-2.2) in the wealthiest quintile. Interpretation(s): Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status. These population subgroups are unlikely to be protected if the policy response to the pandemic by the national government continues to downplay scientific evidence.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Among Pediatric Healthcare Workers in Spain,Dacosta-Urbieta A.; Rivero-Calle I.; Pardo-Seco J.; Redondo-Collazo L.; Salas A.; Gomez-Rial J.; Martinon-Torres F. ,"Spain is one of the countries most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with almost 190,000 cases as of April 18, 2020. As healthcare workers (HCW) are one of the groups hardest hit by the infection, it is important to know the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric departments. We performed 175 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG immunochromatographic rapid tests in the personnel working at the Pediatric Department of the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), including pediatricians, residents, nurses, and other staff, on days 31-33 since the lockdown started. Seven out of the 175 tests were positive, including four for IgM and three for IgG, leading to a seroprevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 1.1-6.9%). Only one of them had symptoms at the time of testing (sore throat). All seropositive cases yielded negative RT-PCR of the upper and lower respiratory tract. This is the first SARS-CoV-2 serological survey among HCWs reported in Spain. Notwithstanding the test limitations, our results reveal that personal protection policy and lockdown measures have been effective to limit population exposure. The low seroprevalence rate poses a significant challenge for the next strategic steps of pandemic control.© Copyright © 2020 Dacosta-Urbieta, Rivero-Calle, Pardo-Seco, Redondo-Collazo, Salas, Gomez-Rial and Martinon-Torres.",2020,/,Frontiers in Pediatrics,8,"(Dacosta-Urbieta, Rivero-Calle, Pardo-Seco, Redondo-Collazo, Salas, Gomez-Rial, Martinon-Torres) Grupo de Investigacion en Genetica, Vacunas, Infecciones y Pediatria (GENVIP), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Santiago (IDIS) and Hospital Clinico Un",547,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00547,632931962,#39579,Dacosta-Urbieta 2020,"",""

We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. Methods: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. Results: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. Conclusions: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.",2020,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY,130,,,,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104575,,#41377,Malfertheiner 2020,"",""
Universal screening of SARS-CoV-2 of oncology healthcare workers - a Brazilian experience,Ismael Amaral Silva P.A.; Ismael C.; Marchon da Silva C.; Domenge C. ,"Background: The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has placed unprecedented strain on health-care services worldwide. Centro de Terapia Oncologica (CTO) is a Oncology clinic in Petropolis, countryside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This discussion aims to appoint the necessity of mass testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs), in order to avoid workforce unnecessary quarantine, reduce spread in asymptomatic or mild cases and protect the health of HCWs and patients. Method(s): Between 09 and 29 April of 2020, 60 CTO HCWs were tested for COVID-19. They were all tested through IgM/IgG rapid testing by near-patient lateral flow devices, while nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were added as a secondary investigational method amongst symptomatic HCWs. In total, 62 tests were done: 61 IgM/IgG tests were done and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR testing. Result(s): A total of 4 HCW tested positive among 62 tests. They were all immediately quarantined for 14 days and represent 6,6% of the service's total workforce. Out of the 4 positive cases, 2 were female, with 60 years or more, and the remaining 2 were men aged between 30 and 42 years; 3 of these HCW were asymptomatic and only 1 had symptoms of the disease. Results illustrated in the table. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): Wide availability of testing for antibodies and the universal testing of HCW would be a game changer as it: reduces in-hospital transmission; reduces a potential source of asymptomatic ongoing transmission during a period of social distancing; promotes the wellbeing of HCW ensuring that infected colleagues are promptly tested and isolated; enables the service to isolate those who require it, avoiding being short-staffed due to self-isolation or widespread contamination of the HCW. Unfortunately, mass testing is still not a palpable reality for most healthcare services in Brazil, especially in the public health sector, mainly due to financial reasons.

Symptoms associated with seroprevalence were anosmia (odds ratio (OR) 28.4, 95% CI 20.6-39.5) and ageusia (OR 19.2, 95% CI 14.3-26.1). Seroprevalence was also associated with patient contact (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.5) and covid-19 patient contact (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.2-5.3). These findings imply an occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare workers safety and reduce transmission from healthcare workers to patients and to the community.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,/,Nature Communications,11,1,5064,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18848-0,2006914341,#38562,Rudberg 2020,"",""

"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 17,971 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region.","Jespersen, Sanne; Mikkelsen, Susan; Greve, Thomas; Kaspersen, Kathrine Agergard; Tolstrup, Martin; Boldsen, Jens Kjaergaard; Redder, Jacob Dvinge; Nielsen, Kent; Abildgaard, Anders Monsted; Kolstad, Henrik Albert; Ostergaard, Lars; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Moller, Holger Jon; Erikstrup, Christian","BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to perform a seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups., METHODS: All healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited to be tested by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China)., RESULTS: A total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%), while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result., CONCLUSIONS: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic women admitted for delivery must be performed with a combination of microbiological techniques: an observational study,Vinuela M.C.; De Leon-Luis J.A.; Alonso R.; Catalan P.; Lizarraga S.; Munoz P.; Bouza E. ,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the value of systematic screening in asymptomatic women admitted for spontaneous delivery with a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cycle threshold (Ct) and serum antibodies. METHOD(S): Since May 6 all women admitted for spontaneous delivery underwent RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and specific antibodies IgG of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum that were performed as part of routine clinical care in our institution. Ct of the PCR was recorded. We analyzed the first 100 women consecutively admitted for spontaneous delivery at our institution. RESULT(S): Nine women were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (9%) and 13 (13%) presented positive specific antibodies of the coronavirus. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 prior exposure was 15%. The Ct determination (RT-PCR test) of our 9 positive patients ranged from 36 to 41 cycles with a median of 40. Vaginal delivery occurred in 94% of the cases and only 6% underwent a cesarean section, always for obstetric reasons. No fetal transmission was observed and maternal and neonatal prognosis was excellent. CONCLUSION(S): During epidemic episodes in asymptomatic women in labor, universal testing with RT-PCR (considering Ct determination), and the detection of antibodies, permits a better interpretation of the results and avoid unnecessary isolation procedures.Copyright ©The Author 2020.

The etiological diagnosis presupposes the isolation of virus genetic material in the patient's biological sample but laboratory diagnostics also make use of searching possibility for IgG, IgM classes antibodies. The characteristics of the antibody response are not yet completely clear. This study describes a serological monitoring of subjects, elderly nursing care residence guests, interested by a very large infection outbreak. After first nasopharyngeal swab, all the positive subjects (43) were monitored for the persistence of the virus infection through nasopharyngeal swab after 20 days (16-24), 32 days (28-36) and after 49 days (47-50). At the same time, during the second (day 32) and third (day 49) follow up, all the guests were investigated for IgM and IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, by using a quantitative chemiluminescence method. Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative. The comparison of the levels of IgG-Ab between the controls shows a significant decrease in concentrations (-10%). Our study confirms that in most patients affected by COVID-19 there is a typical antibody response with IgG-Ab present in 90% of nursing care COVID-19 positive residence guests.

METHOD(S): We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>=4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. RESULT(S): We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of census tract residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income &$50,000/year.

Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline health care workers in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak.,"Tong, Xin; Ning, Mingzhe; Huang, Rui; Jia, Bei; Yan, Xiaomin; Xiong, Yali; Wu, Weihua; Liu, Jiacheng; Chen, Yuxin; Wu, Chao","INTRODUCTION: As an emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout worldwide. Health care workers (HCWs) on frontline directly participated in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of COVID-19 patients are at high risk of getting infected with the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, a total of 222 medical staff went to Wuhan city for support. In this study, we aimed to determine any nosocomial infection among our cohort of HCWs who worked in Wuhan., METHODS: Throat swab samples were obtained for RNA testing on day 1 and 14 of their quarantine upon their return to Nanjing. Radiological assessments were performed by chest computed tomography (CT) on day 14 of their quarantine. The blood was collected from 191 HCWs between May 12 and May 15. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody responses were determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay., RESULTS: All the throat swab specimens were found negative for SARS-CoV-2. The radiological analysis revealed that there was no typical chest CT scan of COVID-19 among 222 HCWs. Consistently, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG was also found to be negative among 191 HCWs., CONCLUSIONS: There was no nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 among our cohort of the frontline HCWs, suggesting that zero occupational infection is an achievable goal with appropriate training, strict compliance, and psychological support for the frontline HCWs.

Highlighted prospects of an IgM/IgG antibodies test in identifying individuals with asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infection.,"Li, Yaqing; He, Qiang; Yu, Rizhen; Jiang, Hui; Wang, Weizhong; Feng, Dujin; Hou, Guanghua; Zhou, Hongbin; Jiang, Yaona; Xiang, Zhun","Context, Covert severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections could be seeding new outbreaks. How to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections early has become a global focus. Objective , To explore the roles of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detection, nucleic acid tests and computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, The clinical data of 389 individuals with close contacts including in general characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 etiology, serum-specific IgM and IgG antibody detection and CT imaging results, were systematically analyzed. Results , The present study showed that only 89 of the 389 individuals with close contacts were positive after the first nucleic acid test, while 300 individuals were still negative after two nucleic acid tests. Among the 300 individuals, 75 did not have pneumonia, and the other 225 individuals had pulmonary imaging changes. A total of 143 individuals were eventually diagnosed as having asymptomatic infection through IgM antibody and IgG antibody detection. The sensitivity, specificity and false-negative rate of IgM and IgG antibody detection were approximately 97.1% (347/357), 95.3% (204/214) and 4.67% (10/214), respectively. It also indicated that over approximately 2 weeks, most individuals were both IgM positive and IgG positive, accounting for 68.57% (72/105). Over approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of IgM-positive and IgG-positive individuals decreased to 8.57% (9/105), and the proportion of IgM-negative and IgG-positive individuals increased to 76.19% (80/105).

The Light and Shadow of Rapid Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results from a Study in a Large Emergency Department.,"Loconsole, Daniela; Centrone, Francesca; Morcavallo, Caterina; Campanella, Silvia; Sallustio, Anna; Quarto, Michele; Procacci, Vito; Chironna, Maria","A critical point in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the need to promptly identify the greatest number of infected people and to implement strict public health measures. In this study, the performance of a rapid serological test in a clinical setting was evaluated. Samples from 819 consecutive patients (with or without respiratory symptoms) admitted to a large Emergency Department were tested between 23 March and 21 April 2020. Patient samples were tested in a real-time PCR assay and a serological assay. In total, 148/819 patients (18.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. The serological test revealed that 70/819 patients (8.5%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly higher in patients with respiratory symptoms lasting for >7 days than in those with respiratory symptoms lasting for 0-7 days (p < 0.001). The serological assay had an overall sensitivity of 35.1% and an overall specificity of 97.3%. A high negative predictive value (96.7%) was reported for patients without respiratory symptoms. The results confirm that rapid serological assays alone are not sufficient for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection but can be incorporated into large-scale screening programs during periods in which the virus circulation is low.",2020,/,International journal of environmental research and public health,17,18,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186493,32906596,#38306,Loconsole 2020,"",""
Exposure of hospital healthcare workers to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).,"Razvi, Salman; Oliver, Rahima; Moore, Jonathan; Beeby, Andrew","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of infection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can also amplify outbreaks within healthcare facilities if they become ill. Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

Unexpected diagnosis of COVID-19-associated disorders by SARS-CoV-2-specific serology.,"Pere, Helene; Vedie, Benoit; Vernet, Raphael; Demory, Nathalie; Kassis, Najiby; Mirault, Tristan; Lazareth, Helene; Volle, Geoffroy; Denoix, Elsa; Lebeaux, David; Podglajen, Isabelle; Belec, Laurent; Veyer, David","Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals with on-going infection as well as past coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). We herein evaluated the analytical performances of the CE IVD-labeled Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Des Plaines, IL, USA) carried out with the automated Abbott Architect TM i2000 platform at Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France, using serum sample panels obtained from health-workers with COVID-19 history confirmed by positive nucleic acid amplification-based diagnosis and from patients randomly selected for whom serum samples were collected before the COVID-19 epidemic. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 %, demonstrating high analytical performances allowing convenient management of suspected on-going and past-infections. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rates were compared in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free areas from our hospital. Thus, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was around 10-fold higher in COVID-19 areas than COVID-19 free areas (75 % versus 8%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, several inpatients hospitalized in COVID-19 free areas suffering from a wide range of unexplained clinical features including cardiac, vascular, renal, metabolic and infectious disorders, were unexpectedly found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by systematic routine serology, suggesting possible causal involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, these observations highlight the potential interest of SARS-CoV-2-specific serology in the context of COVID-19 epidemic, especially to assess past SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as possible unexpected COVID-19-associated disorders.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the West Bank region of Palestine: a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study.,"Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal; Salah, Zaidoun; Asia, Mohammad; Abu Khader, Imad; Herzallah, Khaled; Balqis, Nadeen; Sallam, Husam","OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence rates are important indicators to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the extent of the pandemic given the existence of asymptomatic cases. The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank., SETTING: The study involved 1355 participants from 11 governorates, including 112 localities in the West Bank and 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories., PARTICIPANTS: Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank, in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine check-up., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated as the proportion of individuals who had a positive result in the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the immunoassay., RESULTS: The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% and an adjusted CI (0% to 0.0043%), while the lab referral samples yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% and an adjusted CI (0.001325% to 0.011566%)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that as of mid-June 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persists low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasising the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control. Population-based seroprevalence studies are to be conducted periodically to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Palestine and inform policymakers about the efficacy of their surveillance system.

The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay., RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002)., DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak.

Here, we use a sero-survey to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in a symptom-independent manner. Five hundred three adult and 555 pediatric serum/plasma samples were collected from patients presenting to Barnes-Jewish Hospital or St. Louis Children's Hospital between 14 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. We developed protocols for in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using spike and nucleoprotein and used the assays to estimate a seroprevalence rate based on our samples. Overall IgG seropositivity was estimated to be 1.71% (95% credible interval [CI], 0.04% to 3.38%) in pediatric samples and 3.11% (95% CI, 0.92% to 5.32%) in adult samples. Seropositivity was significantly lower in children under 5 years of age than in adults, but rates between adults and children aged 5 or older were similar.

Study Design: This is a retrospective review of all gravidas delivering between March 22 and Sept 12, 2020. A program of universal testing for COVID-19 by SARS-COV2 nasopharyngeal PCR was begun on March 22, 2020 in which all patients underwent PCR testing immediately before or at delivery admission. COVID-19 serology became available on May 17 2020 and was sent at provider discretion until universal serology was sent on all patients admitted for delivery beginning on July 20, 2020 (week 18). Electronic medical records were queried to capture date and results of any pre-delivery PCR test as well as delivery PCR and serology testing. Patients were considered COVID-positive if they had any laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection including any positive PCR or isolated positive serology (PCR-/Ab+). Within each week of the study period, delivery volume was tabulated and frequency of subjects with laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection (ever PCR+ or Ab+, ever PCR+, PCR-/Ab+) were calculated Results: Over the 25 week study period, 2192 patients gave birth of which 341 (15.56%) had laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection at or before delivery (range 4.0-46.1%) (Table 1). 218 (9.95%) gravidas had a positive SARS-COV2 PCR and 123 (5.61%) had no prior positive PCR but positive COVID serology at delivery admission. Introduction of universal serology testing demonstrated laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection similar to rates of PCR-positivity observed at the height of the pandemic (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Although frequency of positive PCR decreased as the pandemic progressed, introduction of universal serology demonstrated that approximately 20% of patients admitted for delivery had laboratory evidence of prior COVID-19 infection.

Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom., SUBJECTS: Staff working in critical care., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection.

Non-Hispanic African-American and Hispanic women had a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate while Asian and non-Hispanic White women had a lower seroprevalence rate, p=0.00. Women in the low socioeconomic group were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 compared to women in the middle/high socioeconomic group, p=0.00. Conclusion(s): Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy may be affected by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Our findings are consistent with those of prior studies and support the presence of racial disparities in risk for infection.

This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20th and 30th, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%. Of the serology positive samples, 100 samples were further tested using the SAS2pp neutralization assay; 92 (92%) samples showed neutralization activity. The seropositivity rate in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is low and varies across different regions with higher positivity in case-hospitals than control-hospitals. The lack of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 8% of the tested samples could mean that assay is a more sensitive assay or that neutralization assay has a lower detection limits; or possibly that some samples had cross-reaction to spike protein of other coronaviruses in the assay, but these were not specific to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

V.; Imanzadeh, F.; Maham, S.; Razmara, R.; Karimi, A.; Eshghi, P.; Maghsudlu, M.; Arabkhazaeli, A.","Background: In December 2019, a new coronavirus appeared in China, as a cause of acute respiratory disease. Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in children's hospitals are one of the groups who are at a high rate of exposure to COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies is useful and helps diagnose late or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most children may present with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be silent sources of infection in the community and hospitals. Objectives: This study was conducted to determine the antibodies (IgM and IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 in Mofid children's hospital staff. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated 475 staff from Mofid children's hospital from April 20 to May 5, 2020, in Tehran. We collected blood samples for the antibody assay with a rapid test kit. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Results: Of 475 staff who participated in this study, 25 (5.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and/or CT scan. Besides,140 (29.4%) of them were positive for IgM and/or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Conclusions: The seropositivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among children's hospital staff was higher than expected. Approximately 5% of the participants were diagnosed as definitive positive COVID-19 cases by PCR and/or CT scan, but 29.4% of them were seropositive.

Without these data, it is almost impossible for the state authorities to manage the epidemic and adopt rational measures. This article brings the results of a medium-sized seroprevalence study which was carried out in the spring of 2020 in South Bohemia. In the Strakonice and Pisek regions, the ELISA method was used to test the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies in 2011 subjects, volunteers from general public and selected professions working in areas with a higher exposure to the infection. The study showed that already in May 2020, 2.9% of inhabitants of the Strakonice region and 1.9% of inhabitants of the Pisek region had antibodies against the coronavirus. These numbers imply that for each PCR positive person, there were at least fifty others who had probably already undergone the infection. The article points out three types of problems that might occur in such a study. First, the study must be planned correctly, and possible outcomes must be pre-assessed. Second, an appropriate test must be selected with known parameters. This enables us to correctly estimate the share of false positive and false negative results.

This study aimed to evaluate the value of COVID-19 antibody rapid test assessment in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel., Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from 20th March until 20th May 2020. The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate. In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended., Results: A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36.14+/-8.70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87.7% were males). Most of the participants (73.3%) had history of exposure. One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47.9%) of them had at least one positive result. Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test; of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG.

However, whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in Norwegian HCW in a prospective cohort study., METHODS: We enrolled 607 HCW pre- and post-the first COVID-19-pandemic wave. Exposure history, COVID-19-like symptoms and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays., RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies increased after the first pandemic wave in HCW with COVID-19-patient exposure, but not in HCW without patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with >=4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up, 8 were positive (7 seroconverted and 1 had undetectable antibodies)., CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19-patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a low prevalence setting, however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.

COVIPREG is a prospective French multicenter study to assess the seroprevalence at the time of delivery and the maternal and neonatal impact of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. In order to study factors associated with poor outcomes after COVID-19 Infection during pregnancy and adapt the sample size of the study, a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was planned after 500 inclusions in a one perinatal center of Paris area., OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in pregnant women at the time of delivery during the COVID-19 pandemia., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study at Cochin hospital (Level III maternity). Patients admitted for delivery were offered to participate to the study. Each patient participating to the study was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA., RESULTS: Among the 529 patients included in the COVIPREG study between April 29 and June 26, 529 were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response and 25 had a positive test, ie 4.7% with a confidence interval at 95% [3.0%-6.9%])., CONCLUSIONS: Four months after the beginning of the infection in Paris, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in pregnant women at the time of delivery is low. Studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy should take this information in account in order to adapt the sample size. Copyright © 2020.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the current COVID-19 pandemic amongst co-workers at a UK renal transplant centre.,"Black, J T; Haroon, U; Barnes, S C; Mayaleh, S; Bagul, A","INTRODUCTION: As lock-downs and social distancing measures around the world begin to ease after the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, discussions surrounding immunity and antibody testing are on the rise. This single-centre observational study reports data from a UK renal transplant centre with regards to seroprevalence amongst staff members. Members of staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) with Abbott International assays. Electronic records were accessed for PCR RNA and antibody results, with data anonymised by hospital number. IgA antibodies were not tested due to test kit availability during this period. 200 members of staff (25% male, 75% female, mean age 45.3 +/- 12.0 years) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 24/200 (12.0%) positive. Most interestingly, 2/30 (6.6%) co-workers had positive nose/throat RNA PCR but negative antibody tests. This study demonstrates that frontline healthcare workers have a relatively low seroprevalence rate of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. To further evaluate this, larger patient populations, multicentre studies and different antibody assays are needed to better understand whether detection of antibodies is suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Serologic Evaluation of Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients in the Republic of Korea.,"Ko, Jae-Hoon; Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hyun Ah; Kang, Seung-Ji; Baek, Jin Yang; Park, Su-Jin; Hyun, Miri; Jo, Ik Joon; Chung, Chi Ryang; Kim, Yae-Jean; Kang, Eun-Suk; Choi, Young Ki; Chang, Hyun-Ha; Jung, Sook In; Peck, Kyong Ran","The safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is an important aspect of managing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the South Korea, highly stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines are implemented, and reports of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs are limited. However, subclinical infections may have been missed by the current symptom-based screening strategy. To evaluate the risk of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, we conducted a multicenter seroprevalence study after the first surge of the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 432 HCWs were evaluated, comprising 309 HCWs designated to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient care and 123 non-designated HCWs. Designated HCWs wore personal protective equipment including an N95 respirator, eye protection, hooded overalls, shoe covers, and inner and outer gloves. Use of a powered air-purifying respirator was recommended for aerosol-generating procedures or long-duration care activities. A high-sensitivity (99.1%) fluorescence immunoassay immunoglobulin G (IgG) kit was used as the initial screening test, and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for total and IgG antibodies were used to confirm the test results. A microneutralization test was additionally performed to evaluate the neutralizing activity of positive specimens. Among the evaluated HCWs, none of the non-designated HCWs had a positive result, while one of the HCWs designated for COVID-19 patient care (1/309, 0.3%) was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 with confirmed neutralizing activity (1:40). This finding suggests that subclinical seroconversion may occur among HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients, although the risk is low under strict IPC guidance.

Here we present the results of prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients from the University Hospital of Torrejon (Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain)., METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies was assessed using a commercially available rapid test (Testsealabs R IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette) and collect the result from cancer outpatients who attended the medical oncology consult at University Hospital of Torrejon between June 1st and June 19th, 2020., FINDINGS: We analyzed the serological test results of 229 cancer patients. We estimated an overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) of 31.4%. The probability of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was similar between men and women, type of treatment and cancer stage. The probability of seropositivity was significantly higher in cancer patients with pneumonia compared with cancer patients without pneumonia (Odds Ratio (OR) 7.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1,85-31,58])., INTERPRETATION: Our results show a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cancer patients than in the general population.

Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULT(S): The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, chi2=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95%CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Community seroprevalence of COVID-19 in probable and possible cases at primary health care centres in Spain,Montenegro P.; Brotons C.; Serrano J.; Fernandez D.; Garcia-Ramos C.; Ichazo B.; Lemaire J.; Moral I.; Wienese R.P.; Pitarch M.; Puig M.; Vilella M.T.; Sellares J. ,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of information about patients with mild or moderate symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is especially true for those who attended and were followed up at primary care settings. OBJECTIVE(S): We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of possible cases and among probable cases followed in primary care. METHOD(S): We selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups from a total population of 19 899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona. We also invited all the patients that had been followed by General Practitioners (GPs). For both populations, we used COVID-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassays, which qualitatively assess the presence of patient-generated Immunoglobulins G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). RESULT(S): Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample participated in the study. The mean age was 43.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 21.79] and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.47% (95% confidence interval = 3.44-8.58). Six hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed up by GPs. The mean age was 46.97 years (SD = 20.05) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among possible cases was lower than expected. Approximately, 40% of the symptomatic patients followed up by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic were positive.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

A total of 3609 individuals were included in this analysis. Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) class antibodies] at three private laboratories (Istituto Diganostico Varelli, Medical Center, and Casa della Salute di Genova). Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0% [398/3609; confidence interval (CI) 10.0%-12.1%]. Seroprevalence was higher in female inmates than in male inmates (12.5% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), with the highest rate observed among adults aged >55 years (13.2%).

SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in health care workers of the Veneto Region,Plebani M.; Padoan A.; Fedeli U.; Schievano E.; Vecchiato E.; Lippi G.; Lo Cascio G.; Porru S.; Palu G. ,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called MaglumiTM 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.

METHOD(S): We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitants industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear coefficients of determination (R2). RESULT(S): Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74 to 4.18), 34% lower in elderly >=60 years-old. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06 to 0.11) to 4.63% (2.93 to 7.84) in individuals 20 to 39 years-old and >=60 years-old, respectively. R2 for exponential age-dependent hospitalization rate and IFR were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent. Household contacts and MPP workers are at higher risk of infection. Our findings are valuable for health-policy making and resource allocation to mitigate the pandemic.Copyright © 2020.

Method(s): A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Result(s): Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for >=15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). Conclusion(s): Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The weighted overall seroprevalence was 0.93% (95% CI: 0.27, 2.09) and varied between males [1.05% (95% CI: 0.18, 2.92)] and females [0.84% (95% CI: 0.13, 2.49)], age-groups and different categories (higher in participants from the School of Health Sciences and in scientific affiliates/faculty members/laboratory assistants), but no statistical differences were detected. Although focused on the specific population of NKUA members, our study shows that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs for the period June-July 2020 remained low and provides knowledge of public health importance for the NKUA members.

In this study, we enrolled 475 cases of COVID-19 and 389 controls. Consecutive throat swabs specimens (n=1875) from 187 patients were collected to analyzed the dynamic changes of RNA. Moreover, 162 serial serum samples from 31 patients were tested for seroconversion of IgM and IgG. Meanwhile, IgM and IgG were also detected in 409 COVID-19 patients and 389 controls. Additionally, the logistic regression analysis was executed to identify the possible influence factors for antibody production. The median positive conversion time for RNA was day 7 (IQR, 3-11), and the positive rate was the highest in the early stage (74.59 % at day 1-5) and then gradually decreased. The median time of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were both day 12 (IQR, 10-15). The sensitivity and specificity for IgM (or IgG) was 87.04 % and 96.92 %, respectively. The positive rates of IgM and IgG were both low at the day 1-5 (18.52% for IgM, 14.81% for IgG), and then significantly increased. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that reduced lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were independent factors for negative results of IgM and IgG tests.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6,p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.",,,INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY,,,,,10.1007/s40121-020-00334-1,,#32421,,"",""
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgA and IgG Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers,"Alharbi, Suliman A.; Almutairi, Abdullah Z.; Jan, Abdulhalem A.; Alkhalify, Amal M.","Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly across the world. A nucleic acid real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal samples is the standard method for the diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, many limitations of the RQ-PCR tests make them unsuitable for the simple and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some individuals with COVID-19 present an asymptomatic infection. Thus, assessing the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs), is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the current preventive measures. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are needed to quickly identify a large number of asymptomatic carriers to prevent the further spread of the virus and assess level of possible serological immunity in a community. Method Between April 18 and June 17, 2020, 330 HCWs from five Madinah region-affiliated hospitals underwent a seroprevalence screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]M/IgA and IgG) using indirect ELISA testing. Result Among the 330 samples, 80 (24.24%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and/or IgG antibodies. There were no significant differences observed in the seroprevalence among the different occupations of the HCWs (excluding the pharmacists) with respect to the percentage of their seropositive samples. Conclusion The current study presented the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG antibodies in HCWs. The regular screening of HCWs for these antibodies is necessary; subsequently, a molecular test is recommended for those with seropositive (IgM, IgA, and IgG) samples to assess their viral load and potential shedding.",2020,,CUREUS,12,9,,,10.7759/cureus.10285,,#32425,Alharbi 2020,"",""

An estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was achieved by screening an unselected cohort of pregnant women. Of interest was the number of unreported cases. Methods Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer's exact test. Results From 6 April to 13 May 2020, 234 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics. A total of 225 (96.2 %) SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were carried out and all remained negative. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6 %) of 180 (76.9 %) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95 % confidence interval between 0-1.7 %. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0-3.8 %, which does not differ from the 0-4.8 % for 76 households without children (p = 1.00). Discussion This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19., METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded. Results were compared with findings in blood donors in the Capital Region in the study period., FINDINGS: Between April 15 and April 23, 2020, we screened 29 295 health-care workers, of whom 28 792 (98.28%) provided their test results. We identified 1163 (4.04% [95% CI 3.82-4.27]) seropositive health-care workers. Seroprevalence was higher in health-care workers than in blood donors (142 [3.04%] of 4672; risk ratio [RR] 1.33 [95% CI 1.12-1.58]; p<0.001). Seroprevalence was higher in male health-care workers (331 [5.45%] of 6077) than in female health-care workers (832 [3.66%] of 22 715; RR 1.49 [1.31-1.68]; p<0.001). Frontline health-care workers working in hospitals had a significantly higher seroprevalence (779 [4.55%] of 16 356) than health-care workers in other settings (384 [3.29%] of 11 657; RR 1.38 [1.22-1.56]; p<0.001). Health-care workers working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (95 [7.19%] of 1321) had a significantly higher seroprevalence than other frontline health-care workers working in hospitals (696 [4.35%] of 15 983; RR 1.65 [1.34-2.03]; p<0.001). 622 [53.5%] of 1163 seropositive participants reported symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2.

High seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among household members of essential workers detected using a dried blood spot assay,"McDade, Thomas W.; McNally, Elizabeth M.; Zelikovich, Aaron S.; D'Aquila, Richard; Mustanski, Brian; Miller, Aaron; Vaught, Lauren A.; Reiser, Nina L.; Bogdanovic, Elena; Fallon, Katherine S.; Demonbreun, Alexis R.","Objective Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. Methods An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. Results Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. Conclusion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,8,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0237833,,#32046,McDade 2020,"",""

Nevertheless, data about risk of infection for health care workers are sparse. METHOD(S): In a large primary care facility, 151 workers underwent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing. In addition, participants had to complete a survey regarding symptoms and their individual risk of infection. RESULT(S): Symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 occurred in 72%, fever in 25% of all subjects. Four workers (2.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.8-7.1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. None of these was free from COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. Source of infection was presumably professional in three of four individuals. CONCLUSION(S): Our systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of health care workers in a large outpatient centre revealed an apparently low rate of 2.6% past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Relative risk for infection following health care profession cannot be derived as data about infection rates in the corresponding general population are lacking.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Methodology: One hundred and fifty-four young policemen (mean age 27.1 +/- 3.8 years) were included in the study after written consent. Squad officers who had any sign of acute respiratory infection were excluded from the study. The participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding nature of exposure with the infected cases, kind of personal protective equipment they are provided with and living arrangements. Three ml of blood samples were collected from the participants and immediately sent to the lab for analysis. COVID-19 IgG antibodies were analysed using chemiluminescence immunoassay method on Architect Ci8200 (Abbott). SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. Results: All participants were males and mean age was 27.1 +/- 3.8 years. Out of 154 squad members, 24 were reactive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and performing duties at the areas of high virus exposure. None of COVID-19 IgG reactive cases exhibited symptoms and most of them performed duties at high risk areas with only masks provided as personal protective equipment. Only 10% of the participants who were exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found to have anti-COVID IgG. Conclusion: COVID-19 IgG antibody reactive cases may not show any symptoms.

Although case-based and syndromic surveillance are critical for monitoring the pandemic, these systems rely on persons obtaining testing or reporting a COVID-19-like illness. Using serologic tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an adjunctive strategy that estimates the prevalence of past infection in a population. During April 28-May 3, 2020, coinciding with the end of a statewide shelter-in-place order, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health conducted a serologic survey in DeKalb and Fulton counties in metropolitan Atlanta to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the population. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used to randomly select 30 census blocks in each county, with a target of seven participating households per census block. Weighted estimates were calculated to account for the probability of selection and adjusted for age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. A total of 394 households and 696 persons participated and had a serology result; 19 (2.7%) of 696 persons had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The estimated weighted seroprevalence across these two metropolitan Atlanta counties was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.5). Non-Hispanic black participants more commonly had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than did participants of other racial/ethnic groups (p<0.01). Among persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 13 (weighted % = 49.9; 95% CI = 24.4-75.5) reported a COVID-19-compatible illness,* six (weighted % = 28.2; 95% CI = 11.9-53.3) sought medical care for a COVID-19-compatible illness, and five (weighted % = 15.7; 95% CI = 5.1-39.4) had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating that many of these infections would not have been identified through case-based or syndromic surveillance. The relatively low seroprevalence estimate in this report indicates that most persons in the catchment area had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the survey. Continued preventive measures, including social distancing, consistent and correct use of face coverings, and hand hygiene, remain critical in controlling community spread of SARS-CoV-2.",2020,/,MMWR.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenzhen to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies including, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). In the COVID-19 group, nine patients were enrolled after diagnosis. In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was 18 March 2020. In the COVID-19 group, the seven of nine patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, six of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the six individuals were all negative. Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible.

During this epidemic, health authorities requested swab tests, while seeking new patient paths. Method(s): A dual laboratory approach was evaluated, consisting of patient care reports for viral RNA detection on swabs and rapid serological tests in 516 patients (192 symptomatic or paucisymptomatic and 324 asymptomatic). Result(s): We found the molecular positive fraction equal to 12% (23/192) among symptomatic/paucisymptomatic (S/P) and 15.4% (50/324) in asymptomatic (As) sets. Among subsets, we observed serologically positive results, corresponding to 35% (8/23) for S/P and 38% (19/50) for As. Among molecular negative cases, we detected specific Immunoglobulin G or M (Ig G or Ig M) positivity in the S/P cohort equal to 6.6% (11/167) and 6% (15/246) in As cases. For indeterminate molecular results, we found S/P serological positivity equal to 100% (1/1) and 54% (13/24) in As patients. We found higher (p < 0.05) seropositivity in older patients (n = 8) among symptomatic and positives for viral RNA (n.23). Conclusion(s): It has been observed that a dual approach of serological and molecular tests detects a higher absolute number of disease cases in a pandemic context,which could improve monitoring and health surveillance efficacy. The age-related seropositivity frequency in this study, if confirmed, could enhance the validity of serological tests, especially in older patients.In these subjects, molecular positivity accompanied by serological positivity (distinct for M and G immunoglobulins) should help determine disease status and support decisions related to patient management.Copyright © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",2020,/,Clinical Biochemistry,,"(Pancrazzi, Gervino) Laboratory Medicine Department, Molecular and Clinical Pathology Sector, Azienda USL Toscana Sudest, Ospedale San Donato, Arezzo, Italy(Magliocca, Mafucci, Cortesi, Mazzeschi, Mazzierli) Laboratory Medicine Department, Serology Sector",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.07.002,2007243936,#28983,Pancrazzi 2020,"",""

Concomitant liver disease could increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19., METHODS: We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics)., RESULTS: Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0-1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay.

M.","COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is thought to cause a milder illness in pregnancy with a greater proportion of asymptomatic carriers. This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers' characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2-26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6-55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units.

Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93.4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8.0%] of 5049)., FINDINGS: There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93.4% [95% CI 87.8-96.9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99.0% [94.6-100.0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94.0% [91.3-96.7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88.2% [95% CI 81.6-93.1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94.0% [87.4-97.8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84.7% [80.6-88.7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9.3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8.8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9.8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10.6% (95% CI 7.6-13.6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44.7% (42.0-47.4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18.0% (95% CI 17.0-18.9)., INTERPRETATION: Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing., FUNDING: None.

In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%). People who self-identified as not believing they had COVID-19 had the lowest prevalence 4.8% (95% CI 2.3%, 8.2%). The range of seroprevalence after correction for potential selection bias was 21.9% to 24.2%. This study suggests more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were not reported.

Considering the strategy of Korea entailing massive testing and contact tracing from the beginning of epidemic, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Korea may be negligible. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among individuals who were never diagnosed with COVID-19 in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea., METHODS: Serologic testing for immunoglobulin G antibody based on immunochromatographic assay was conducted in 103 patients and 95 guardians aged 18 to 82 years without any history of COVID-19 diagnosis, who visited outpatient clinics of a single university-affiliated hospital from May 25 to June 5, 2020., RESULTS: The estimated seroprevalence was 7.6% (95% confidence interval, 4.3%-12.2%) with 15 positive cases. Among them, only one had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed case among their close contacts and 13 did not experience COVID-19-related symptoms. Seroprevalence was similar between patients and guardians. Based on this figure, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Daegu was estimated to be a dozen times more than the number of confirmed cases based on PCR testing., CONCLUSION: Despite the limitation of a small and unrepresentative sample, this is the first study on seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Korea. Our study suggested that the number of undiagnosed missing cases was substantial even with the stringent strategy adopted in Korea, similar to that of other countries.

SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers of a gastroenterological service in a tertiary care facility.,"Kassem, Abdel Meguid; Talaat, Hala; Shawky, Shereen; Fouad, Rabab; Amer, Khaled; Elnagdy, Tarek; Hassan, Wael A; Tantawi, Omnia; Abdelmoniem, Reham; Gaber, Yasmine; Badary, Hedy A; Musa, Sherief","BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Frontlines healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are at increased risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in Egypt. This study aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs providing gastroenterological services., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four HCWs at the gastroenterological service of Al-Manial University Hospital, the main hospital of the largest tertiary university hospitals complex in Egypt (Kasr Al-Ainy Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University) were tested using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples, and rapid serological IgM/IgG tests (RST). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic, occupational and clinical data., RESULTS: Of the 74 HCWs, 10 tested positive by RT-PCR (13.5%). In 9/74 (12.2%) HCWs, antibodies could be detected by RST: three with both IgM and IgG lines; six with IgM line only and none with IgG line only. Frequency of positive tests was more among subjects with minor symptoms compared to completely asymptomatic HCWs (50% vs 16.1%, respectively). Neither age, gender or occupation was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in gastroenterology HCWs is 13.5% by RT-PCR. Continued measures are warranted to assure HCWs safety and reduce transmission from healthcare settings to the community during COVID-19 pandemic. Presence of positive test results among asymptomatic HCWs illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs irrespective of symptoms. Copyright © 2020 Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology.

Seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in the cleaning and oncological staff of a municipal clinic.,"Epstude, Jorg; Harsch, Igor Alexander","Aim: To prevent shedding of the novel COVID-19 virus in hospitals, strict hygiene measures and surveillance of the staff and patients is mandatory. Studying the available literature, we assumed that monitoring of the cleaning staff may sometimes be a ""blind spot"" in surveillance. Although the cleaning personnel is not entrusted with the medical and nursing care of patients, the extent of patient contacts in this group may be comparable to medical personnel and even increase in times of a visit ban in many hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections already undergone in this group. Methods: Antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured in the cleaning staff from June 15th to 30th, 2020 in our clinic. Antibodies against COVID-19 were determined using ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). For purposes of comparison, the same procedure was performed in the staff of the oncology ward, who were regarded as an important group due to their high-risk patients. Results: During the study period, 45 members of the cleaning staff and 20 members of the oncology ward were tested. Significantly elevated IgA antibody titers were detected in 1 person in the first group and in 1 person in the second group. Significantly elevated IgG antibody titers were not detected in the first group and in 1 person of the second group. In case of positive or indeterminate testing, swabs for direct virus detection were taken, but were negative in all cases. Conclusion:  The prevalence of already undergone infections in both groups is low, as to be expected due to the still low incidence of COVID-19 infections in the German federal state of Thuringia. However, the presence of such antibodies in the cleaning personnel demonstrates the need for equally strict surveillance in this group.

Despite these interventions, confirmed COVID-19 infection rates have been high in the United Kingdom. Prevalence of asymptomatic disease in an adult hemodialysis population has not been reported. Also, to our knowledge, the development of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been previously reported in this population. Although serologic testing does not provide information on the infectivity of patients, seroprevalence studies may enable investigation of exposure within dialysis units and hence, assessment of current screening strategies., METHODS: To investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a hemodialysis population, we used the Abbott IgG assay with the Architect system to test serum samples from 356 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., RESULTS: Of 356 patients, 121 had been symptomatic when screened before a dialysis session and received an RT-PCR test; 79 (22.2% of the total study population) tested positive for COVID-19. Serologic testing of all 356 patients found 129 (36.2%) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Only two patients with PCR-confirmed infection did not seroconvert. Of the 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 52 (40.3%) had asymptomatic disease or undetected disease by PCR testing alone., CONCLUSIONS: We found a high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. Serologic evidence of previous infection in asymptomatic or PCR-negative patients suggests that current diagnostic screening strategies may be limited in their ability to detect acute infection.

U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged >=12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70).

Large-scale seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected., Objective: To estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convenience samples from several geographic sites in the US., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages. The serum was collected from March 23 through May 12, 2020, for routine clinical testing by 2 commercial laboratory companies. Sites of collection were San Francisco Bay area, California; Connecticut; south Florida; Louisiana; Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Minnesota; Missouri; New York City metro area, New York; Philadelphia metro area, Pennsylvania; Utah; and western Washington State., Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and estimates were standardized to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). The number of infections in each site was estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations; estimated infections were compared with the number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases as of last specimen collection date., Results: Serum samples were tested from 16025 persons, 8853 (55.2%) of whom were women; 1205 (7.5%) were 18 years or younger and 5845 (36.2%) were 65 years or older. Most specimens from each site had no evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Adjusted estimates of the proportion of persons seroreactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies ranged from 1.0% in the San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) to 6.9% of persons in New York City (collected March 23-April 1).

Lower prevalence of antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in group O French blood donors,Gallian P.; Pastorino B.; Morel P.; Chiaroni J.; Ninove L.; de Lamballerie X.,"We investigated the distribution of antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 according to age, sex or blood group in French blood donors. In 464 samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2017 and 2018), our virus neutralization assay had a 100% specificity. It was used to test 998 samples collected from blood donors during the last week of March or the first week of April 2020. As expected at this stage of the outbreak, the prevalence was low (2.7%) and, importantly, criteria for blood donation imply that the vast majority of seropositives had asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Seroprevalence values did not differ significantly among age groups (but were slightly higher in donors <30yo and >=60yo), and between males and females (2.82% vs 2.69%), unlike what has been observed regarding hospitalizations admission to ICU and death rates in France. By contrast, we observed that the proportion of seropositives was significantly lower in group O donors (1.32% vs 3.86% in other donors, p = 0.014). We conclude that virus infection seems to occur with a similar incidence in men and women among French blood donors, but that blood group O persons are less at risk of being infected and not only of suffering from severe clinical presentations, as previously suggested.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2020,,Antiviral Res.,181,"(Gallian, Pastorino, Ninove, de Lamballerie) Unite des Virus Emergents, (UVE: Aix-Marseille Univ-IRD 190-INSERM 1207-IHU Mediterranee Infection), Marseille, France",104880,,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104880,,#28925,Gallian 2020,"",""

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese MHD patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened by blood tests, chest computed tomography, NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME(S): Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL: Approach Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to with positive serology tests and negative NAT. RESULT(S): Of the 1027 MHD patients, 99 cases have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 infection, equivalent to a prevalence of 9.6%. In the 99 cases, 52 (53%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (48%) patients were identified by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with negative NAT. The spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients showed IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (75%), and both positive IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). 51% of the infected patients were asymptomatic during the epidemic. Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often identified with infection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and they tended to be more symptomatic than other patient groups. LIMITATIONS: Possibility of false positives and false negatives for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSION(S): Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in MHD patients were subclinical and unidentified by universal chest CT and selective NAT.

As a point-of-care immunodiagnostic test for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the serosurvey represents an alternative to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to measure the magnitude of COVID-19 outbreak in the communities lacking sufficient diagnostic capability for PCR testing. Methods: We assessed seropositivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG between April 21 and May 20, 2020, at 2 primary care clinics in Tokyo, Japan. Results: The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76-5.16) for the entire cohort (n = 1071). The 23 special wards of central Tokyo exhibited a significantly higher prevalence compared with the other areas of Tokyo after classification by residence (P = .02, 4.68% [3.08-6.79] vs 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). In central Tokyo, the southern area showed the highest seroprevalence compared with the other areas (7.92% [3.48-15.01]), corresponding to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients by PCR test reported by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first post-stratification weighting then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing diagnoses by estimated infection-experienced adults., RESULTS: Based on 1,887 of 15,101 reactive results (12.5%), estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults.

We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey., METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission., RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff.

Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool.

Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level., METHODS: 35 883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants (75.1% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test)., FINDINGS: Seroprevalence was 5.0% (95% CI 4.7-5.4) by the point-of-care test and 4.6% (4.3-5.0) by immunoassay, with a specificity-sensitivity range of 3.7% (3.3-4.0; both tests positive) to 6.2% (5.8-6.6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years (<3.1% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid (>10%) and lower in coastal areas (<3%).

In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15.3% (13.8-16.8) to 19.3% (17.7-21.0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21.9% (19.1-24.9) to 35.8% (33.1-38.5). Only 19.5% (16.3-23.2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test., INTERPRETATION: The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic. These results emphasise the need for maintaining public health measures to avoid a new epidemic wave., FUNDING: Spanish Ministry of Health, Institute of Health Carlos III, and Spanish National Health System.

To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy.

METHODS Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. This study reports crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, population weighted prevalence for the state, and prevalence adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models were used to establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. For the analysis, we considered collection period and site, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. RESULTS The proportion of positive tests for SARS-Cov-2, without any adjustment, was 4.0% (95%CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.1-4.5%). We found lower estimates after adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity: 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence, and 3.3% (95%CI 2.6-4.1%) for the weighted prevalence. Collection period was the variable most significantly associated with crude prevalence: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, the younger the blood donor, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the education level, the higher the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 antibody. We found similar results for weighted prevalence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings comply with some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, as the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise; and the higher prevalence among both the youngest, for moving around more than older age groups, and the less educated, for encountering more difficulties in following social distancing recommendations.

We report epidemiologic data from a study investigating a cohort of women who became pregnant just before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11-13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples. COVID-19 cumulative incidence during the first trimester was of 10.1% with high prevalence of asymptomatic patients (42.8%).

Covid-19 exposure risk for family members of healthcare workers: an observational study.,"Dioscoridi, Lorenzo; Carrisi, Chiara","BACKGROUND: Many papers considered the exposure risk to COVID-19 of general population and healthcare workers (HW). However, no available papers discussed the risk of exposure of family members (FM) of HWs., AIMS: The present study collected the data of SARS-COV-2 positive FM of HWs using serological rapid IgM/IgG tests (SRT) compared with positive HWs at SRT and serological quantitative IgG test (SQT)., METHODS: The study was conducted from 2nd to 31th May 2020. 38 HWs were tested by both SRT and SQT; 81 FMs were screened using SRT. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data., RESULTS: Of the 38 HWs, 2 (5,3%) showed IgG line at SRT, confirmed by SQT. 32 HWs decided self-isolation from the family during SARS-COV-2 spreading. Out of 81 FMs, 26 (32,1%) were found IgG positive at SRT. 11 (42%) of them had symptoms typical for COVID-19 in the study period. In two families, the HWs were the only negative case., CONCLUSIONS: General population's exposure to COVID-19 was less controlled than HWs' one. HWs experienced lower infection's rate than their families and did not represented a risk of transmission for relatives. Copyright © 2020.

The diagnostic value of rapid anti IgM and IgG detecting tests in the identification of patients with SARS CoV-2 virus infection,Barna V.; Katalin K.; Eszter O.; Dora S.; Zoltan P.; Bela M.,"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim(s): We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method(s): Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.Copyright © 2020 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

Such loss could be prevented if there is a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHOD(S): Using CHO cell expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreaks or during the outbreak, and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULT(S): The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during the hospitalization and after been discharged for two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 out of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and one out of five nucleic acid test-negative ""Close contacts"" of COVID-19 patient.

Objective(s): We sought to analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. Method(s): Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. Result(s): None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells.

In late March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt arrived at port in Guam after numerous U.S. service members onboard developed COVID-19. In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity. This report improves the understanding of COVID-19 in the U.S. military and among young adults in congregate settings and reinforces the importance of preventive measures to lower risk for infection in similar environments.",2020,,MMWR Morb.

Testing for COVID-19: a few points to remember.,"Kratka, Zuzana; Luxova, Stepanka; Malickova, Karin; Furst, Tomas; Simkova, Halina","Diagnostic approaches to COVID-19 include clinical history, PCR tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of antibodies. By combining these three approaches, the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be examined in healthcare teams. The aim of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of healthcare professionals 6 - 8 weeks after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the Czech Republic. A total of 269 subjects were enrolled in the study (187 women, 82 men) with a median age of 45.9 years (21 - 71 years). We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection. Blood samples were collected, and IgG levels were analysed in all samples. The level of IgA antibodies was analysed in those positive for IgG. PCR testing was performed in cases testing positive for presence of antibodies. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17 % of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8 % reported history of international travel. There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %). There was only one PCR positive subject. Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 serology in the entire personnel of a COVID-19-free otolaryngology department in a highly affected area. The aim was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among staff to clarify the impact of different risk factors for infection. The entire staff of the otolaryngology unit was tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Symptomatic staff members were tested with nasal/pharyngeal swabs. All answered a survey focused on the number of in- and extrahospital positive contacts and type of activities in the unit. Five (9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The only variable associated with a higher risk of infection was the number of extrahospital contacts without personal protective equipment (P =.008). Our study shows that in non-COVID-19 departments, the use of adequate personal protective equipment leads to low rates of infection among health care workers.

Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHOD(S): The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sante study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4.8% (95% CI 2.4-8.0, n=341). The estimate increased to 8.5% (5.9-11.4, n=469) in the second week, to 10.9% (7.9-14.4, n=577) in the third week, 6.6% (4.3-9.4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10.8% (8.2-13.9, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5-9 years (relative risk [RR] 0.32 [95% CI 0.11-0.63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0.50 [0.28-0.78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20-49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11.6 infections in the community. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2.5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5-9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10-64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

"Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence in Boise, Idaho",Bryan A.; Pepper G.; Wener M.H.; Fink S.L.; Morishima C.; Chaudhary A.; Jerome K.R.; Mathias P.C.; Greninger A.L.,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.

Prevalence of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff,Schmidt S.B.; Gruter L.; Boltzmann M.; Rollnik J.D.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic threatens health care providers and society. For planning of treatment capacities, it is of major importance to obtain reliable information on infection and fatality rates of the novel coronavirus. A German community study, the so-called Heinsberg study, found a 5-fold higher infection rate (and thus a remarkably lower fatality rate) than the officially reported cases suggest. We were interested to examine the SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody status among clinic staff of a large neurological center in Northern Germany. Blood samples and questionnaires (demographic data, medical history) were collected pseudonymously. In total, 406 out of 525 (77.3%) of our employees participated in the study. The infection rate among the staff was as high as 2.7%. Including drop-outs (missing questionnaire but test result available), the infection rate was even higher (2.9%). Only 36% of the positively tested employees did suffer from flu-like symptoms in 2020. None of the nurses-having closest and longest contact to patients-were found to be positive. Despite the fact that the infection rate among clinic staff may not be directly compared to the situation in the surrounding county (due to different testing procedures), one might hypothesize that the infection rate could be more than 30-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for the county of Hameln-Pyrmont.

To estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, we evaluated the host serologic response, measured by the levels of immunoglobulins M and G in 17,368 individuals, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and geographic regions in the country, during the period from 9 March 2020 to 10 April 2020. In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5-4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5-2.3%, 95% CI), respectively.

Anesthesiologists' and intensive care providers' exposure to COVID-19 infection in a New York City academic center: a prospective cohort study assessing symptoms and COVID-19 antibody testing,Morcuende M.; Guglielminotti J.; Landau R.,"BACKGROUND: Protecting first-line healthcare providers against work-related COVID-19 infection at the onset of the pandemic has been a crucial challenge in the United States. Anesthesiologists in particular are considered at risk, since aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and extubation, have been shown to significantly increase the odds for respiratory infections during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. This study assessed the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms and presence of COVID-19 antibodies after work-related COVID-19 exposures, among physicians working in a large academic hospital in New York City (NYC). METHOD(S): An e-mail survey was addressed to anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center on April 15, 2020. The survey assessed 4 domains: 1) demographics and medical history, 2) community exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., use of NYC subway), 3) work-related exposure to COVID-19, and 4) development of COVID-19-like symptoms after work exposure. The first 100 survey responders were invited to undergo a blood test to assess antibody status (presence of IgM/IgG specific to COVID-19). Work-related exposure was defined as any episode where the provider was not wearing adequate personal protective equipment (airborne or droplet/contact protection depending on the exposure type). Based on the clinical scenario, work exposure was categorized as high-risk (e.g., exposure during intubation) or low-risk (e.g., exposure during doffing). RESULT(S): 205 healthcare providers were contacted and 105 completed the survey (51%); 91 completed the serological test. Sixty-one of the respondents (58%) reported at least one work-related exposure and 54% of the exposures were high-risk. Among respondents reporting a work-related exposure, 16 (26.2%) reported post-exposure COVID-19-like symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were myalgia (9 cases), diarrhea (8 cases), fever (7 cases), and sore throat (7 cases). COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 11 of the 91 tested respondents (12.1%), with no difference between respondents with (11.8%) or without (12.5%) a work- related exposure, including high-risk exposure. Compared with antibody negative respondents, antibody positive respondents were more likely to use NYC subway to commute to work and report COVID-19-like symptoms in the last 90 days. CONCLUSION(S): In the epicenter of the United States' pandemic and within 6-8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion of anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers reported COVID-19-like symptoms after a work-related exposure and even fewer had detectable COVID-19 antibodies.

Prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 Infection in Health Workers (HWs) and Diagnostic Test Performance: The Experience of a Teaching Hospital in Central Italy.,"Lahner, Edith; Dilaghi, Emanuele; Prestigiacomo, Claudio; Alessio, Giuliano; Marcellini, Laura; Simmaco, Maurizio; Santino, Iolanda; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Anibaldi, Paolo; Marcolongo, Adriano; Annibale, Bruno; Napoli, Christian","(1) Background: Health workers (HWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infections. Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19-69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. High awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mandatory for all people, but especially for HWs, irrespective of symptoms, to safeguard their health and that of patients.",2020,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,12,,,10.3390/ijerph17124417,,#11962,Lahner 2020,"",""
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection in healthcare workers in Germany with direct contact to COVID-19 patients,Korth J.; Wilde B.; Dolff S.; Anastasiou O.E.; Krawczyk A.; Jahn M.; Cordes S.; Ross B.; Esser S.; Lindemann M.; Kribben A.; Dittmer U.; Witzke O.; Herrmann A.,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a severe respiratory manifestation, COVID-19, and presents a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Result(s): In 5 of 316 (1.6 %) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group (2/37 (5.4 %) vs. 3/244 (1.2 %), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20 %) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6 %). The data indicate that the local hygiene standard might be effective.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,J. Clin.

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of oncological HCP and their patients has significant implications for oncological care., METHODS: HCP and patients with cancer at the Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna were included between 21 March and 4 June and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Reactive samples were confirmed or disproved by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. Additionally, a structured questionnaire regarding basic demographic parameters, travel history and COVID-19-associated symptoms had to be completed by HCP., RESULTS: 146 subjects (62 HCP and 84 patients with cancer) were enrolled. In the oncological HCP cohort, 20 (32.3%) subjects were medical oncologists, 28 (45.2%) nurses at our ward and 14 (22.6%) fulfil other functions such as study coordinators. In the patient cohort, most individuals are on active anticancer treatment (96.4%). 26% of the HCP and 6% of the patients had symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 since the end of February 2020. However, only in 2 (3.2%) HCP and in 3 (3.6%) patients, anti-SARS-Cov-2 total antibodies were detected. The second assay for anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies confirmed the positive result in all HCP and in 2 (2.4%) patients, suggesting an initial assay's unspecific reaction in one case. In individuals with a confirmed test result, an active COVID-19 infection was documented by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR test., CONCLUSION: Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found solely in persons after a documented SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, thus supporting the test methods' high sensitivity and specificity. The low prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our cohorts indicates a lack of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the need for continued strict safety measures to prevent uncontrolled viral spread among oncological HCPs and patients with cancer. Copyright © Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

"Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China",Xu R.; Huang J.; Duan C.; Liao Q.; Shan Z.; Wang M.; Rong X.; Li C.; Fu Y.; Wang H. ,"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August, 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of outbreak is a serious public concern. In this study, we used ELISA to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2,199 blood donors who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time PCR. Among the 2,199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2/2,199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA.

High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in elderly care employees in Sweden.,"Lindahl, Johanna F; Hoffman, Tove; Esmaeilzadeh, Mouna; Olsen, Bjorn; Winter, Reidar; Amer, Stefan; Molnar, Christian; Svalberg, Ann; Lundkvist, Ake","The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and spread in the Swedish elderly care system during April 2020. The increasing number of employees on sick-leave due to COVID-19 created severe logistic problems. Some elderly care homes therefore started to screen their personnel to secure the safety of the elderly and to avoid unnecessary quarantine of potentially immune employees. Secondary data from a screening with a COVID-19 rapid test for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG of 1,005 employees in 22 elderly care homes in Stockholm, Sweden, were analyzed. Seropositive employees were found in 21 out of the 22 care homes. In total, 23% (231/1,005) of the employees tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 14.3% (144/1,005) were found positive for IgM (either alone or combined with IgG), indicating recent or present infection. Of those that tested seropositive, 46.5% did not report any clinical symptoms, indicating pre- or asymptomatic infections. Reported symptoms with the highest correlation with seropositivity were fever and loss of smell and taste. These results suggest that antibody testing of employees in elderly care homes is valuable for surveillance of disease development and a crucial screening tool in the effort to decrease the death toll in this pandemic.

Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in residents of Karachi-challenges in acquiring herd immunity for COVID 19,Zaidi S.; Rizwan F.; Riaz Q.; Siddiqui A.; Khawaja S.; Imam M.; Naz A.; Waheed S.; Shamsi T. ,"BACKGROUND: The recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global emergency. There is large number of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 that are not reported. Hence, serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies is warranted for a better estimation of the actual number of infected patients to limit the disease spread and to get an idea of herd immunity. METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood Diseases at Pakistan. The study includes healthcare workers (HCWs), community and industrial workers. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. RESULT(S): A total of 1675 samples have been received from three groups of population. The percentage positivity for industrial employees is high (50.3%) for HCW (13.2%) and community population (34%).Total percentage for positive antibodies result is ~36%. CONCLUSION(S): Our seroprevalence is 36%, which still far from herd immunity that needs to be at least 60-70% in population. If we consider acquiring 60% seroprevalence in next few months, then herd immunity is not far from reality, provided the antibodies did not decline with time. Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest a study with larger population to implement stronger and targeted interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we performed a pilot study of four serological assays to assess the amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples obtained from 491 healthy individuals before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 51 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, 209 suspected cases of COVID-19 with mild symptoms, and 200 healthy blood donors. We used two ELISA assays that recognized the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric spike (S) protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we developed the S-Flow assay that recognized the S protein expressed at the cell surface using flow cytometry, and the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay that recognized diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens including the 51 domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of N by immunoprecipitation.We obtained similar results with the four serological assays. Differences in sensitivity were attributed to the technique and the antigen used. High anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were associated with neutralization activity, which was assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotype virus. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, seroconversion and virus neutralization occurred between 5 and 14 days after symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 32% of mildly symptomatic individuals within 15 days of symptom onset and in 3% of healthy blood donors. The four antibody assays that we used enabled a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different subpopulations within one region.",2020,,SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,12,559,,,10.1126/scitranslmed.abc3103,,#36013,Grzelak 2020,"",""

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) followed in the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc were rapidly isolated before the government lockdown., METHODS: After the peak of the epidemy, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in 149 patients and collected clinical data., RESULTS: Only 3 asymptomatic patients presented IgG against the virus. In one patient hospitalized for COVID-19 (positive molecular testing), we did not detect any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as in thirty-five other symptomatic patients considered as possible cases., CONCLUSIONS: Even if respiratory symptoms linked to CF are frequent and compatible with COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected only in 3 asymptomatic patients. This reassuring study concerning the risk of COVID-19 in patients with CF illustrates the difficulty to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from respiratory exacerbations and the need of generalized molecular testing to make a precise diagnosis.

Despite the prevailing pandemic, there are no recommendations available as yet for testing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of blood screening., OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV-2 antibodies, its clinical significance and to identify if total antibodies(IgA, IgM, IgG) should be tested or just the specific IgG antibodies only., METHOD: Consecutive blood donors donated were screened for standard serological panel of HbsAg, Anti-HCV, Anti-HIV and Syphilis using Cobas-411 analyser and Malaria. All seronegative donors were then screened for COVID serology using the same instrument. These results were compared with the blood donors' seroprevalence checked in a cohort in the first week of June 2020. Pre-COVID-19 period (October 2019) blood donors' archived samples were also compared. Donors who were positive on ECLIA were then tested for specific antibodies (IgM or IgG) by ELISA., RESULTS: A total of 380 healthy blood donors were included. All were males with the mean age being 30.6 +/- 6.3 years. Ten pre-pandemic samples did not show COVID-19 antibodies, whereas out of 70 samples in the 3rd week of June, only 15 (21.4 %) were positive. However, in July out of the 300 blood donors, 113 (37.7 %) were found to be reactive. To reconfirm our findings, these 113 donors were then tested on ELISA for presence of IgG specifically. Out of these 128 samples, 81 were IgG positive, 23 were borderline positive and 24 were negative., CONCLUSION: Almost 40 % of blood donors are now seroconverted for COVID-19.

Here, we aim to clarify the epidemiologic and influencing factors of asymptomatic carriers in the general population. Method(s): In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. Finding(s): A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. Interpretation(s): To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India. Method(s): From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity. Result(s): Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases. The IFR in the surveyed districts from high stratum, where death reporting was more robust, was 11.72 (95% CI: 7.21-19.19) to 15.04 (9.26-24.62) per 10,000 adults, using May 24 and June 1, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported deaths. Interpretation & conclusions: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was low among the adult population in India around the beginning of May 2020.

Oncology units should implement all possible preventive measures to reduce the risk of viral transmission by healthcare professionals (HCPs) to patients. We conducted a surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection among the staff members of the Medical Oncology Unit of ASST Spedali Civili in Brescia, one of the Italian areas most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether the recommended preventive measures, promptly implemented by the unit, have been effective in reducing the spread of the virus among the HCPs. Between February 24 and May 19, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 10 out of 76 healthy HCPs (13%). Six of them developed a symptomatic disease, leading to home quarantine, and four remained asymptomatic. The infection was revealed when a serology test was performed on all staff members of the unit. In seven HCPs, in which it was possible to trace the person-to-person infection, the contagion occurred as a result of unprotected contacts or partially protected with surgical masks. In particular, four asymptomatic HCPs did not stop working, but a widespread outbreak in the unit was avoided. Adherence to the recommended preventive strategies, in particular, wearing of surgical masks by both the HCPs and the patients, is effective in reducing and preventing the viral spread.© Copyright © 2020 Dalla Volta, Valcamonico, Pedersini, Fornaro, Tovazzi, Monteverdi, Baggi, Consoli, Ferrari, Grisanti, Conti, Amoroso, Bossi and Berruti.",2020,/,Frontiers in Oncology,10,"(Dalla Volta, Valcamonico, Pedersini, Fornaro, Tovazzi, Monteverdi, Baggi, Consoli, Ferrari, Grisanti, Conti, Amoroso, Bossi, Berruti) Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, Public Health, University ",1574,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01574,632723552,#33595,DallaVolta 2020,"",""

COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers: Serological Findings Supporting Routine Testing.,"Stock, Ariel D; Bader, Edward R; Cezayirli, Phillip; Inocencio, Julio; Chalmers, Samantha A; Yassari, Reza; Yanamadala, Vijay; Eskandar, Emad","A growing body of evidence demonstrates that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 hotspots have faced numerous challenges, including shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and difficulties acquiring clinical testing. The magnitude of the exposure of healthcare workers and the potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to understand the incidence of infection in this population. To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers, we studied frontline staff working in the Montefiore Health System in New York City. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were tested by RT-qPCR and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The medical, occupational, and COVID-19 exposure histories of participants were recorded via questionnaires. Of the 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers tested, 19 (19.4%) tested positive by RT-qPCR and/or ELISA. Within this group, four (4.1%) were RT-qPCR positive, and four (4.1%) were PCR and IgG positive. Notably, an additional 11 (11.2%) individuals were IgG positive without a positive PCR. Two PCR positive individuals subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms, while all others remained asymptomatic at 2-week follow-up. These results indicate that there is considerable asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare workforce, despite current mitigation policies. Furthermore, presuming that asymptomatic staff are not carrying SARS-CoV-2 is inconsistent with our results, and this could result in amplified transmission within healthcare settings. Consequently, aggressive testing regiments, such as testing frontline healthcare workers on a regular, multi-modal basis, may be required to prevent further spread within the workforce and to patients.

METHOD(S): We measured antibodies in serum samples from 30,576 persons in Iceland, using six assays (including two pan-immunoglobulin [pan-Ig] assays), and we determined that the appropriate measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. We tested 2102 samples collected from 1237 persons up to 4 months after diagnosis by a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay. We measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed. RESULT(S): Of the 1797 persons who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1107 of the 1215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive; antiviral antibody titers assayed by two pan-Ig assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis by qPCR and remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study. Of quarantined persons, 2.3% were seropositive; of those with unknown exposure, 0.3% were positive. We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection was fatal in 0.3%. We also estimate that 56% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR, 14% had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR (or who had not received a positive result, if tested), and 30% had occurred in persons outside quarantine and not tested with qPCR. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate that antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis.

METHOD(S): between April 15 and 25, 2020, naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography to the HCWs of the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella of the units involved in patient care with CoVID-19: Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. RESULT(S): 498 HCWs were studied. Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive. Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected.

Method(s): A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. Result(s): Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. Conclusion(s): We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors,Erikstrup C.; Hother C.E.; Pedersen O.B.V.; Molbak K.; Skov R.L.; Holm D.K.; Saekmose S.G.; Nilsson A.C.; Brooks P.T.; Boldsen J.K.; Mikkelsen C.; Gybel-Brask M.; Sorensen E.; Dinh K.M.; Mikkelsen S.; Moller B.K.; Haunstrup T.; Harritshoj L.; Jensen B.A.; Hjalgrim H.; Lillevang S.T.; Ullum H.,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. METHOD(S): Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to May 3 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULT(S): The first 20,640 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (CI: 0.8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 89 per 100,000 (CI: 72-211) infections. CONCLUSION(S): The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

High SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients,Tong X.; Wang J.; Huang W.; Yin S.; Huang R.; Yang H.; Huang A.; Liu Y.; Chen Y.; Yuan L.; Yan X.; Shen H.; Wu C.,"The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined among 105 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to four patients who were laboratory confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14th day of the quarantine, while the serum samples were obtained on the 14th day of the quarantine. With the assay of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and microneutralization assay, 17.14% (18/105) of HCWs were seropositive, while their swab samples were found to be SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Risk analysis revealed that wearing face mask could reduce the infection risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.127, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017, 0.968), while when exposed to COVID-19 patients, doctors might have higher risk of seroconversion (OR, 346.837, 95% CI 8.924, 13479.434), compared with HCWs exposed to colleagues as well as nurses and general service assistants who exposed to patients. Our study revealed that the serological testing is useful for the identification of asymptomatic or subclinical infection of SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts with COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 The British Infection Association",2020,,J.

Dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and seroprevalence among high-risk health care workers and hospital staff.,"Martin, Charlotte; Montesinos, Isabel; Dauby, Nicolas; Gilles, Christine; Dahma, Hafid; Van Den Wijngaert, Sigi; De Wit, Stephane; Delforge, Marc; Clumeck, Nathan; Vandenberg, Olivier",Staff members from Covid-19 highly exposed units were invited to participate in a six month study of SARS-CoV-2 carriage and seroprevalence. The results of Day 1 and Day 15 visits show that 41 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology in 326 participants (overall infection rate=12.6%). Having co-morbidity or symptoms at the time of collection was a risk factor for infection but not working as a physician/nurse. This universal screening in high-risk units irrespective of symptoms allowed asymptomatic and potentially contagious infected workers to be self-isolated during 7 days. Copyright © 2020.

"Use of personal protective equipment against coronavirus disease 2019 by healthcare professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross sectional study",Liu M.; Cheng S.-Z.; Xu K.-W.; Yang Y.; Zhu Q.-T.; Zhang H.; Yang D.-Y.; Cheng S.-Y.; Xiao H.; Wang J.-W.; Yao H.-R.; Cong Y.-T.; Zhou Y.-Q.; Peng S.; Kuang M.; Hou F.-F.; Cheng K.K.; Xiao H.-P.,"Objective To examine the protective effects of appropriate personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare professionals who provided care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design Cross sectional study. Setting Four hospitals in Wuhan, China. Participants 420 healthcare professionals (116 doctors and 304 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan by two affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-sen University and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University for 6-8 weeks from 24 January to 7 April 2020. These study participants were provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to deliver healthcare to patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and were involved in aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals with no exposure history to covid-19 and 80 patients who had recovered from covid-19 were recruited to verify the accuracy of antibody testing. Main outcome measures Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) and evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as a positive test for virus specific nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs, or a positive test for IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum samples. Results The average age of study participants was 35.8 years and 68.1% (286/420) were women. These study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts for an average of 5.4 days a week; they worked an average of 16.2 hours each week in intensive care units. All 420 study participants had direct contact with patients with covid-19 and performed at least one aerosol generating procedure. During the deployment period in Wuhan, none of the study participants reported covid-19 related symptoms. When the participants returned home, they all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids and IgM or IgG antibodies (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.7%). Conclusion Before a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, healthcare professionals remain susceptible to covid-19. Despite being at high risk of exposure, study participants were appropriately protected and did not contract infection or develop protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare systems must give priority to the procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment, and provide adequate training to healthcare professionals in its use.
