0	Racial and Workplace Disparities in Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. By using paired molecular and antibody testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we determined point prevalence and seroprevalence in Louisiana, USA, during the second phase of reopening. Infections were highly variable by race and ethnicity, work environment, and ZIP code. Census-weighted seroprevalence was 3.6%, and point prevalence was 3.0%.	included
0	Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody of Patients in Local Affected Area During the Lockdown. <h4>Background: </h4> Serosurvalence is crucial in estimating the range of SARS-CoV-2 infections, predicting the possibility of another wave, and decide on a vaccination strategy. To understand the herd immunity after the COVID-19 pandemic, the seroprevalence was measured in 3062 individuals with or without COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> The levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgM and IgG were measured by the immuno-colloidal gold method. <h4>Results: </h4>: The mean seroprevalence for IgM and IgG in all participants was 2.81% and 7.51%, respectively. The positive rate of IgG was significantly higher in women than in men (P<0.05). The highest positive rate of IgM was observed in 41-60 years of age (3.49%), while the highest seroprevalence for IgG was observed in persons >60 years of age (8.61%). The positive rates of IgM and IgG in the convalescent patients were 31.82% and 77.27%, respectively, which was significantly higher than individuals with suspected syndromes or individuals without any clinical signs (P<0.01). Seroprevalence for IgG in medical staff was markedly higher than those in residents. The seroprevalence in patients with various comorbidity was no significant difference (P>0.05). <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The low positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and NA test indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is subsiding after three months, and the possibility of reintroduction of the virus from an unidentified natural reservoir is low. Seroprevalence provides the information for humoral immunity and vaccine in the future.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroprevalence Among Maintenance Dialysis Patients in the United States. Rationale & Objective: Reported COVID-19 cases underestimate the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients receiving maintenance dialysis are at high risk for COVID-19, and higher case rates have been reported relative to the general population. To better understand infection patterns, we performed a seroprevalence study among maintenance dialysis patients at a large dialysis organization in the United States., Study Design: Cross-sectional., Setting & Participants: We measured IgG antibodies in an IRB-approved study of remnant serum samples collected for routine laboratory screenings in a national sample of 12,932 maintenance dialysis patients (27 May-01 Jul 2020)., Exposure: State, sex, age, and race., Outcomes: Seropositivity; ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 case rate., Analytic Approach: Seropositivity was calculated overall and by state, sex, age, and race. Ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was calculated overall and by state., Results: Overall, 747 (5.8%) of samples were seropositive. Seroprevalence varied by state and was lowest in Kentucky (1.0%) but highest in New York (23.6%). Seroprevalence was similar among men and women. Among samples from patients < 70 years, 6.0%-6.5% were seropositive; whereas 5.2% and 3.9% of samples from patients 70-79 and >= 80 years, respectively, were seropositive. Samples from Black and Hispanic patients were 7.3% and 7.7% positive, respectively, compared to 2.8% of samples from White patients. After adjustment, risk differences among racial groups were lower, but not eliminated. During the study period, the known COVID-19 case rate was 3.3%. The ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was 1.7., Limitations: Imperfect assay sensitivity; results represent infections occurring before July 2020; deidentification prevented comparison of antibodies to previous COVID-19 status for individual patients; may not generalize to patients dialyzing with other providers or in other countries., Conclusions: Seroprevalence was 5.8% among dialysis patients as of 01 July 2020. This indicates the actual number of infections was 1.7-times greater than reported cases. This ratio is lower than reported in the general population, suggesting there were fewer unknown infections among maintenance dialysis patients.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Post-First Wave among Primary Care Physicians in Catania (Italy). Family physicians or pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) work in non-hospital settings. GPs usually visit many patients, frequently at their homes, with low potential, if any, to control the work setting. Particularly during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, they were not informed about the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with inadequate information regarding the risk, a lack of suitable protective measures and, in some cases, deficient or poor accessibility to personal protective equipment (PPE). During the first wave of COVID-19, primary care physicians were on the front line and isolated the first cases of the disease. The present study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 133 GPs working in Catania (Italy) after the first wave of COVID-19. Serological analysis revealed a low seroprevalence (3%) among GPs. The low seroprevalence highlighted in the results can be attributed to correct management of patients by GPs in the first wave. It is now hoped that mass vaccination, combined with appropriate behavior and use of PPE, can help further reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in England following the first peak of the pandemic. England has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affecting people from disadvantaged and ethnic minority communities. It is unclear how much of this excess is due to differences in exposure associated with structural inequalities. Here, we report from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) national study of over 100,000 people. After adjusting for test characteristics and re-weighting to the population, overall antibody prevalence is 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1). An estimated 3.4 million people had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-July 2020. Prevalence is two- to three-fold higher among health and care workers compared with non-essential workers, and in people of Black or South Asian than white ethnicity, while age- and sex-specific infection fatality ratios are similar across ethnicities. Our results indicate that higher hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in minority ethnic groups may reflect higher rates of infection rather than differential experience of disease or care.	included
0	The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural southwest community. Context: The true prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been difficult to determine due to limited testing, inconsistent symptom severity, and asymptomatic infections. Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population., Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community., Methods: A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing., Results: A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest. Further large-scale antibody testing is needed to determine the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the rural setting.	included
0	Retrospective study of COVID-19 seroprevalence among tissue donors at the onset of the outbreak before implementation of strict lockdown measures in France. Background The COVID-19 pandemic has altered organ and tissue donations as well as transplantation practices. SARS-CoV-2 serological tests could help in the selection of donors. We assessed COVID-19 seroprevalence in a population of tissue donors, at the onset of the outbreak in France, before systematic screening of donors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods 235 tissue donors at the Lille Tissue Bank between November 1, 2019 and March 16, 2020 were included. Archived serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two FDA-approved kits. Results Most donors were at higher risks for severe COVID-19 illness including age over 65 years (142/235) and/or presence of co-morbidities (141/235). According to the COVID-19 risk assessment of transmission, 183 out of 235 tissue donors presented with a low risk level and 52 donors with an intermediate risk level of donor derived infection. Four out of the 235 (1.7%) tested specimens were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 2 donors with anti-N protein IgG and 2 other donors with anti-S protein total Ig. None of them had both type of antibodies. Conclusion Regarding the seroprevalence among tissue donors, we concluded that the transmission probability to recipient via tissue products was very low at the beginning of the outbreak.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancy: A cohort study. STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in first trimester pregnancy have an impact on the fetal development as measured by nuchal translucency thickness and pregnancy loss? SUMMARY ANSWER: Nuchal translucency thickness at the first trimester scan was not significantly different in pregnant women with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnant women are more vulnerable to viral infections. Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1019 women with a double test taken between 17 February and 23 April 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between 14 April and 21 May 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving ~12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16) versus negative (n = 966) (P = 0.62). There was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, P = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning COVID-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies. Follow-up studies are needed to establish any risk to a fetus exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

0	Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Iquitos, Loreto, Peru. <h4>Background: </h4> Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people at risk is critical for understanding both the prior transmission of COVID-19 and vulnerability of the population to the continuing transmission and, when done serially, the intensity of ongoing transmission over an interval in a community. In this study, we estimated the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort of Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March 2020. <h4>Methods:</h4> We conducted a population-based study of transmission tested each participant using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test from Orient Gene Biotech and used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. Here we report results from the baseline (13 to 18 July 2020) and the first month of follow-up (13 to 18 August 2020) study. Findings: We enrolled a total of 716 participants and estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0%-73.4%), a test-re-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0%-68.3%), and an incidence of new exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.2%) data that suggest that transmission is ongoing but is occurring at low levels. We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants 18 to 29 years of age having lower seroprevalence than children <12 years of age (Prevalence ratio =0.85 [PR]; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98), suggesting that children were not refractory to infection in this setting. Interpretation: Iquitos demonstrates one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of COVID-19 worldwide. Current data shows a limited case burden in Iquitos for the past seven months and suggests that these levels are sufficient to provide significant but incomplete herd immunity.

0	Enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland: population-based seroprevalence surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic. OBJECTIVES: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time., STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON RSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods., RESULTS: The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area., CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.

0	Risk Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Hospital Workers: Results From a Screening Study in New Jersey, United States in Spring 2020. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a critical concern among healthcare workers (HCWs). Other studies have assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies in HCWs, with disparate findings regarding risk based on role and demographics., Methods: We screened 3904 employees and clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 virus positivity and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G at a major New Jersey hospital from April 28 to June 30, 2020. We assessed positive tests in relation to demographic and occupational characteristics and prior coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms using multivariable logistic regression models., Results: Thirteen participants (0.3%) tested positive for virus and 374 (9.6%) tested positive for IgG (total positive: 381 [9.8%]). Compared with participants with no patient care duties, the odds of positive testing (virus or antibodies) were higher for those with direct patient contact: below-median patient contact, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.71 and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-2.48; above-median patient contact, aOR = 1.98 and 95% CI = 1.35-2.91. The proportion of participants testing positive was highest for phlebotomists (23.9%), maintenance/housekeeping (17.3%), dining/food services (16.9%), and interpersonal/support roles (13.7%) despite lower levels of direct patient care duties. Positivity rates were lower among doctors (7.2%) and nurses (9.1%), roles with fewer underrepresented minorities. After adjusting for job role and patient care responsibilities and other factors, Black and Latinx workers had 2-fold increased odds of a positive test compared with white workers. Loss of smell, taste, and fever were associated with positive testing., Conclusions: The HCW categories at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection include support staff and underrepresented minorities with and without patient care responsibilities. Future work is needed to examine potential sources of community and nosocomial exposure among these understudied HCWs. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Association of Health Status and Smoking Behaviors with SARS-CoV-2 Positivity Rates. <h4>Background: </h4> Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or tobacco use is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. <h4>Methods: </h4> Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n= 8,214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. <h4>Result: </h4> s Compared to people with self-identified “excellent” or very good health status, those reporting “good” or “fair” health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> In a statewide, community-based population drawn for seroprevalence studies, we find that overall health status is associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. More research is needed to further understand the nature of this relationship.	included

0	COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers of a large COVID Hospital in Rome reveals strengths and limits of two different serological tests. In several hospitals worldwide, healthcare workers are currently at the forefront against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home. Between June 4 and July 3 2020, an investigation was carried out to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as gold standard. Four thousand, seven hundred seventy-seven participants were enrolled. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using venous blood test, with a significant difference between the two (p < 0.05). POC sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%). Among low-risk population, point-of-care's predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23% (negative) whereas venous blood test's were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative). In conclusion, point-of-care tests have low diagnostic accuracy, while venous blood tests seem to show an overall poor reliability.	included
0	Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience from 181 patients in New York. SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid beta-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients.

0	Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion Following Relieve of Confinement Measures. Seroprevalence studies are crucial both for estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and to provide a measure for the efficiency of the confinement measures. Portuguese universities were closed on March 16th 2020, when Portugal only registered 62 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases per million. We have validated a SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assay to a stabilized full-length spike protein using 216 pre-pandemic and 19 molecularly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive individual's samples. At NOVA University of Lisbon, presential work was partially resumed on May 25th with staggered schedules. From June 15th to 30th, 3-4 weeks after the easing of confinement measures, we screened 1,636 collaborators of NOVA university of Lisbon for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgA and IgG antibodies. We found that spike-specific IgG in 50 of 1,636 participants (3.0%), none of which had anti-spike IgA antibodies. As participants self-reported as asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, our study also provides a measurement of the prevalence of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our study suggests that essential workers have a 2-fold increase in viral exposure, when compared to non-essential workers that observed confinement. Additional serological surveys in different population subgroups will paint a broader picture of the effect of the confinement measures in the broader community.

0	A contact tracing prospective cohort retrieving epidemiological facts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aspects; a serological analysis . <h4>Introduction: </h4> Novel coronavirus spread seems mysterious enough for convincing us to double check the indices being used to predict its transmission. Serological analysis was applied for assessing some metric epidemiological aspects of the infection and its transmissibility among people who were in contact with SARA-CoV-2 patients. <h4>Methods: </h4> In this contact tracing prospective cohort study, 453 contact cases of forty COVID 19 patients were followed for three months. SARS-CoV-2 patients were diagnosed by real time polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. The history of infectiousness was detected by serological testing of IgG and IgM. Trained expert team completed two questionnaires and blood samples were taken by experts in laboratory. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Ver.21) and R software. Some important epidemiological characteristics of the infection were calculated. <h4>Result: </h4> s Mean age of SARS-CoV-2 patients and contact cases were 53.0±18.2 and 30.8±19.3 years, respectively. Overall R 0 of the infection was 2.56. Household and non-household secondary attack rates (SAR) were 20% (95%CI; 12.7 – 27.3) and 11.3% (95%CI; 6.1-16.5), respectively. Transmission probability in each contact was 0.0205 and the serial interval was 6.4±4.6 (95% CI; 5.2–7.6) days. SAR among contact cases who exposed asymptomatic primary cases (28%, 95%CI; 10-46%) was higher than that (13.8%, 95%CI;9.4-18.2) among contact cases exposing to symptomatic patients. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> We concluded a herd immunity between 60 and 65% is needed in human communities. Findings demonstrated how much reduction in infection R 0 is predicted based on both clinical and public health interventions.	included
0	Prevalence and Clinical Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Silent Carriers Among Actively Treated Patients with Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic. INTRODUCTION: In Europe, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicenter in Italy. Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers., RESULTS: In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness., CONCLUSION: Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.

0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the urban population of Qatar: An analysis of antibody testing on a sample of 112,941 individuals. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers. <h4>Methods</h4> Residual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures. <h4>Results</h4> We tested 112,941 individuals (∼10% of Qatar’s urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Fewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar’s urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.	included
0	The duration, dynamics and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in individual healthcare workers. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary., METHODS: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning., RESULTS: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

BACKGROUND: Global cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, causing havoc to several economies. So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21-30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/mul; IQR = 40.6-178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5-3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49). We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number., CONCLUSION: This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease. Health professionals should be conscious of individuals presenting with anosmia since this was seen as the strongest predictor of virus infection.	included

Lower health literacy and higher mortality rates in the homeless and vulnerable population compared with the background population potentially leaves this group or people more exposed to COVID-19. This study assessed the vulnerable population of Aarhus in relation to COVID-19 infection., METHODS: Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed., RESULTS: We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals. On the day of testing, COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, coughing and/or sore throat were found in 63 of 240 (26.3%) of the participants in April and in 26 of 123 (21.1%) in June. In the April testing round, 175 of 291 (59.9%) reported to be born in Denmark. The corresponding number for the June testing round was 84 of 138 (60.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite their vulnerable profile, the vulnerable citizens tested in Aarhus were not infected with COVID-19 at the testing day and very few participants carried antibodies., FUNDING: Testing was funded by Aarhus University Hospital., TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.

0	The Sheba Medical Center healthcare workers' children's school: can we open schools safely?. OBJECTIVE: The role of school closure in mitigating COVID-19 transmission has been questioned. In our medical center, during a 9-week national lockdown, an alternative school was opened for healthcare workers' (HCW) children with a small number of children per class and strict symptom surveillance. After lockdown was lifted we screened children and their parents for SARS-CoV2 serology., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCW parents and their children after one teacher contracted COVID-19 following exposure at home and 53 children were exposed, isolated and tested by RT-PCR. We compared families with children attending the alternative school to families with children who remained at home during the 9-week lockdown. Epidemiologic and medical data were collected via a short questionnaire; naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and blood was collected for SARS-CoV2 IgA and IgG titres., RESULTS: A total of 435 children attended the Sheba alternative school. Among the 53 children exposed to the infected teacher, none tested positive by RT-PCR. Of these, 18 children-parent pairs were tested for serology and all were negative. A total of 106/435 (24%) children and their 78 parents were recruited for the cross-sectional study; 70 attended the Sheba school and 36 did not. Approximately 16% of children in either group reported symptoms (11/70 in the school group and 6/36 in the 'stay home' group), yet SARS-CoV2 was not detected by PCR in any, and previous exposure, as determined by serological tests, was low and not significantly different between the groups., CONCLUSION: In an alternative school for HCW's children, active during COVID-19 national outbreak, we found no evidence of increased infection compared with children that stayed home.

BACKGROUND AND GOALS: The aim of the study is to know the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and professional staff of a medium or long-stay hospital during the peak period of the pandemic in Spain, spring 2020., MATERIAL AND METHODS: At the end of February 2020, we developed at the hospital a strategy to diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infection consisting of complementing the realization of PCR tests at real time with a quick technique of lateral flow immunochromatography to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the virus. We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020., RESULTS: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689)., CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's. Combining PCR tests (gold standard) with antibodies tests proved useful as a diagnostic strategy. Copyright © 2020 SEGG. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.	included

0	Population-based seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the herd immunity threshold in Maranhao. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Maranhao, Brazil., METHODS: A population-based household survey was performed, from July 27, 2020 to August 8, 2020. The estimates considered clustering, stratification and non-response. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys R Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas R e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics)., RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2., CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey is one of the highest reported. The local herd immunity threshold may have been reached or might be reached soon.	included
0	Serologic testing of U.S. blood donations to identify SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies: December 2019-January 2020. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, with subsequent worldwide spread. The first U.S. cases were identified in January 2020., METHODS: To determine if SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies were present in sera prior to the first identified case in the U.S. on January 19, 2020, residual archived samples from 7,389 routine blood donations collected by the American Red Cross from December 13, 2019 to January 17, 2020, from donors resident in nine states (California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) were tested at CDC for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Specimens reactive by pan-immunoglobulin (pan Ig) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the full spike protein were tested by IgG and IgM ELISAs, microneutralization test, Ortho total Ig S1 ELISA, and receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity assay., RESULTS: Of the 7,389 samples, 106 were reactive by pan Ig. Of these 106 specimens, 90 were available for further testing. Eighty four of 90 had neutralizing activity, 1 had S1 binding activity, and 1 had receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity >50%, suggesting the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies. Donations with reactivity occurred in all nine states., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced into the United States prior to January 19, 2020.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a high-risk category during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis, with frontline HCWs at emergency departments (EDs) may be at an even higher risk. Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt., METHODS: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data., RESULTS: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR. This illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs regardless of symptoms, and the need for strict measures in securing HCWs to reduce transmission from healthcare facilities to the community during the current pandemic.

0	Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-specific Antibodies in German Blood Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. METHOD(S): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULT(S): Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide. CONCLUSION(S): These findings confirm the efficacy serological testing in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.	included

0	A COVID-19 Hotspot Area: Activities and Epidemiological Findings. By late March 2020, Villa Caldari, a small village of the municipality of Ortona (Abruzzo region), was registering an incidence rate of COVID-19 cases ten times greater than the overall municipality and was declared a hotspot area. Twenty-two days later, epidemiological investigation and sampling were performed, to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 circulation and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Overall, 681 nasopharyngeal swabs and 667 blood samples were collected. Only one resident of the village resulted in being positive for RNA viral shedding, while 73 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall seroprevalence was 10.9%. The difference between the seroprevalence of infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was significant (chi2 = 14.50 p-value = 0.0001). Amongst the residents positive for antibodies, fatigue and/or muscle pain, fever and anosmia were the most experienced symptoms, whose most frequent onset was observed during the first two weeks of March. Familial and habit-related clusters were highlighted. Nevertheless, the investigations showed a low SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the village at the time of the sampling, demonstrating virus transmission could be limited when strict emergency measures are followed. Given the favorable results, the emergency measures were then lifted.	included

OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence studies to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population and subgroups are key for evaluating mitigation and vaccination policies and for understanding the spread of the disease both on the national level and for comparison with the international community., METHODS: Corona Immunitas is a research program of coordinated, population-based, seroprevalence studies implemented by Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+). Over 28,340 participants, randomly selected and age-stratified, with some regional specificities will be included. Additional studies in vulnerable and highly exposed subpopulations are also planned. The studies will assess population immunological status during the pandemic., RESULTS: Phase one (first wave of pandemic) estimates from Geneva showed a steady increase in seroprevalence up to 10.8% (95% CI 8.2-13.9, n = 775) by May 9, 2020. Since June, Zurich, Lausanne, Basel City/Land, Ticino, and Fribourg recruited a total of 5973 participants for phase two thus far., CONCLUSIONS: Corona Immunitas will generate reliable, comparable, and high-quality serological and epidemiological data with extensive coverage of Switzerland and of several subpopulations, informing health policies and decision making in both economic and societal sectors.

BACKGROUND: A population-based study to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy outcomes., METHODS: Prospective, population-based study including pregnant women consecutively attended at first/second trimester or at delivery at three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM/IgA) were measured in all participants and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was performed at delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative women: miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small-for-gestational age, neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome plus abnormal fetal growth, malformation, intrapartum fetal distress. Outcomes were also compared between positive symptomatic and positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 women., RESULTS: Of 2,225 pregnant women, 317 (14.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=314, 99.1%) and/or RT-PCR (n=36, 11.4%). Among positive women, 217 (68.5%) were asymptomatic, 93 (29.3%) had mild COVID-19 and 7 (2.2%) pneumonia, of which 3 required intensive care unit admission. In women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, the primary outcome occurred in 43 (13.6%) and 268 (14%), respectively [risk difference -0.4%, (95% CI: -4.1% to 4.1)]. As compared with non-infected women, women with symptomatic COVID-19 had increased rates of preterm delivery (7.2% vs. 16.9%, p=0.003) and intrapartum fetal distress (9.1% vs. 19.2%, p=0.004), while asymptomatic women had similar rates to non-infected cases. Among 143 fetuses from infected mothers, none had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA in cord blood., CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of pregnancy complications in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to non-infected women. However, symptomatic COVID-19 was associated with modest increases in preterm delivery and intrapartum fetal distress. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

0	Serology in COVID: Light the Lantern and Pave the Way to Unexplored... International Guidelines have voted for PCR as the Gold Standard in COVID diagnosis. Nasoparyngeal swab is the preferred specimen for PCR. It has a high probability of diagnosing early infection. But the diagnostic sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR decreases with increase in lapse between the infection and presentation to hospital. This might lead to dire consequences of labelling these patients as false negative, though such patients have been proved to be potentially infective since viral shedding occurs through other body fluids (stools) for long. COVID infection reveals that the IgM antibodies start to appear as early as 5th day of infection and switches over to IgA within 2-3 days. The aim of the study was to see if COVID antibody testing be coupled with PCR for diagnosis especially in patients presenting late (more than 14 days) of onset of infection? And if the antibodies are giving values, hence can them be reported quantitatively rather than in qualitative fashion? The second objective was to see if the COVID antibody levels be used to monitor the disease severity? And if the antibody levels of SARS CoV 2 be used an indicator to monitor the recovery?Copyright © 2021, Association of Clinical Biochemists of India.	included
0	Sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in a high-prevalence setting. Evaluation and power of seroprevalence studies depend on the performed serological assays. The aim of this study was to assess four commercial serological tests from EUROIMMUN, DiaSorin, Abbott, and Roche as well as an in-house immunofluorescence and neutralization test for their capability to identify SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals in a high-prevalence setting. Therefore, 42 social and working contacts of a German super-spreader were tested. Consistent with a high-prevalence setting, 26 of 42 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive by neutralization test (NT), and immunofluorescence test (IFT) confirmed 23 of these 26 positive test results (NT 61.9% and IFT 54.8% seroprevalence). Four commercial assays detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 33.3-40.5% individuals. Besides an overall discrepancy between the NT and the commercial assays regarding their sensitivity, this study revealed that commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike-based assays are better to predict the neutralization titer than nucleoprotein-based assays are.	included

Objective: To analyze the incidence of Covid-19 in patients who are chronic users of hydroxychloroquine., Patients and methods: Cross-sectional retrospective observational multicenter study in health areas and districts from Castilla La-Mancha and Andalucia. Of the 4451 participants included in the first recruitment, 3817 with valid data were selected. The main variable of the study is the presence or absence of Covid-19 infection by clinical, serological or polymerase chain reaction diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical variables and treatment and concomitant comorbidities were recorded., Results: 169 (4,45%) patients had Covid-19 infection, of which 12 (7.1 %) died and 32 (18.9%) required hospital admission. Previous respiratory pathology was related to Covid-19 infection (P<.05). Maculopathy appears in 5.3% of patients and is significantly related to the dose of hydroxychloroquine consumed (P<.05)., Conclusion: There is no relationship between chronic use of hydroxychloroquine and the incidence of Covid-19.

Result(s): 569 NMOSD/MOGAD patients from 40 Italian MS Centres have been censored for COVID-19. 68% (387/569) of the patients were treated with rituximab, 16% (91/569) with azathioprine, 4.4% (25/569) with tocilizumab, 5.4% (31/569) with other therapies and 6.2% (35/569) were untreated or without information. 8/569 patients (1.4%) were diagnosed having confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19: positive rhino-pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were found in 4 out of 6 tested patients. At the time of data collection, 6 patients recovered, 1 was still hospitalised and, unfortunately, 1 died. Hospitalisation was required for 3 patients. 5/8 (68%) patients were treated with rituximab. There was no evidence of any difference of such a percentage with the one of the overall population (OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.18-3.31, p=0.74). COVID-19 infection was classified mild in 5, severe in 2 and critical in 1. The main experienced symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. 5/8 patients experienced CNS symptoms as headache (3), dizziness (1), anosmia (1) and delirium (1). Conclusion(s): 1) the prevalence of COVID-19 infection appears low in NMOSD/MOGAD patients (1.9%) with a mortality rate similar to that of the general italian population (12.5% vs 14.3%); 2) no other risk factors for severe course of COVID-19 than those already known emerge; 3) the baseline use of biologics, and in particular anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and apparently not with worse COVID-19 outcomes Even if preliminary, these findings suggest a cautious optimism in the care of these autoimmune conditions during the pandemic phase.	included
0	Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Rehabilitation Facility: Evolution of the Presence of Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 and Serological Antibody Responses. At the start of the UK coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, this rare point prevalence study revealed that one-third of patients (15 of 45) in a London inpatient rehabilitation unit were found to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but asymptomatic. We report on 8 patients in detail, including their clinical stability, the evolution of their nasopharyngeal viral reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) burden, and their antibody levels over time, revealing the infection dynamics by RT-PCR and serology during the acute phase. Notably, a novel serological test for antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 showed that 100% of our asymptomatic cohort remained seropositive 3-6 weeks after diagnosis.

0	Non-Congruent SARS-CoV-2 Waves in England. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Examination of the chronology, location and size of waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection across England could shed light on the inter-play between the 1 st and the 2 nd Waves. From mid-October onwards such an analysis becomes increasingly difficult due to the emergence of a new strain (VOC-202012/01) and in light of the differential implementation of lockdown measures and tiers. Therefore, we sought to examine trends and correlations in virus prevalence and covid-related deaths spanning the start of the UK pandemic in March 2020 through to early November 2020 – i.e., including the first growth period of the 2 nd Wave. We found striking regional relationships between the 1 st and the 2 nd Wave that are difficult to explain other than by involving some role for changing levels of immunity in the population affecting the progression of the pandemic.	included
0	Clinical Features of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hemodialysis Patients. BACKGROUND: CKD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized., OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients., METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed., RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common in hemodialysis patients, especially among patients with initial negative PCR that later seroconvert. Thus COVID-19 mortality in hemodialysis patients may be lower than previously estimated based on PCR tests alone. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.	included
0	Seroconversion in patients with cancer and oncology health care workers infected by SARS-CoV-2. Background: Patients with cancer have high risk for severe complications and poor outcome to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) within 3 weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19. Patients and methods: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled (i) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; (ii) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and (iii) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology health care professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. Results: From 30 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. Overall, 86 subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, and 60 (36.2%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19. Median time from symptom onset (for cases not confirmed by RT-PCR) or RT-PCR confirmation to serum antibody test was 17 days (interquartile range 26). In the population with confirmed RT-PCR, 83.8% of cases were IgG positive. No difference in IgG positivity was observed between cancer patients and health workers (87.9% versus 80.5%; P = 0.39). Conclusions: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody detection do not differ between cancer patients and healthy subjects.	included

0	Low prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among voluntary blood donors in Guangzhou, China. Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	included
0	High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control. <h4>Background: </h4> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy. Methods. We compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior PCR test reporting from members of more than 9000 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population. Results. We estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.38% (95% CI 0.30% - 0.48%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 35% (26% - 47%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 15% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.40 (0.32 - 0.51) to avoid continued growth of the Utah epidemic. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.	included
0	Research on pregnant women suspected of having COVID-19 in the epidemic outbreak area. <h4>Background: </h4> COVID-19 has become a major public health problem around the world. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. The purpose of this study is to investigate and analysis the clinical features, imaging findings, related laboratory indicators, treatments and outcomes of maternal-fetal for cases of suspected infection COVID-19 pregnant women in outbreak area in order to provide reference for clinical work. Methods A case-control study was conducted to compare clinical features, treatment, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results One confirmed patient who was discharged from hospital after a negative RT-PCR result, was readmitted and subsequently tested positive on RT-PCR. The vaginal delivery rate and gestational week of confirmed case group showed significantly lower than 2019 control group. Pulmonary CT images were initially same between confirmed group and suspected group, but changed over time with different trends. The two case groups shared similar dynamic profiles on blood routine test. Four confirmed cases which had COVID-19 antibody test were all positive for IgG antibody and negative for IgM antibody, via both umbilical cord blood and the newborns. Fifteen of newborns (three confirmed and twelve suspected cases) at nearly three months old were tested negative by antibodies. Conclusions Pulmonary CT images showed different trends with the extending of time between confirmed group and suspected group. Blood test results weren’t strong enough to make differential diagnosis between two case groups. Perform antibody test can understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection. Infant obtain COVID-19 IgG antibody from maternal that only may last for less than three months.	included
0	Validation of COVID-19 serologic tests and large scale screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers. Objectives: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and Methods: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. Result(s): Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. Conclusion(s): Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence. The use of an indeterminate result from parallel orthogonal testing allows for the follow-up and re-testing, which helps resolve discrepancies between assays.Copyright © 2021 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists	included
0	Do COVID-19 Antibodies Provide Long-Term Protection?. Introduction: Post severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, an immune response is generated among healthy, immunocompetent individuals with immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) antibodies. IgM rises earlier than IgG, indicating a recent infection. However, a detailed analysis is required to assess long-term immune reactions induced by antibodies. Method and Materials: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from June 2020 to October 2020 where serum samples were collected from patients. The samples were obtained by phlebotomy for antibody testing. All the reactive patients were followed up after 60 days of initial testing. Results: A total of 728 patients participated in the study, of which 79 (10.8%) were seropositive at baseline. Seventy-two (91.1%) participants came back for follow-up after 60 days (two months) and were included in the final analysis. Among the 72 participants, 35 (48.6%) exhibited symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and 37 (51.4%) were asymptomatic. After 60 days, 37 (including 20 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic) participants were still seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Mean change in percentage from seropositive to seronegative was more in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic patients (54.0% vs. 42.8%). Conclusion: In this study, humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is not long-lasting among individuals with mild signs and symptoms. Care should be taken while implicating that antibodies can provide long term protection against SARS-CoV-2. Further large-scale studies are needed.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among health care workers in a New York City hospital: A cross-sectional analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

0	The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia. Background: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2., Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia., Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%-21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O)., Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	included
0	"COVID-19 prevalence among health-care workers of Gastroenterology department: An audit from a tertiary-care hospital in India. Background and Aim: In the present coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) era, health-care workers (HCWs) warrant special attention because of their higher risk and potential to transmit the disease. Gastroenterology services include emergency and critical care along with the endoscopy procedures, which have aerosol-generating potential. This study was aimed at auditing the COVID-19 impact on HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department of our hospital., Methods: The COVID-19 status of 117 HCWs was collected using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroassay. COVID-19 positivity was correlated with demographic characteristics, job profile, area of work, and medical history., Results: Thirty-eight HCWs (32.48%) showed evidence of COVID-19 using PCR (23.93%) or only IgG assay (8.55%). Endoscopy technicians (68.75%) exhibited significantly higher (P = 0.003) COVID-19 incidence compared to doctors (20.69%). Those working in the critical care units exhibited a trend toward higher COVID-19 incidence (42.86%). None of the six HCWs who received adequate hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis developed evidence of COVID-19. All the HCWs with COVID-19 disease recovered. However, there was a considerable loss of ""man-days."", Conclusions: In our setting, we observed a high COVID-19 risk for HCWs working in the Gastroenterology department, with the highest risk among the endoscopy technicians. A more stringent triaging and pretesting of patients, as well as HCWs, might decrease the risk of COVID-19. Further multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the risk and related parameters.

0	Seroprevalence of Specific Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from Hotspot Communities in the Dominican Republic. Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance to assess the proportion of a population that has developed antibodies against a newly introduced virus and could therefore potentially exhibit immunologic protection against subsequent infection. This study aims to understand the distribution of IgM and IgG antibodies in the Dominican Republic. We surveyed a total of 12,897 participants between April and June 2020 in 10 provinces of the Dominican Republic. Survey efforts in emerging hotspots yielded a positivity for all participants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM of 3.8% and IgG of 5.4%, indicating that the pathogen was in circulation before the identification of those particular communities as hotspots. We found important age differences between participants who participated in the serological study where a higher mean age is associated IgM positivity and a lower age with IgG positivity. Our results highlight the need for strategies that involve community-based seroprevalence monitoring. These should preclude syndromic case identification. Also, the higher mean age of IgM-positive participants suggests that strategies based on syndromic surveillance could identify hotspots at later phases, based on the number of cases detected at the healthcare center, as such community-based seroprevalence monitoring may be an effective intervention for future outbreaks.	included
0	Prevalence of current and past SARS-CoV-2 infections among police employees in Poland, june-july 2020. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to determine the prevalence of current and past SARS-CoV-2 infections among police employees. Method(s): This cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 5082 police employees from Mazowieckie Province, Poland. RT-PCR testing for current SARS-CoV-2 infection and serological tests (ELISA) for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA and IgG antibodies were performed. Result(s): All RT-PCR tests were negative. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA index was positive (>8) in 8.9% of participants, including 11.2% women and 7.7% men (p < 0.001). Equivocal IgM+IgA index (6-8) was found in 9.8% of participants, including 11.9% women and 8.7% men (p < 0.001). The IgG index was positive (>6) in 4.3% and equivocal (4-6) in 13.2% of participants. A higher odds of positive IgM+IgA index was found in women vs. men (OR: 1.742) and police officers vs. civilian employees (OR: 1.411). Participants aged >=60 years had a higher odds of positive IgG index vs. those aged 20-29 years (OR: 3.309). Daily vaping also increased the odds of positive IgG index (OR: 2.058). Conclusion(s): The majority of Polish police employees are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaping and older age (>=60 years) were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	included

0	Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center. BACKGROUND: The burden of COVID-19 is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULT(S): We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (CI 95%: 0.3-2.4%). Two patients were positive by NP swab RT-PCR, but only one seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or solid organ transplant were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared to other groups. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and two patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Universal COVID-19 screening of 4040 health care workers in a resource-limited setting: an Egyptian pilot model in a university with 12 public hospitals and medical centers. BACKGROUND: The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs), particularly in resource-limited settings, remains unclear. To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt., METHODS: Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests., RESULTS: Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n = 54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever >=38degreeC and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n = 116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0)., CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibodies at Delivery in Women, Partners, and Newborns. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in parturient women, their partners, and their newborns and the association of such antibodies with obstetric and neonatal outcomes., METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available., RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies., CONCLUSION: We found no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric or neonatal complications. Sixty-seven percent of newborns delivered by mothers with antibodies had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A limitation of our study is that we lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful differences between those with and without evidence of infection.	included
0	Chembio DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG Serological Testing: Laboratory Validation, Guidelines, and Recommendations. BACKGROUND: On January 30, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In this article we describe our experience at Richmond University Medical Center with Chembio serological IgM, IgG testing., METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of patients and hospital employees, we utilized Chembio COVID-19 IgM/IgG serological testing in addition to Cepheid RT-PCR analysis., RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of Chembio serological test for IgM and IgG as an employee screening tool in a community hospital setting. The total number of currently asymptomatic employees screened was 1,866 from the Richmond University Medical Center. The non-exposed group included 1,253 (67.1%) employees with no significant clinical history and non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies. The convalescent group included 255 (13.7%) of the employees with elevation of IgG only, 18 (1%) employees with past history of positive PCR and COVID-19 who currently have non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies or demonstrate elevated IgG only, followed by 3 employees (< 1%) with no past clinical history who demonstrated reactive IgM and IgG antibodies and negative follow up by PCR. The reported 14.9% exposure/convalescent rate is lower than the reported 20% by the Department of Health and Governor Andrew Cuomo and may represent a better utilization of personal protective equipment, better hand washing techniques, and better disinfection procedures combined with strict social distancing., CONCLUSIONS: Chembio's performance is satisfactory; however, hospitals must design their own policies addressing: who needs to be screened and who will interpret the results as well as constructing management algorithms for employees with no previous history and current double positive antibodies.	included
0	Prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-specific antibodies in german blood donors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. Method(s): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in southwestern Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. Result(s): Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide. Conclusion(s): These findings confirm the efficacy serological testing in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.©Copyright	included
0	Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biological therapy. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A similar course of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and in the general population has been reported. However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy., METHODS: 354 sera from IBD patients under biological therapy recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were i) age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii) healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii) IBD patients under biological therapy collected in the pre-COVID era., RESULTS: 8 out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody (prevalence 2.3%). IgG positive patients' percentage recruited from Milan was significantly higher than those recruited from other locations (prevalence 5.4% vs. 0.4% p < 0.005). IgG positive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever, anosmia and ageusia, and were more likely to have entered in close contact with COVID-19 positive subjects before the study enrolment., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biological therapy reflects values measured in the local general population. Specific symptoms and contact history with SARS-CoV2-infected individuals strongly increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 seropositivity. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in the setting of a non-dedicated COVID-19 hospital in a low CoV-2 incidence area: Implications for surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in the setting of a non-dedicated COVID-19 hospital in a low CoV-2 incidence area. We analysed the data of the patients admitted at our surgical department during the period 31st March - June 30, 2020. Among 86 patients included in the study, we found 2 (2.3%) patients positive for both SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG, 2 (2.3%) for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and 1 for only SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. Thus, seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8%; nasopharyngeal swab was negative in all the cases. Considering the current limitations in sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab, the uncertainty in the natural history of SARS-CoV2, and the reported prevalence of CoV-2, we think that careful preadmission triage and tests, the use of personal protective equipment and safe management of surgical smoke are mandatory also in our context of low CoV-2 incidence area.

0	Prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 according to socioeconomic and ethnic status in a nationwide Brazilian survey. Objectives: To investigate socioeconomic and ethnic group inequalities in prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the 27 federative units of Brazil., Methods: In this cross-sectional study, three household surveys were carried out on May 14-21, June 4-7, and June 21-24, 2020 in 133 Brazilian urban areas. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 250 individuals in each city to undergo a rapid antibody test. Subjects answered a questionnaire on household assets, schooling and self-reported skin color/ethnicity using the standard Brazilian classification in five categories: white, black, brown, Asian or indigenous. Principal component analyses of assets was used to classify socioeconomic position into five wealth quintiles. Poisson regression was used for the analyses., Results: 25 025 subjects were tested in the first, 31 165 in the second, and 33 207 in the third wave of the survey, with prevalence of positive results equal to 1.4%, 2.4%, and 2.9% respectively. Individuals in the poorest quintile were 2.16 times (95% confidence interval 1.86; 2.51) more likely to test positive than those in the wealthiest quintile, and those with 12 or more years of schooling had lower prevalence than subjects with less education. Indigenous individuals had 4.71 (3.65; 6.08) times higher prevalence than whites, as did those with black or brown skin color. Adjustment for region of the country reduced the prevalence ratios according to wealth, education and ethnicity, but results remained statistically significant., Conclusions: The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil shows steep class and ethnic gradients, with lowest risks among white, educated and wealthy individuals.	included

We present the operating system that the Hemato-Oncology Department of the Santobono-Pausilipon Hospital applied. We divided our department in three zones: surveillance and screening; quarantine and COVID free, in order to screen admitted patients and to reduce the risk of cross infection. From 3 April until 29 May 2020 (56 days), 662 patients and caregivers underwent rapid serological tests for a total of 1397 assays. No patient or parent with SARS-CoV2 infection was found, demonstrating the effectiveness of COVID-19 screening process. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR SARS-COV-2 SEROPOSITIVITY WITHIN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE. Objective: Making decisions about how to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without completely disrupting our activity requires better tools that inform the extent of transmission. Understanding risk factors of virus susceptibility could help us to establish intervention policies. The objective of our work is to assess risk factors and seroprevalence in our patients in order to plan evidence-based strategies. Design(s): Multicenter retrospective, anonymized cohort analysis performed in 11 private clinics belonging to the IVIRMA group in Spain. Material(s) and Method(s): Between April 27th and June 26th, 2020, 6140 individuals undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Before tested, a symptomatic triage had been carried out and only patients classified with a negative triage attended the clinic for further testing. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We divided our clinics into two different geographic areas: region A (seroprevalence <5%) and region B (seroprevalence >5%) based on the results obtained in our population. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Result(s): Of the 6140 persons tested for SARS-CoV-2, 4470 (72.8%) were women and 1670 (27.2%) men. Over the course of the study, 42 (0.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Seropositivity does not vary significantly with age and we did not observe differences regarding gender or blood group. However, we found that individuals with negative rhesus (Rh) factor had a slightly greater risk of being seropositive (RR 2.5 [129-2.13]) than those Rh positive. There are no differences in the percentage of people in the active phase of the disease depending on the geographical area (RR 0.8 [0.43-1.52]). However, when we analysed the data according to time, the rate of positive individuals does not vary throughout the weeks in region A, while for the region B the incidence of IgM drops significantly (p=0.003) from the first week of the study (3.7%) to the last (0.0%), which would indicate decline of the virus transmission over time. When we analysed the seropositivity rate according the partner's serological status, the data showed that there is approximately 10 times more incidence of being positive IgG in couples than in random population. Conclusion(s): We show that in areas with higher prevalence of the disease, the percentage of IgM positive individuals is also higher. Also, there is a greater risk of being infected when the couple is already seropositive. No differences were observed according the age and there is higher prevalence in Rh-negative individuals.Copyright © 2020	included

Serological tests are critically important for determining SARS-CoV-2 exposures within both individuals and populations. We validated a SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain serological test using 834 pre-pandemic samples and 31 samples from COVID-19-recovered donors. We then completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing of 1293 parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from 4 April to 3 June 2020. We found 80 of 1293 (6.2%) of parturient women had immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgM SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race/ethnicity differences in seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can potentially be used to estimate exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within the community.Copyright © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Exposure of hospital healthcare workers to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of infection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can also amplify outbreaks within healthcare facilities if they become ill. Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	Assesment of SARS-CoV-2 infection-in dentists and supporting staff at a university dental hospital in Argentina. Introduction: Oral healthcare professionals are at increased risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of workers who provided services during the COVID-19 pandemic at a dental care and educational institution in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area., Materials and methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study including 358 workers who provided essential services during the first 180 days of the COVID-19 pandemic at the Dental Hospital at Buenos Aires University School of Dentistry (FOUBA). Following epidemiological data, these workers underwent diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (1- nasal or throat swab tests; 2- blood test for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISA]; 3- commercial rapid serology test)., Results: Three diagnostic tests were implemented. Rapid tests were performed on 290 subjects, with 255 negative results (88%; CI95: 84%-91%) and 35 positive (12%; CI95: 9%-16%); ELISA on 317 subjects, with 308 negative (97%; CI95: 95%-98%) and 9 positive (3%; CI95: 2%-5%); and PCR on 204 subjects, with 196 negative (96%; CI95: 92%-98%) and 8 positive (4%; CI95: 2%-8%). There were 358 subjects who were evaluated by ELISA or PCR, with 342 negative results (96%; CI95: 93%-97%) and 16 positives (4%; CI95: 3%-7%)., Conclusion: For this sample of dentists, dental assistants and nonclinical personnel, the weighted prevalence of COVID-19 was 4%. Similar studies should be conducted at other dental care facilities in order to evaluate the worldwide impact of COVID-19 on the dental care community.

0	Exploratory drilling: how to set up, carry out, and evaluate a seroprevalence study. Seroprevalence studies represent a very important tool to find out what fraction of population has already met with the new type of coronavirus (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Without these data, it is almost impossible for the state authorities to manage the epidemic and adopt rational measures. This article brings the results of a medium-sized seroprevalence study which was carried out in the spring of 2020 in South Bohemia. In the Strakonice and Pisek regions, the ELISA method was used to test the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies in 2011 subjects, volunteers from general public and selected professions working in areas with a higher exposure to the infection. The study showed that already in May 2020, 2.9% of inhabitants of the Strakonice region and 1.9% of inhabitants of the Pisek region had antibodies against the coronavirus. These numbers imply that for each PCR positive person, there were at least fifty others who had probably already undergone the infection. The article points out three types of problems that might occur in such a study. First, the study must be planned correctly, and possible outcomes must be pre-assessed. Second, an appropriate test must be selected with known parameters. This enables us to correctly estimate the share of false positive and false negative results. Third, the data must be evaluated in a reasonable way and correct inference must be performed. We offer a set of recommendations how to manage these issues and how to solve problems that inevitably arise in such a large-scale testing.	included

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Hintergrund: Der indikationsgesteuert durchgefuhrte direkte Virusnachweis (RT-PCR im Abstrich) unterschatzt wegen der moglichen asymptomatischen Verlaufe die Zahl der SARS-CoV-2-Infizierten erheblich. Daher sind populationsbasierte Erhebungen der Antikorperpravalenz zur verlasslichen Einschatzung der gegenwartigen Pandemie unverzichtbar. Methoden: In einem Klinikum der Maximalversorgung wurden 74,8 % aller Mitarbeiter/innen mit direktem Patientenkontakt (n = 1480) sowie als nicht medizinprofessionelle Kontrollgruppe Mitarbeiter/innen lokaler Supermarkte mit direktem Kundenkontakt (n = 300) auf Antikorper der Klassen IgA und IgG gegen SARS-CoV-2 getestet. Die Gesamtkohorte stellt zugleich 1,5 % der Bevolkerung der Stadtregion Fulda mit 125 000 Einwohnern dar. Ergebnisse: 1,0 % der Testpersonen waren positiv fur IgG, 4,4 % fur IgA. Bei einer Testspezifitat von 99,6 % (IgG) bzw. 92,4 % (IgA) liegt weder im Gesamttestkollektiv noch in einer der Untergruppen eine klinisch signifikante Immunitat gegen SARS-CoV-2 vor. Schlussfolgerung: Von einer relevanten Anzahl durchlaufener unerkannter Infektionen kann in dieser Region nicht ausgegangen werden. Die noch sparlichen Daten aus internationalen Regionen lassen Immunitatsraten bis maximal 60 % in stark exponierten Kollektiven vermuten, wobei sich in Deutschland ein dynamisches Mosaik mit aktuellen Werten zwischen null und 15 % abzeichnet. Diese Heterogenitat legt eine regionale Planung der Mabetanahmen zur Kontrolle der Virusausbreitung nahe. Ein relevanter immunologischer Schutz der Bevolkerung vor SARS- CoV-2 ist bis zur Verfugbarkeit einer Impfung nicht zu erwarten.Copyright © 2020 MVS Medizinverlage Stuttgart.

0	Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 would be greatly facilitated by the identification of immunological correlates of protection in humans. However, to date, studies on protective immunity have only been performed in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002).Copyright © 2020 Addetia et al.	included

0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and asymptomatic viral carriage in healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of asymptomatic viral carriage and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULT(S): The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, chi2=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95%CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Community seroprevalence of COVID-19 in probable and possible cases at primary health care centres in Spain. BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of information about patients with mild or moderate symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is especially true for those who attended and were followed up at primary care settings. OBJECTIVE(S): We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of possible cases and among probable cases followed in primary care. METHOD(S): We selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups from a total population of 19 899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona. We also invited all the patients that had been followed by General Practitioners (GPs). For both populations, we used COVID-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassays, which qualitatively assess the presence of patient-generated Immunoglobulins G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). RESULT(S): Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample participated in the study. The mean age was 43.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 21.79] and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.47% (95% confidence interval = 3.44-8.58). Six hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed up by GPs. The mean age was 46.97 years (SD = 20.05) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among possible cases was lower than expected. Approximately, 40% of the symptomatic patients followed up by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic were positive.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and neutralizing activity in donor and patient blood. Given the limited availability of serological testing to date, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in different populations has remained unclear. Here, we report very low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in two San Francisco Bay Area populations. Seroreactivity was 0.26% in 387 hospitalized patients admitted for non-respiratory indications and 0.1% in 1,000 blood donors in early April 2020. We additionally describe the longitudinal dynamics of immunoglobulin-G (IgG), immunoglobulin-M (IgM), and in vitro neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients. The median time to seroconversion ranged from 10.3-11.0 days for these 3 assays. Neutralizing antibodies rose in tandem with immunoglobulin titers following symptom onset, and positive percent agreement between detection of IgG and neutralizing titers was >93%. These findings emphasize the importance of using highly accurate tests for surveillance studies in low-prevalence populations, and provide evidence that seroreactivity using SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG and anti-spike IgM assays are generally predictive of in vitro neutralizing capacity.	included
0	Prevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Italian Adults and Associated Risk Factors. We aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with anti- severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in a large population of adult volunteers from five administrative departments of the Liguria and Lombardia regions. A total of 3609 individuals were included in this analysis. Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) class antibodies] at three private laboratories (Istituto Diganostico Varelli, Medical Center, and Casa della Salute di Genova). Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0% [398/3609; confidence interval (CI) 10.0%-12.1%]. Seroprevalence was higher in female inmates than in male inmates (12.5% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), with the highest rate observed among adults aged >55 years (13.2%). A generalized estimating equations model showed that the main risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were the following: an occupational exposure to the virus [Odd ratio (OR) = 2.36; 95% CI 1.59-3.50, p = 0.001], being a long-term care facility resident (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 3.19-6.45, p = 0.001), and reporting previous symptoms of influenza-like illness (OR = 4.86; 95% CI 3.75-6.30, p = 0.001) or loss of sense of smell or taste (OR = 41.00; 95% CI 18.94-88.71, p = 0.001). In conclusion, we found a high prevalence (11.0%) of SARS-CoV-2 infection that is significantly associated with residing in long-term care facilities or occupational exposure to the virus. These findings warrant further investigation into SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among the Italian population.	included

Due to early implementation of public health measures, Greece had low number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 severe incidents in hospitalized patients. The National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NuKappaUA), especially its health-care/medical personnel, has been actively involved in the first line of state responses to COVID-19. To estimate the prevalence of antibodies (Igs) against SARS-CoV-2 among NKUA members, we designed a five consecutive monthly serosurvey among randomly selected NKUA consenting volunteers. Here, we present the results from the first 2500 plasma samples collected during June-July 2020. Twenty-five donors were tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs; thus, the overall seroprevalence was 1.00%. The weighted overall seroprevalence was 0.93% (95% CI: 0.27, 2.09) and varied between males [1.05% (95% CI: 0.18, 2.92)] and females [0.84% (95% CI: 0.13, 2.49)], age-groups and different categories (higher in participants from the School of Health Sciences and in scientific affiliates/faculty members/laboratory assistants), but no statistical differences were detected. Although focused on the specific population of NKUA members, our study shows that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs for the period June-July 2020 remained low and provides knowledge of public health importance for the NKUA members. Given that approximately one in three infections was asymptomatic, continuous monitoring of the progression of the pandemic by assessing Ig seroprevalence is needed.	included
0	Most chilblains observed during the COVID-19 outbreak occur in patients who are negative for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction and serology testing. Background Acral lesions, mainly chilblains, are the most frequently reported cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. In more than 80% of patients tested, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed. Methods A national survey was launched on 30 March 2020 by the French Society of Dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations. Results We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations [58.5% women, median age 25.7 years (range 18-39)]. The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains. Overall, 12 patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Of the 150 (48%) patients who were tested, 10 patients were positive. Seven of 121 (6%) RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and five of 75 (7%) serology-tested patients had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. Tested/untested patients or those with/without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral lesion clinical characteristics. Conclusions The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains, but we found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France.	included
0	Strategic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serology Testing in a Low Prevalence Setting: The COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study in Healthcare Professionals. Background Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6,p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.	included
0	Period Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an Unselected Sample of Pregnant Women in Jena, Thuringia. Introduction Following an exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections, the city of Jena, Thuringia, was the first in Germany to introduce mandatory mouth and nose coverings. An estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was achieved by screening an unselected cohort of pregnant women. Of interest was the number of unreported cases. Methods Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer's exact test. Results From 6 April to 13 May 2020, 234 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics. A total of 225 (96.2 %) SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were carried out and all remained negative. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6 %) of 180 (76.9 %) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95 % confidence interval between 0-1.7 %. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0-3.8 %, which does not differ from the 0-4.8 % for 76 households without children (p = 1.00). Discussion This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany. Antibody testing showed no evidence of the feared high number of unreported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. The seroconversion rate was below 1 % (0.6 %).	included
0	Prevention of COVID-19 infection in a pediatric oncology ward in Wuhan. Objective To assess the screening and isolation measures for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from newly admitted patients into a pediatric oncology ward. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with established hematologic malignancies admitted for chemotherapy from January 23 to March 27, 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Every patient and their caregivers were well educated on personal protection and put it into effect at home and in hospital. Screening for COVID-19 of all the patients and caregivers before admission was performed. Both clinical features and screening results including chest computerized tomography (CT); nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or anal swabs; and quantitative antibodies (IgM and IgG) detecting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of these patients were described. Results The results of nucleic acid and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing of all the 44 inpatients and their caregivers were negative. Abnormal chest CT images were observed in six symptomatic patients, while chest CT images of their caregivers did not show the changes related to viral pneumonia. These symptomatic patients all recovered after antibacterial combined with antifungal treatment, but without any antiviral agents. Conclusions COVID-19 infection could be prevented in pediatric patients with malignancies if proper protective measures were implemented. For patients presenting suspicious symptoms, comprehensive examinations should be carried out.	included

0	Population Point Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Based on a Statewide Random Sample - Indiana, April 25-29, 2020. Population prevalence of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), varies by subpopulation and locality. U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged >=12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70). In the random sample, higher overall prevalences were observed among Hispanics and those who reported having a household contact who had previously been told by a health care provider that they had COVID-19. By late April, an estimated 187,802 Indiana residents were currently or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (9.6 times higher than the number of confirmed cases [17,792]) (3), and 1,099 residents died (infection-fatality ratio = 0.58%). The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections. Given the large number of persons who remain susceptible in Indiana, adherence to evidence-based public health mitigation and containment measures (e.g., social distancing, consistent and correct use of face coverings, and hand hygiene) is needed to reduce surge in hospitalizations and prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 specific serological pattern in healthcare workers of an Italian COVID-19 forefront hospital. Background COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The immunopathogenesis of the infection is currently unknown. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at highest risk of infection and disease. Aim of the study was to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an Italian cohort of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients. Methods A point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (BioMedomics IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Rapid Test) was adopted to assess the prevalence of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. It was ethically approved (”Milano Area 1” Ethical Committee prot. n. 2020/ST/057). Results A total of 202 individuals (median age 45 years; 34.7% males) were retrospectively recruited in an Italian hospital (Milan, Italy). The percentage (95% CI) of recruited individuals with IgM and IgG were 14.4% (9.6-19.2%) and 7.4% (3.8-11.0%), respectively. IgM were more frequently found in males (24.3%), and in individuals aged 20-29 (25.9%) and 60-69 (30.4%) years. No relationship was found between exposure to COVID-19 patients and IgM and IgG positivity. Conclusions The present study did show a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in Italian HCWs. New studies are needed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients, as well the role of neutralizing antibodies.	included

We describe the contact investigation for an early confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States. Contacts of the case-patient were identified, actively monitored for symptoms, interviewed for a detailed exposure history, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and ELISA. Fifty contacts were identified and 38 (76%) were interviewed, of whom 11 (29%) reported unprotected face-to-face interaction with the case-patient. Thirty-seven (74%) had respiratory specimens tested by rRT-PCR, and all tested negative. Twenty-three (46%) had ELISA performed on serum samples collected =6 weeks after exposure, and none had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Among contacts who were tested, no secondary transmission was identified in this investigation, despite unprotected close interactions with the infectious case-patient.Copyright © 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

0	Serologic Detection of Latent SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Hemodialysis Centers: A Multi-center, Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are a population highly vulnerable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese MHD patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened by blood tests, chest computed tomography, NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME(S): Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL: Approach Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to with positive serology tests and negative NAT. RESULT(S): Of the 1027 MHD patients, 99 cases have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 infection, equivalent to a prevalence of 9.6%. In the 99 cases, 52 (53%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (48%) patients were identified by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with negative NAT. The spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients showed IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (75%), and both positive IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). 51% of the infected patients were asymptomatic during the epidemic. Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often identified with infection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and they tended to be more symptomatic than other patient groups. LIMITATIONS: Possibility of false positives and false negatives for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSION(S): Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in MHD patients were subclinical and unidentified by universal chest CT and selective NAT. Serologic testing may help to evaluate the overall prevalence and understand the diversity of clinical course among MHD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

0	Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York. PURPOSE: New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies., METHODS: We conducted a statewide seroprevalence study among a 15,101 patron convenience sample at 99 grocery stores in 26 counties throughout NYS. SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first post-stratification weighting then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing diagnoses by estimated infection-experienced adults., RESULTS: Based on 1,887 of 15,101 reactive results (12.5%), estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5-24.0%) and higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%) than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, p<.0001). An estimated 8.9% (95% CI: 8.4-9.3%) of infections in NYS were diagnosed, with diagnosis highest among adults >=55 years (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: From the largest US serosurvey to date, we estimated > 2 million adult New York residents were infected through late March, with substantial disparities, although cumulative incidence remained below herd immunity thresholds. Monitoring, testing, and contact tracing remain essential public health strategies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in blood in a large school community subject to a Covid-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affecting 52 people from a large school community in Santiago, Chile was identified (March 12), nine days after the first country case. We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey., METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission., RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool. Self-administered antibody testing, supervised remotely, proved to be a suitable and rapid tool. Our study provides useful information for school re-openings. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Novel coronavirus epidemic in the Hungarian population, a cross-sectional nationwide survey to support the exit policy in Hungary. After months of restrictive containment efforts to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, European countries are planning to reopen. To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy. NCT04370067, 30.04.2020.	included
0	"Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a serologic marker of infection. BACKGROUND: Thousands of medical staff had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with hundreds of deaths reported. Such loss could be prevented if there is a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHOD(S): Using CHO cell expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreaks or during the outbreak, and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULT(S): The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during the hospitalization and after been discharged for two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 out of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and one out of five nucleic acid test-negative ""Close contacts"" of COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSION(S): With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, in-coming patients, passengers and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders"", protect the medical staff and stop the further spreading of the virus.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Prevalence of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic threatens health care providers and society. For planning of treatment capacities, it is of major importance to obtain reliable information on infection and fatality rates of the novel coronavirus. A German community study, the so-called Heinsberg study, found a 5-fold higher infection rate (and thus a remarkably lower fatality rate) than the officially reported cases suggest. We were interested to examine the SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody status among clinic staff of a large neurological center in Northern Germany. Blood samples and questionnaires (demographic data, medical history) were collected pseudonymously. In total, 406 out of 525 (77.3%) of our employees participated in the study. The infection rate among the staff was as high as 2.7%. Including drop-outs (missing questionnaire but test result available), the infection rate was even higher (2.9%). Only 36% of the positively tested employees did suffer from flu-like symptoms in 2020. None of the nurses-having closest and longest contact to patients-were found to be positive. Despite the fact that the infection rate among clinic staff may not be directly compared to the situation in the surrounding county (due to different testing procedures), one might hypothesize that the infection rate could be more than 30-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for the county of Hameln-Pyrmont. The high rate of IgG-positive, asymptomatic healthcare workers might help to overcome fears in daily work.	included

OBJECTIVE: There is currently over 80,000 cases of COVID-19 in Arizona, and the number is rapidly increasing, leading the country in the rate of new daily cases. Exposure among first responders remains unknown., METHODS: Rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among first responders in Arizona were determined, and attitudes / views about the impact of COVID-19 on their work life was analyzed., RESULTS: Of 3,326 first responders, 50 (1.50%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Most first responders thought antibody testing would help ease their anxieties (62.5%) and be beneficial to their work-life (60.6%)., CONCLUSION: The rate of COVID-19 exposure among first responders in Arizona is low - 1.50%. COVID-19 is a concern among many of the first responders, and antibody testing was beneficial in easing their anxieties about going to work and performing work-related duties.	included

0	A comparison of four serological assays for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum samples from different populations. It is of paramount importance to evaluate the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their differing antibody response profiles. Here, we performed a pilot study of four serological assays to assess the amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples obtained from 491 healthy individuals before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 51 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, 209 suspected cases of COVID-19 with mild symptoms, and 200 healthy blood donors. We used two ELISA assays that recognized the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric spike (S) protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we developed the S-Flow assay that recognized the S protein expressed at the cell surface using flow cytometry, and the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay that recognized diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens including the 51 domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of N by immunoprecipitation.We obtained similar results with the four serological assays. Differences in sensitivity were attributed to the technique and the antigen used. High anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were associated with neutralization activity, which was assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotype virus. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, seroconversion and virus neutralization occurred between 5 and 14 days after symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 32% of mildly symptomatic individuals within 15 days of symptom onset and in 3% of healthy blood donors. The four antibody assays that we used enabled a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different subpopulations within one region.	included

Method(s): In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. Finding(s): A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. Interpretation(s): To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in India: Findings from the national serosurvey, May-June 2020. Background & objectives: Population-based seroepidemiological studies measure the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a country. We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India. Method(s): From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity. Result(s): Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases. The IFR in the surveyed districts from high stratum, where death reporting was more robust, was 11.72 (95% CI: 7.21-19.19) to 15.04 (9.26-24.62) per 10,000 adults, using May 24 and June 1, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported deaths. Interpretation & conclusions: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was low among the adult population in India around the beginning of May 2020. Further national and local serosurveys are recommended to better inform the public health strategy for containment and mitigation of the epidemic in various parts of the country.	included

Aim: Forecasting the prevalence of the disease is important for health departments to strengthen surveillance systems and reallocate resources. The aim of this study is to assess the occurrence of COVID-19 in Alkharj, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study that included data about the occurrence of COVID-19 cases in Alkharj, Saudi Arabia between the 12th of July, 2020 till 5th of august, 2020. Data were extracted from Saudi Ministry of Health official site and also from Saudi Ministry of Health page on Facebook. Results: The rate of cases in Alkharj were low in comparison with other cities. The number of population in Saudi Arabia was 34,871,847 in 2020. among of these people, More than 425,300 live in Alkharj. So Alkharj residents represent about 1.219 % of the total population in Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 cases in Alkharj represent only 0.576% of total cases in Saudi Arabia. In Alkharj, only 0.387 % of the population suffered from COVID-19 (out of 425,300 people there were 1646 COVID19 patients) Conclusion: This study showed a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases but still it is essential to implement the preventive measures to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases.	included

Immunity against the novel coronavirus infection in neonates born to mothers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 is an understudied field of research. The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The study was carried out in 20 mothers aged 19 to 39 years and 21 neonates (including a pair of twins). Babies born to mothers with elevated IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 also had elevated IgG. There is a hypothesis that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM are not passed on to the child across the placenta. In all cases studied in this work, neonates were PCR-negative for the virus, which suggests the absence of vertical COVID-19 transmission. Further research is needed.	included
0	High SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients. The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined among 105 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to four patients who were laboratory confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14th day of the quarantine, while the serum samples were obtained on the 14th day of the quarantine. With the assay of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and microneutralization assay, 17.14% (18/105) of HCWs were seropositive, while their swab samples were found to be SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Risk analysis revealed that wearing face mask could reduce the infection risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.127, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017, 0.968), while when exposed to COVID-19 patients, doctors might have higher risk of seroconversion (OR, 346.837, 95% CI 8.924, 13479.434), compared with HCWs exposed to colleagues as well as nurses and general service assistants who exposed to patients. Our study revealed that the serological testing is useful for the identification of asymptomatic or subclinical infection of SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts with COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 The British Infection Association	included
0	Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India – a prospective cohort study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are few data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0–7 days, 10–28 days and 6–10 weeks were 46%, 84.7% and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys. <h4>Summary</h4> We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC protein IgG in a multi-hospital-based prospective cohort from northern India up to ten weeks post-infection. The lower seroconversion rate among asymptomatic RT-PCR positive participants has public health significance particularly for interpreting community seroprevalence estimates.	false

0	"Chilblains and COVID-19: Can recent epidemiological data shed light on the etiological debate?. In March and April 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries imposed lockdown measures. Concurrently, a significant number of chilblains were observed in otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults. The physiopathology of these chilblains has not been completely elucidated and their direct link to COVID-19 remains unconfirmed and debated1 . RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were negative in most patient series reported2 . Lifestyle changes associated with lockdown - notably increased sedentariness and prolonged barefoot exposure to cold floors - in predisposed subjects (high number of patients with antinuclear antibodies positivity and low BMI) could be a possible explanation for the outbreak of chilblains3,4 . The underreporting of chilblain ""outbreaks"" in Nordic countries, where strict confinement was not imposed, could also indirectly point towards a link between confinement and chilblains5 .

0	Association between regional distributions of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and out-of-hospital sudden death during the first epidemic outbreak in New York. BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHOD(S): The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULT(S): Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman rho 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION(S): The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.Copyright © 2020 Heart Rhythm Society.

0	Impact of first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Weighting the risk of infection and flare. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) cohort; to assess correlations with disease characteristics and rheumatic therapy; and to evaluate the occurrence of treatment discontinuation and its impact on disease activity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLE patients monitored by a single Italian centre were interviewed between February and July 2020. Patients were considered to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections in case of 1) positive nasopharyngeal swab; 2) positive serology associated with COVID19 suggesting symptoms. The following data were also recorded: clinical symptoms, adoption of social distancing measures, disease activity and treatment discontinuation., RESULTS: 332 patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients (1.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the incidence being significantly higher in the subgroup of patients treated with biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (p = 0.005), while no difference was observed for other therapies, age at enrollment, disease duration, type of cumulative organ involvement or adoption of social isolation. The course of the disease was mild. Thirty-six patients (11.1%) discontinued at least part of their therapy during this time period, and 27 (8.1%) cases of disease flare were recorded. Correlation between flare and discontinuation of therapy was statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant increase of rate of flare in a subgroup of the same patients during 2020 was observed., CONCLUSION: Treatment discontinuation seems to be an important cause of disease flare. Our findings suggest that abrupt drug withdrawal should be avoided or evaluated with caution on the basis of individual infection risk and comorbidities.	false

0	COVID-19 and immunological dysregulation: can autoantibodies be useful?. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often associated with interstitial pneumonia. However, there is insufficient knowledge on the presence of autoimmune serological markers in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed the presence and role of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia. We prospectively studied 33 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 31 (94%) of whom had interstitial pneumonia, and 25 age- and sex-matched patients with fever and/or pneumonia with etiologies other than COVID-19 as the pathological control group. All patients were tested for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs), and anti-cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCAs). Clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters were also collected. Fifteen of 33 (45%) patients tested positive for at least one autoantibody, including 11 who tested positive for ANAs (33%), 8 who tested positive for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (24%), and 3 who tested positive for anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (9%). ANCA reactivity was not detected in any patient. Patients that tested positive for autoantibodies had a significantly more severe prognosis than other patients did: 6 of 15 (40%) patients with autoantibodies died due to COVID-19 complications during hospitalization, whereas only 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients who did not have autoantibodies died (p = 0.03). Patients with poor prognosis (death due to COVID-19 complications) had a significantly higher respiratory rate at admission (23 breaths per minute vs. 17 breaths per minute; p = 0.03) and a higher frequency of autoantibodies (86% vs. 27%; p = 0.008). In conclusion, autoantibodies are frequently detected in patients with COVID-19 possibly reflecting a pathogenetic role of immune dysregulation. However, given the small number of patients, the association of autoantibodies with an unfavorable prognosis requires further multicenter studies.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients with cancer and oncology healthcare workers: A multicenter, prospective study. Background: Poor outcomes for patients with cancer and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (COVID-19) have been reported so far. Although anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response is usually detectable within three weeks after infection, limited information on the seroconversion rate of patients with cancer infected by SARS-CoV-2 is available. Method(s): This is a multicenter, observational, prospective study that included patients and oncology healthcare workers (HCWs) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or clinical/radiological suspicious of infection as well as patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection. All subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassett for the fast detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rates by qualitative assay in patients with cancer and HCWs with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. Result(s): At first interim analysis, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Cancer patients and HCWs were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. HCWs were younger than patients with cancer (median age 41 vs 62 years; P<0.001). Eighty-six subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, while forty-nine (29.5%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19 in absence of RT-PCR confirmation. In patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 62 (83.8%) were IgG-positive. Neither differences in terms of IgG positivity (87.9% vs 80.5%; P=0.39) nor in median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to IgG detection (23.0 vs 28.0 days; P=0.21) were found between patients with cancer and HCWs. Conclusion(s): Our data show that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody response is not different between cancer patients and healthy subjects. Qualitative rapid test for antibody detection represents an useful support to RNA RT-PCR testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-risk populations, including patients with cancer.

0	Preliminary Data of a Quantitative Point of Care Test for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies From Greece. BACKGROUND: Antibody testing is necessary to identify immune individuals in the post-initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the performance of a quantitative point-of-care test (POCT) for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The patient group (PG) comprised of hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 cases. Asymptomatic healthcare volunteers with negative rRT-PCR were included in the control group (CG). Measurement of IgM and IgG was obtained by dry fluorescence immunoassay., RESULTS: Twenty-six PG (65.9+/-15.4 years old, male 57.7%) and 18 CG (45.6+/-10.1 years old, male 33.3%) were included. By manufacturer's cut-off (>=0.04 mIU/ml), sensitivity and specificity were 73.08% and 88.89% for IgM and 88.46% and 33.33% for IgG, respectively. Estimated areas under the ROC curve were 0.907 and 0.848 for IgM and IgG, respectively. Results were improved using a cut-off of IgM >=0.05 mIU/ml and IgG >=0.10 mIU/ml., CONCLUSION: Using stringent cut-off values, SARS-CoV-2 antibody POCT detects immune people and can be used during socioeconomic normalization of communities.

0	Clinical and laboratory evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow assays for use in a national COVID-19 seroprevalence survey. BACKGROUND: Accurate antibody tests are essential to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver testing at scale. However, reported performance varies, and sensitivity analyses have generally been conducted on serum from hospitalised patients. For use in community testing, evaluation of finger-prick self-tests, in non-hospitalised individuals, is required. METHOD(S): Sensitivity analysis was conducted on 276 non-hospitalised participants. All had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR and were >=21days from symptom onset. In phase I, we evaluated five LFIAs in clinic (with finger prick) and laboratory (with blood and sera) in comparison to (1) PCR-confirmed infection and (2) presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on two 'in-house' ELISAs. Specificity analysis was performed on 500 prepandemic sera. In phase II, six additional LFIAs were assessed with serum. FINDINGS: 95% (95% CI 92.2% to 97.3%) of the infected cohort had detectable antibodies on at least one ELISA. LFIA sensitivity was variable, but significantly inferior to ELISA in 8 out of 11 assessed. Of LFIAs assessed in both clinic and laboratory, finger-prick self-test sensitivity varied from 21% to 92% versus PCR-confirmed cases and from 22% to 96% versus composite ELISA positives. Concordance between finger-prick and serum testing was at best moderate (kappa 0.56) and, at worst, slight (kappa 0.13). All LFIAs had high specificity (97.2%-99.8%). INTERPRETATION: LFIA sensitivity and sample concordance is variable, highlighting the importance of evaluations in setting of intended use. This rigorous approach to LFIA evaluation identified a test with high specificity (98.6% (95%CI 97.1% to 99.4%)), moderate sensitivity (84.4% with finger prick (95%CI 70.5% to 93.5%)) and moderate concordance, suitable for seroprevalence surveys.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Community-Level Factors Associated With Racial And Ethnic Disparities In COVID-19 Rates In Massachusetts. Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities of COVID-19 is critical to inform public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts towns/cities (01/01/2020-05/06/2020) and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population was associated with a 312.3 increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born non-citizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted, and may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign born non-citizens, address crowded housing, and protect food-service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities.

0	Trends in Number and Distribution of COVID-19 Hotspot Counties - United States, March 8-July 15, 2020. The geographic areas in the United States most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have changed over time. On May 7, 2020, CDC, with other federal agencies, began identifying counties with increasing COVID-19 incidence (hotspots) to better understand transmission dynamics and offer targeted support to health departments in affected communities. Data for January 22-July 15, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively (January 22-May 6) and prospectively (May 7-July 15) to detect hotspot counties. No counties met hotspot criteria during January 22-March 7, 2020. During March 8-July 15, 2020, 818 counties met hotspot criteria for >=1 day; these counties included 80% of the U.S. population. The daily number of counties meeting hotspot criteria peaked in early April, decreased and stabilized during mid-April-early June, then increased again during late June-early July. The percentage of counties in the South and West Census regions* meeting hotspot criteria increased from 10% and 13%, respectively, during March-April to 28% and 22%, respectively, during June-July. Identification of community transmission as a contributing factor increased over time, whereas identification of outbreaks in long-term care facilities, food processing facilities, correctional facilities, or other workplaces as contributing factors decreased. Identification of hotspot counties and understanding how they change over time can help prioritize and target implementation of U.S. public health response activities.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a National Healthcare System: the Qatar Experience. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection. METHOD(S): The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10-June 24, 2020. Data on COVID-19+ HCW were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. RESULT(S): Among 16,912 HCW tested, 10.6% tested positive. Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. In a follow-up survey of 393 HCW, 5% reported acquiring infection at a COVID-19-designated facility and 95% at a non-COVID-19 facility having acquired the infection through accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or a patient (29%). Full PPE adherence was 82% at COVID-19-designated but only 68% at non-COVID-19 facilities. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 infection among HCW often occurs among those not directly working with COVID-19 patients. PPE use is less stringent in such settings. Risk of exposure and need for strict PPE must be stressed upon all HCW in all settings.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Patients With Cancer Treated at a Tertiary Care Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic. PURPOSE: To analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer in hospital care after implementation of institutional and governmental safety measurements. METHOD(S): Patients with cancer routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction between March 21 and May 4, 2020, were included. The results of this cancer cohort were statistically compared with the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Austrian population as determined by a representative nationwide random sample study (control cohort 1) and a cohort of patients without cancer presenting to our hospital (control cohort 2). RESULT(S): A total of 1,688 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1,016 consecutive patients with cancer were performed. A total of 270 of 1,016 (26.6%) of the patients were undergoing active anticancer treatment in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant and 560 of 1,016 (55.1%) in a palliative setting. A total of 53 of 1,016 (5.2%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19. In 4 of 1,016 (0.4%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected. At the time of testing at our department, all four SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were asymptomatic, and two of them had recovered from symptomatic COVID-19. Viral clearance was achieved in three of the four patients 14-56 days after testing positive. The estimated odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between the cancer cohort and control cohort 1 was 1.013 (95% CI, 0.209 to 4.272; P = 1), and between control cohort 2 and the cancer cohort it was 18.333 (95% CI, 6.056 to 74.157). CONCLUSION(S): Our data indicate that continuation of active anticancer therapy and follow-up visits in a large tertiary care hospital are feasible and safe after implementation of strict population-wide and institutional safety measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients with cancer seems advisable to detect asymptomatic virus carriers and avoid uncontrolled viral spread.	false
0	Homeless Shelter Characteristics and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. INTRODUCTION: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators., RESULTS: A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.	false

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) in Italians and in immigrants in an area of Northern Italy (Reggio Emilia). It has been hypothesized that bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, can be protective against Covid-19. Using data of performed swabs and RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the Reggio Emilia province (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) from March 6th to March 26th, 2020, we computed age, gender, and place of birth (Italy or abroad) specific risk of being tested, prevalence of positive tests, and probability of testing positive given that a swab has been taken during the epidemic peak. We report that immigrants resident in Reggio Emilia province, mostly coming from Countries with high BCG vaccination coverage, and Italians had a similar prevalence of infection (odds ratio - OR 0.99; 95%CI 0.82-1.20) and similar probability of being tested (OR 0.93; 95%CI 0.81-1.10). Our data do not support the hypothesis that immigrants from Countries where BCG vaccination is recommended have a lower risk of Covid-19 infection.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in Norway: confirmed infection, hospitalisations and underlying conditions. BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents are at lower risk of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. We describe the incidence of confirmed infection and hospitalisation of children and adolescents under the age of 20 in Norway, and specifically among those with underlying conditions., MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Norwegian Directorate of Health has collaborated with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on the establishment of a data extraction system to monitor the coronavirus outbreak. Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR), and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) are linked to data on positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). This covers all persons living in Norway as of 1 March 2020, with data on confirmed infection up to and including 13 May 2020 and on hospitalisations up to and including 30 April 2020., RESULTS: Of 8 125 persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the whole population, 493 (6.1 %) were under 20 years old. The median age of the under-20s was 15 years, and 252 (51 %) were girls. 3 % were hospitalised. No deaths were registered among patients aged under 20 in Norway. We found a somewhat larger share with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the group with diseases of the neuromuscular system., INTERPRETATION: Few children and adolescents have had SARS-CoV-2 confirmed, and only a very few have been hospitalised. Underlying conditions may result in a lower threshold for testing, and hence a higher incidence of confirmed infection in this group, although higher risk cannot be excluded.	false
0	Epidemiological, virological and serological features of COVID-19 cases in people living with HIV in Wuhan City: A population-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and serological features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in people living with HIV (PLWH)., METHODS: This population-based cohort study identified all COVID-19 cases among the whole PLWH in Wuhan city, China, by April 16, 2020. The epidemiological, virological and serological features were analyzed based on the demographic data, temporal profile of nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 during the disease, and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG after recovery., RESULTS: From January 1 to April 16, 2020, 35 of 6001 PLWH have experienced COVID-19, with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 to be 0.58% (95%CI: 0.42%-0.81%). Among the COVID-19 cases, 15 (42.86%) had severe illness, with 2 deaths. The incidence, case-severity and case-fatality of COVID-19 in PLWH were comparable to that in the entire population in Wuhan. 197 persons had cART discontinuation, of whom 4 persons experienced COVID-19. Risk factors for COVID-19 were age >=50 years old and cART discontinuation. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding among confirmed COVID-19 cases in PLWH was 30 (IQR: 20-46) days. Cases with high HIV viral load (>=20 copies/ml) had lower IgM and IgG levels than those with low HIV viral load (<20 copies/ml) (median S/CO for IgM, 0.03 vs. 0.11, P<0.001; median S/CO for IgG, 10.16 vs. 17.04, P=0.069)., CONCLUSIONS: Efforts need to maintain the persistent supply of antiretroviral treatment to elderly PLWH aged 50 years or above during the COVID-19 epidemic. The coinfection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 might change the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in PLWH. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) between February 24th to April 30th, 2020 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHOD(S): We designed a retrospective cohort study. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for all HCWs and categorized according to presumed level of COVID-19 exposure (high, medium and low). RESULT(S): Among 1,911 HCW, 213 (11.1%) had COVID-19 during the study period. Cases increased gradually from March 8th, peaking in March 17th and declining thereafter. The peak of cases among HCWs was reached 14 days before the peak in admitted COVID-19 cases in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (p=0.123). There were 5 departments and 2 professions in which more than 20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. We identified temporal clusters in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than 5 days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and 1 patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (IQR: 15 - 26) days. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that HCW-to-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave.Copyright © 2020 The Healthcare Infection Society.

0	D614G Spike Variant Does Not Alter IgG, IgM, or IgA Spike Seroassay Performance. Emergence of a new variant of spike protein (D614G) with increased infectivity and transmissibility has prompted many to analyze the potential role of this variant in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants. This is an important finding both for SARS-CoV-2 disease biology and for potential antibody-based therapeutics.	false
0	COVID-19 in Children: An Ample Review. The aim of this review was to describe the current knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) in children, from epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory perspectives, including knowledge on the disease course, treatment, and prognosis. An extensive literature search was performed to identify papers on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) in children, published between January 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. There were 44 relevant papers on COVID-19 in children. The results showed that COVID-19 occurs in 0.39-12.3% of children. Clinical signs and symptoms are comparable to those in adults, but milder forms and a large percentage of asymptomatic carriers are found among children. Elevated inflammatory markers are associated with complications and linked to various co-infections. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans in children revealed structural changes similar to those found in adults, with consolidations surrounded by halos being somewhat specific for children with COVID-19. The recommended treatment includes providing symptomatic therapy, with no specific drug recommendations for children. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults. This review highlights that COVID-19 in children is similar to the disease in the adult population, but with particularities regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, chest imaging, and treatment. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults, but with the progression of the pandemic; the cases in children might change in the future. Copyright © 2020 Ciuca.	false

0	Concordance between two rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between two rapid detection tests (RDT) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that used a random sample of non-hospitalized patients from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon (58 RT-PCR-positive cases and 52 RT-PCR-negative cases). Information regarding symptoms was collected and all patients were simultaneously tested using two RDTs (Combined - cRDT and Differentiated - dRDT). The results of both tests were evaluated using the chi-square test and, for degree of agreement, the kappa coefficient., RESULTS: About 52% of the participants were women (mean age: 48.2+/-11.0 years). A total of 58.2% were positive for d-RDT and 41.2% were positive for c-RDT. In the subjects who were RT-PCR-positive, d-RDT was positive in 72.4% and c-RDT in 55.2%; in those who were RT-PCR-negative, the percentages were 42.3% and 26.9%, respectively. The kappa coefficient observed between the two RDTs was 0.644, and was higher in patients without a fever or anosmia (0.725) and lower in those with a fever or anosmia (0.524)., CONCLUSIONS: There is good agreement between the tests used in this study. Given the sensitivity observed, they can be very useful as a complement to RT-PCR. Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Medicos de Atencion Primaria (SEMERGEN). Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

0	Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review of Case Reports and Case Series. Introduction: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of hospitalized patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to April 24, 2020. There were no restrictions regarding publication language. Results: Eighty articles were included analyzing a total of 417 patients with a mean age of 48 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 62% of patients from 82% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies that reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (60%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (21%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (69%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for the presence and severity of the disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective investigations are necessary.	false

0	Estimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of China. During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.	false

BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged and caused the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide., METHODS: We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 1 February and 29 February 2020. Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen., RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG. IgM antibody appeared within a week post-disease onset, lasted for 1 month, and gradually decreased, whereas IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection and lasted for a longer time. However, no significant difference in levels of IgM and IgG antibodies between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that serological tests could be a powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.

Background: Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals with past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study design: Our study is the first to compare four new commercially available assays using 75 sera from patients tested positive or negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR: the anti SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun, Germany), the EDI New Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA, (Epitope diagnostics (EDI), USA), the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Germany), and the SARS-CoV-2 Virachip IgG (Viramed, Germany). Result(s): We found a sensitivity of 86.4 %, 100 %, 86.4 %, and 77.3 % and a specificity of 96,2 %, 88,7 %, 100 %, and 100 % for the Euroimmun assay, the EDI assay, the Mikrogen assay, and the Viramed assay, respectively. Conclusion(s): Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays have a sufficient specificity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections in China: A multicenter case series. BACKGROUND: As of April 18, 2020, over 2,000,000 patients had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) globally, and more than 140,000 deaths had been reported. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been documented recently. However, information on pediatric patients is limited. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric patients to provide valuable insight into the early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 in children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, observational study involves a case series performed at 4 hospitals in West China. Thirty-four pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 27 to February 23, 2020. The final follow-up visit was completed by March 16, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed for 34 pediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, interquartile range 10.00-94.25), among whom 14 males (41%) were included. All the patients in the current study presented mild (18%) or moderate (82%) forms of COVID-19. A total of 48% of patients were noted to be without a history of exposure to an identified source. Mixed infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients (18%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76%) and cough (62%). Expectoration (21%), vomiting (12%), and diarrhea (12%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A substantial increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (among 20 patients with available data; 85%) and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (among 29 patients with available data; 59%), whereas a decrease in prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (among 32 patients with available data; 78%). In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION(S): Our data systemically presented the clinical and epidemiological features, as well as the outcomes, of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Stratified analysis was performed between mild and moderate cases. The findings offer new insight into early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19.	false

0	Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study. Background: Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. Method(s): From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. Finding(s): Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1-5.0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days (95% CI 1.1-2.7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6.27 [95% CI 1.49-26.33] for household contacts and 7.06 [1.43-34.91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11.2% (95% CI 9.1-13.8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7.4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6.6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.5), with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days (95% CI 5.2-7.6). Interpretation(s): Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing - Questions to be asked. SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19 disease presents a major healthcare challenge of global dimensions. Laboratory diagnostics of infected patients, and the assessment of immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus presents a major cornerstone in handling the pandemic. Currently there is an increase in demand of antibody testing and a large number of tests are already marketed or in the late stage of development. However, the interpretation of test results depends on many variables and factors, including sensitivity, specificity, potential cross-reactivity and cross-protectivity; the diagnostic value of antibodies of different isotypes, the use of antibody testing in identification of acutely ill patients or in epidemiological settings. In this article the recently established COVID-19 Task Force of the German Society for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (DGKL) addresses these issues based on the currently available datasets in this rapidly moving field.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

0	Delayed specific IgM antibody responses observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide since it was confirmed as the causative agent of COVID-19. Molecular diagnosis of the disease is typically performed via nucleic acid-based detection of the virus from swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the positive rate from the commonly used specimens (swabs or sputum) was less than 75%. Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are needed to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Sera were collected from patients or healthy people in a local hospital in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were then detected using a SARS-CoV-2 IgM colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). Results were analysed in combination with sera collection date and clinical information. The GICA was found to be positive with the detected 82.2% (37/45) of RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as 32.0% (8/25) of clinically confirmed, RT-qPCR negative patients (4-14 days after symptom onset). Investigation of IgM-negative, RT-qPCR-positive COVID-19 patients showed that half of them developed severe disease. The GICA was found to be a useful test to complement existing PCR-based assays for confirmation of COVID-19, and a delayed specific IgM antibody response was observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Testing Asymptomatic Emergency Department Patients for Coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) in a Low Prevalence Region. The first cases of Coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 20191 . The literature demonstrates geographical variation with regards to estimates of infection incidence, suggesting that COVID-19 has been underdiagnosed in certain regions2,3 . The rate of asymptomatic infection has been estimated to be as high as 30.8%, which may help explain variation in incidence, particularly in regions with differing screening practices 3 . Transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic carriers has been reported in multiple family units, indicating that this mode of infection is important in understanding disease epidemiology and population risk4,5 .Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Focusing attention on cancer patients' frailty, Cancer Institute-IRCCS ""Fondazione Pascale"" in Naples has planned a tightened program of health surveillance for patients (PTs) and healthcare providers (HPs), in order to early detect and promptly quarantine subjects with SARSCoV-2 infection. This program requires a multidisciplinary asset, within which Laboratory plays a crucial role. In our experience, the attention has focused on application of biosafety conditions, as stated by World Health Organization's guidance. A validated internal protocol was derived from it. Laboratory diagnostic workflow provided 3 steps: 1) rapid immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG from plasma samples of PTs and HPs; 2) automated qualitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIAs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from serum samples of HPs; 3) Real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) of PTs and HPs. Health surveillance program planned an initial evaluation of PTs and HPs with rapid ICAs (automated tests being not available yet) and a further screening with molecular tests on NS sent to external COVID-19 reference Laboratories. Subsequently, our Laboratory was included in CORONET network, allowing us to perform molecular tests for SARSCoV-2. At the same time, availability of automated ECLIAs allowed us to screen HPs periodically, continuing to perform ICAs to all PTs afferent to hospital triage. At the beginning of the surveillance, rapid ICAs allowed to screen 1920 PTs (89 of which resulted positive, 4.63%) and 1050 HPs (48 positive, 4.57%). Subsequently, HPs' screening with ECLIAs revealed 25 positive subjects out of 1018 tested (2.46%). Early detection and quarantine of positive cases allowed to find very low percentages of positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects to molecular tests from NS: 1 positive out 2215 NS from HPs (0.05%) and 1 positive out of 742 NS from PTs (0.13%). All Laboratory staff efforts have been directed to guarantee an adequate turnaround time. The element ""time"" has been crucial to subject promptly to quarantine personnel identified as positive and to isolate patients affected, thus allowing health surveillance program to ensure an adequate protection for cancer patients afferent to our Institute."	false
0	The role of serum specific- SARS-CoV-2 antibody in COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread, resulting in considerable casualties and serious economic loss worldwide. Disease severity and related symptoms markedly vary among individuals. A large number of patients present atypical symptoms, which represent a big challenge for early diagnosis and prompt infection source isolation. Currently, COVID-19 diagnosis predominantly depends on nucleic acid tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens, but this method presents a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy. In the current review, we aim to present comprehensive evidence to clarify the utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a reference for use in the clinic.

0	Different Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Asymptomatic, Mild, and Severe Cases. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, not encountered before by humans. The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focused on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.

0	The diagnostic value of rapid anti IgM and IgG detecting tests in the identification of patients with SARS CoV-2 virus infection. Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.	false

0	COVID-19 testing strategy in response to infection among healthcare workers in a large non-COVID-designated hospital. Sarawak General Hospital, which is the only public access tertiary referral center in Sarawak State for all clinical specialties, was designated a hybrid hospital to treat both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. During the initial surge of patients admitted with COVID-19, there was also a corresponding increase in healthcare workers (HCWs) detected with COVID-19 infection. The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the healthcare services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to unnecessary quarantining, and protect the healthcare workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the healthcare workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper. Our findings might provide an evidence-based reference for the future planning of an optimal strategy with the least compromise in care for a larger proportion of non-COVID-19 patients amid efforts against COVID-19 in a large non-COVID-designated hospital with hybrid status.	false

0	Corona in Children: the Co-Ki Study: Relevance of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient pediatric services in Germany. Background: In Germany over 80% of children and adolescents are in the ambulatory care of registered pediatricians. These have a specific perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): For this reason, this professional group initiated a central recording of case numbers, individual case descriptions and observations on infections and illnesses with SARS-CoV-2 (www.co-ki.de). Result(s): So far 557 pediatricians have participated. Together they care for ca. 670,000 children. They reported 9803 children who presented as suspected cases. The pediatricians themselves had a clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 3654 children. In 7707 children PCR tests were carried out using nose/throat swabs of which 198 (2.6%) were positive. In addition, 731 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with detection in 82 cases (11.2%). Despite initially positive PCR tests, 47 children had a negative antibody test at least 2 weeks later. Our query as to infections of adults by children yielded only one case, which a telephone enquiry revealed as unlikely. Discussion(s): From an outpatient pediatric perspective COVID-19 is rare. There was no convincing evidence that children are a relevant source of infection for SARS-CoV-2 nor that they are relevantly at risk.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Facility-Wide Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes - Seven U.S. Jurisdictions, March-June 2020. Undetected infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributes to transmission in nursing homes, settings where large outbreaks with high resident mortality have occurred (1,2). Facility-wide testing of residents and health care personnel (HCP) can identify asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections and facilitate infection prevention and control interventions (3-5). Seven state or local health departments conducted initial facility-wide testing of residents and staff members in 288 nursing homes during March 24-June 14, 2020. Two of the seven health departments conducted testing in 195 nursing homes as part of facility-wide testing all nursing homes in their state, which were in low-incidence areas (i.e., the median preceding 14-day cumulative incidence in the surrounding county for each jurisdiction was 19 and 38 cases per 100,000 persons); 125 of the 195 nursing homes had not reported any COVID-19 cases before the testing. Ninety-five of 22,977 (0.4%) persons tested in 29 (23%) of these 125 facilities had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The other five health departments targeted facility-wide testing to 93 nursing homes, where 13,443 persons were tested, and 1,619 (12%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. In regression analyses among 88 of these nursing homes with a documented case before facility-wide testing occurred, each additional day between identification of the first case and completion of facility-wide testing was associated with identification of 1.3 additional cases. Among 62 facilities that could differentiate results by resident and HCP status, an estimated 1.3 HCP cases were identified for every three resident cases. Performing facility-wide testing immediately after identification of a case commonly identifies additional unrecognized cases and, therefore, might maximize the benefits of infection prevention and control interventions. In contrast, facility-wide testing in low-incidence areas without a case has a lower proportion of test positivity; strategies are needed to further optimize testing in these settings.	false

0	Robust neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection persist for months. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with millions infected and numerous fatalities. Questions regarding the robustness, functionality, and longevity of the antibody response to the virus remain unanswered. Here we report that the vast majority of infected individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 experience robust IgG antibody responses against the viral spike protein, based on a dataset of 30,082 individuals screened at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We also show that titers are relatively stable for at least a period approximating 5 months and that anti-spike binding titers significantly correlate with neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggests that more than 90% of seroconverters make detectible neutralizing antibody responses. These titers remain relatively stable for several months after infection.

0	Preliminary study of serum 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Objective: To analyze the clinical value of serum 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method(s): A total of 116 patients diagnosed with NCP in the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University were enrolled from January to February 2020 as the disease group. A total of 134 cases, including 84 non-NCP inpatients and 50 healthy individuals served as the control group. Serum samples from all subjects were collected. A fully-automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer was used to detect the concentration of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody single test and combined detection were compared using the chi2 test. chi2 test and Wilcoxon's rank sum test were used to compare the positive rates and concentrations of IgM and IgG antibodies in NCP patients before and after their 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests turning negative, respectively. The change trend of 2019-nCoV antibody concentration in the process of NCP patients was analyzed by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Result(s): The sensitivity of 2019-nCoV IgG (90.5%, 105/116) was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM (75.9%, 88/116), the difference was statistically significant (chi2=8.91, P<0.05); The specificity of 2019-nCoV IgG (99.3%,133/134) was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM (94.0%, 126/134), the difference was statistically significant (chi2=5.63,P<0.05). The sensitivity (89.7%,87/97) of 2019-nCoV IgM combined with IgG was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM, the difference was statistically significant (chi2=6.89,P<0.05). The specificity (100%, 125/125) of 2019-nCoV IgM combined with IgG was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM, the difference was statistically significant (chi2=7.70, P<0.05). After 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test converted to negative, the positive rate (9/17) and concentration [13.0 (4.9, 24.7) AU/ml] of serum 2019-nCoV IgM antibody were significantly lower than those when the nucleic acid test was positive, positive rate (15/17) and concentration [29.5 (14.0, 61.3) AU/ml], respectively (chi2=5.10, Z=-3.195, both P<0.05). In the course of NCP, patients' serum samples were collected from the first day of diagnosis to every three days, three times in total. The first 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody concentrations [19.4 (12.4, 63.7) AU/ml, 105.8 (74.8, 126.1) AU/ml, respectively] were significantly higher than the second concentrations [15.8 (7.1, 40.3)AU/ml, 80.5 (66.7, 105.9) AU/ml], Z were-2.897,-3.179, both P<0.05. Conclusion(s): 2019-nCoV IgG antibody has a good application value in the diagnosis of NCP. The concentration of 2019-nCoV IgM antibody has a certain correlation with the detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. The combination of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test may be the best laboratory index for the diagnosis of NCP at present.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false

0	COVID-19 in cancer patients on systemic anti-cancer therapies: outcomes from the CAPITOL (COVID-19 Cancer PatIenT Outcomes in North London) cohort study. Background: Patients with cancer are hypothesised to be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19, leading to changes in treatment pathways in those treated with systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT). This study investigated the outcomes of patients receiving SACT to assess whether they were at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe outcomes. Method(s): Data was collected from all patients receiving SACT in two cancer centres as part of CAPITOL (COVID-19 Cancer PatIenT Outcomes in North London). The primary outcome was the effect of clinical characteristics on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in patients on SACT. We used univariable and multivariable models to analyse outcomes, adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. Result(s): A total of 2871 patients receiving SACT from 2 March to 31 May 2020 were analysed; 68 (2.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Cancer patients receiving SACT were more likely to die if they contracted COVID-19 than those who did not [adjusted (adj.) odds ratio (OR) 9.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.73-16.9]. Receiving chemotherapy increased the risk of developing COVID-19 (adj. OR 2.99; 95% CI = 1.72-5.21), with high dose chemotherapy significantly increasing risk (adj. OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.35-6.48), as did the presence of comorbidities (adj. OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.19-4.38), and having a respiratory or intrathoracic neoplasm (adj. OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.04-4.36). Receiving targeted treatment had a protective effect (adj. OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.95). Treatment intent (curative versus palliative), hormonal- or immunotherapy and solid versus haematological cancers had no significant effect on risk. Conclusion(s): Patients on SACT are more likely to die if they contract COVID-19. Those on chemotherapy, particularly high dose chemotherapy, are more likely to contract COVID-19, while targeted treatment appears to be protective.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.	false

0	Using Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Antibodies to Detect Outpatient Cases with Olfactory and Taste Disorders Suspected as Mild Form of COVID-19: a Retrospective Survey. Many patients with olfactory disorders were referred during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The aim of this study was to detect outpatient cases with olfactory and taste disorders suspected to mild form of COVID-19 disease in Gorgan city in the north of Iran retrospectively. This study was performed on patients who had the complaints of olfactory disorders during 03/01/2020 to 04/01/2020. They also had the mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The control group included patients who had similar symptoms during this period but did not report olfactory or taste disturbances. Due to the limitations of serologic kits, this study was performed 2-3 months after the onset of symptoms. The number of patients and controls was 72 and 36 respectively. The range and the mean +/- SD of patient's age were 21-63 and 39.82 +/- 9.82 years. In both groups, 44.44% were male and 55.56% were female. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and the serologic tests in both groups was 91.11 +/- 16.20 days. In the cases and controls, the IgG titer was positive in 44.4% and 22.2% and the IgM titer was positive in 5.6% and 8.3% respectively. IgG antibody titers were higher in cases than in the control group (P = 0.024). There was no correlation among antibody titers and the severity of olfactory disturbances, the gender, and the age. The high COVID-19 IgG antibody titer in patients with olfactory disorder during the pandemic can probably be considered as a warning complaint of COVID-19 and may be used for isolation plans.

0	Low prevalence (0.13%) of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic pre-operative/pre-procedure patients at a large, academic medical center informs approaches to perioperative care. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reduced performance of elective surgeries and procedures at medical centers across the United States. Awareness of the prevalence of asymptomatic disease is critical for guiding safe approaches to operative/procedural services. As COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has been limited largely to symptomatic patients, health care workers, or to those in communal care centers, data regarding asymptomatic viral disease carriage are limited. Method(s): In this retrospective observational case series evaluating UCLA Health patients enrolled in pre-operative/pre-procedure protocol COVID-19 reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020, we determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients scheduled for surgeries and procedures. Result(s): Primary outcomes include the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in this asymptomatic population. Secondary data analysis includes overall population testing results and population demographics. Eighteen of 4,751 (0.38%) patients scheduled for upcoming surgeries and high-risk procedures had abnormal (positive/inconclusive) COVID-19 RT-PCR testing results. Six of 18 patients were confirmed asymptomatic and had positive test results. Four of 18 were confirmed asymptomtic and had inconclusive results. Eight of 18 had positive results in the setting of recent symptoms or known COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 0.13%. More than 90% of patients had residential addresses within a 67-mile geographic radius of our medical center, the median age was 58, and there was equal male/female distribution. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrating low levels (0.13% prevalence) of COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic population of patients undergoing scheduled surgeries/procedures in a large urban area have helped to inform perioperative protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing protocols like ours may prove valuable for other health systems in their approaches to safe procedural practices during COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Unexpected high frequency of unspecific reactivities by testing pre-epidemic blood specimens from Europe and Africa with SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM antibody rapid tests points IgM as Achilles heel. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of false positive test results of 3 rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM detection., METHODS: Two serum panels from patients hospitalized in Paris, France, and from patients living in Bangui, Central African Republic, acquired prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, were tested by 3 CE IVD-labeled RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 serology [BIOSYNEX R COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM); SIENNA TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; NG-Test R IgG-IgM COVID-19]., RESULTS: Detectable IgG or IgM reactivities could be observed in 31 (3.43%) of the 902 IgG and IgM bands of the 3 RDTs used with all pre-epidemic sera. The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% versus 0.66%). The test NG-Test R IgG-IgM COVID-19 showed the highest rates of IgG or IgM reactivities [6.12% (18/294)], while the test BIOSYNEX R COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) showed the lowest rate [1.36% (4/294)]. Some combinations of 2 RDTs in series allowed decreasing significantly the risk of false positive test results., CONCLUSION: Our observations point the risk of false positive reactivities when using currently available RDT for SARS-CoV-2 serological screening, especially for the IgM band, even if the test is CE IVD-labeled and approved by national health authorities, and provide the rational basis for confirmatory testing by another RDT in case of positive initial screening.

0	Effectiveness of personal protective equipment in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection among healthcare workers. Introduction: Information on the effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among healthcare workers (HCWs), especially among HCWs with frequent contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2, is limited. Method(s): We conducted a prospective cohort study on 49 HCWs who worked in close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. HCWs had blood samples taken every 2 weeks to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two different types of assay. Result(s): Forty-nine participants (31 nurses, 15 doctors, 3 other workers) were enrolled. In total, 112 blood samples are obtained from participants. The median work days in 2 weeks was 9 (interquartile range (IQR): 5-10) days. In a single work day, 30 of the 49 participants (61.5%) had contact with patients with suspected or conformed SARS-CoV-2 at least 8 times, and approximately 60% of participants had more than 10 min of contact with a single patient. The median self-reported compliance to PPE was 90% (IQR: 80-100%). Seven participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, none were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, so the positive ELISA results were assumed to be false-positive. Conclusion(s): The study provides evidence that appropriate PPE is sufficient to prevent infection amongHCWs. It is necessary to establish a system that provides a stable supply of PPE for HCWs to perform their duties.Copyright © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases	false
0	Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals in the general population of northern Italy and evaluation of a diagnostic serological ELISA test: a cross-sectional study protocol. INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had infected more than 3 172 000 individuals, killing over 224 000 people and spreading to more than 200 countries. Italy was the most affected country in Europe and the third most affected in the world in terms of the number of cases. Therefore, the aims of this study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals among the general population of Verona; (2) to assess the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of an ELISA serological test for the screening of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be carried out on a random sample of subjects aged at least 10 years from the general population of Verona. Participants will undergo the measurement of vital parameters (oxygen saturation measured by oximeter, respiratory rate and body temperature detected by laser thermometer), the administration of a COVID-19-related symptoms questionnaire, the collection of a blood sample and a nasopharyngeal swab. Our evaluation will include the statistical technique of Latent Class Analysis, which will be the basis for the estimation of prevalence., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Verona and Rovigo provinces on 15 April 2020 (internal protocol number 2641CESC). The study results will be submitted for publication in international, peer-reviewed journals and the complete dataset will be deposited in a public repository. Most relevant data will be made available to policy-makers as well as disseminated to stakeholders and to the community. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	"236 Access to Covid-19 Testing by Homeless/Housing-Insecure Individuals in Northeast Ohio. Study Objectives: Homelessness and housing insecurity is a global public health issue that leads to increased mortality from a multitude of health conditions and low life expectancy. The complex interplay between medical, psychiatric and social factors raises questions about how this population accesses available health care resources. This is magnified in times of global health crises, such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients experiencing housing insecurity may have limited access to health care resources, and live in settings, such as homeless shelters, that place them at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions in this population puts them at high risk for developing severe illness associated with COVID-19. Therefore, how this population accesses COVID-19 testing is of public health interest. This study's objective was to compare the testing patterns of homeless/housing insecure patients for COVID-19, as well as results, compared to the general population across a large health system. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 15, 2020 were included, including drive-through, emergency department (ED)-based and inpatient testing. Homeless/housing-insecure patients were identified based on a previously utilized address-based registry: patients listing their address as ""homeless"" or using the address of transitional housing/homeless shelter during at least one ED visit across the health system between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics were calculated and compared with Chi-squared testing. Result(s): During the study period, 21,561 patients were tested for COVID-19, 94 of whom were identified as homeless/housing insecure (0.4%). 3/94 of these patients (3.2%) tested positive for COVID-19, compared to 2,027/21,467 patients (9.4%) in the general population. Out of all patients tested, 12,776 patients had a testing site listed, 78 of whom were homeless/housing insecure. Homeless/housing insecure individuals were significantly more likely to be tested for COVID-19 in the ED setting rather than drive-through testing, X2 (1, N = 12718) = 22.8, p <.00001) [Table 1]. Conclusion(s): In a regional health system during the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless and housing-insecure patients were reliant on the ED to access COVID-19 testing. Despite risk factors in this population for disease transmission, patients had a low likelihood of testing positive, suggesting that the disease is likely underdiagnosed in this population. Expanding testing availability outside of the ED may improve COVID-19 detection and interventions in homeless and housing insecure individuals, and thus inform public health interventions to reduce disease transmission in this high risk population.

0	The first two months epidimiological study of COVID-19, related public health preparedness, and response to the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan. As an underdeveloped country, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has posed a major risk to the health and economy of Pakistan. The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of epidemiologic analysis predicts that there should have been more cases since late March 2020 in Pakistan. We therefore sought to investigate COVID-19's prevalence and epidemiologic trends in Pakistan. Research for COVID-19 is still in its early stages, so data were collected from official websites and research journals, then analyzed for the disease's prevalence, epidemiology, mortality and recoveries. The results indicated that a rapid increase had indeed occurred in the number of COVID-19 infections in Pakistan, with the first case reported on 25 February, 2020. From 25 February 25 to April, 2020, COVID-19 infected 11,155 people in Pakistan, with 237 deaths (2.12%) and 2527 recoveries (19.96%). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the mortality ratio (r = 0.983, r 2 = 0.966; p <= 0.05). We concluded that proper management must be undertaken to improve the quarantine system, and the World Health Organization guidelines must be closely followed to cope with COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, so antiviral drugs (interferon alfa, ribavirin) may be useful to prevent COVID-19; however, severe control measures implemented in China have significantly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Suspected and confirmed cases must be treated in separate rooms. Staying home and social distancing are the safe way to proceed. Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in children - Understanding the immune responses and controlling the pandemic. In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection. With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention. A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

0	Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China. Background: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Finding(s): The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5-4.4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation(s): Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

0	Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, March 2020. BACKGROUND: As of March 31, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. METHOD(S): Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULT(S): The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.	false
0	The relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections among close contacts. Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic. A recent study in China showed that transmissibility of the asymptomatic cases is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

0	Low prevalence and disease severity of COVID-19 in post-liver transplant recipients-A single centre experience. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is driving a present day global pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are regarded as a high-risk cohort. The following is a short report on COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients (n = 5) from a high volume UK liver transplant unit with a large follow-up cohort (n = 4500). Based on this limited data, liver transplant recipients appear to have a low incidence of COVID-19, with less severe symptoms than expected, when compared with the general population and other solid organ recipients. This possibly could be related to self-isolation adherence and/or the 'ideal' level of immunosuppression that favourably modulates the immune response to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The impact of COVID-19 on African American communities in the United States. Importance: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes., Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study., Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties., Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included., Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty., Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02)., Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.	false
0	Screening and management of asymptomatic infection of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, the controlling of outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered into a critical period in China. Recently, work resumption and public place is planning to open outside of Hubei, suggesting an uncertain and complex development of the epidemic in the next stage. Few days ago, we conducted a study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections of COVID-19, and found them might be the infection source. We believe that the findings are critical for developing public health intervention strategies for controlling COVID-19 infection in the future. Screening among the high-risk population and improving the sensitivity of measurement may contribute to the detection and management of asymptomatic infection.	false
0	Significance of serology testing to assist timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections: implication from a family cluster. Confirmative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been challenged due to unsatisfactory positive rate of molecular assays. Here we identified a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with five of six family members were SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobin serology testing positive, while molecular assays only detected two of this five patients even repeated twice. We comprehensively analyzed this familial cluster of cases based on the clinical characteristics, chest CT images, SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection results, and serology testing results. At last, two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, two were suspected of COVID-19, and two were considered close contacts. Our results emphasized the significance of serology testing to assist timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially for COVID-19 close contacts screening.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	COVID-19 cases are less prevalent in countries where malaria is endemic, suggesting a role for anti-malarial drugs as prophylaxis. Almost every country across the world has felt the repercussions of the pandemic of disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A recently published article points to a method of prevention and prophylaxis of COVID-19 through the use of anti-malarial drugs such as the 4-aminoquinolones: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on their mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. This report aims to explore the correlation between COVID-19 cases and countries where malaria is prevalent using statistical means. It is hypothesized that countries where malaria is endemic will have few cases of COVID-19 since these countries use the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the numbers and incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths are substantially lower (multiple-fold lower) in countries with the highest prevalence of malaria. The difference between both the COVID-19 incidence rate and the COVID-19 mortality rate in malaria prevalent countries compared to COVID-19 prevalent countries is statistically significant (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). This study provides further evidence that anti-malaria drugs may prove essential to breaking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 related mortality. As the pandemic continues to evolve and doctors and researchers across the globe try to attenuate or stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the medical community should not overlook the potential role of the 4-aminoquinolones anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and 8-aminoquinolone anti-malaria drugs, tafenoquine and primaquine, as a prophylaxis.Copyright © Adams and Alshaban, 2020.	false
0	Dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and neutralizing antibody in children with COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and quickly spread globally. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs. Three of eight patients produced NAbs in the acute phase, and NAbs were detected in all eight patients with convalescent sera. The results of this study provide valuable information for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in children.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	New Insights of Emerging SARS-CoV-2: Epidemiology, Etiology, Clinical Features, Clinical Treatment, and Prevention. Since the first reports that the novel coronavirus was showing human-to-human transmission characteristics and asymptomatic cases, the number of patients with associated pneumonia has continued to rise and the epidemic has grown. It now threatens the health and lives of people across the world. The governments of many countries have attached great importance to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, via research into the etiology and epidemiology of this newly emerged disease. Clinical signs, treatment, and prevention characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia have been receiving attention worldwide, especially from medical personnel. However, owing to the different experimental methods, sample sizes, sample sources, and research perspectives of various studies, results have been inconsistent, or relate to an isolated aspect of the virus or the disease it causes. Currently, systematic summary data on the novel coronavirus are limited. This review combines experimental and clinical evidence into a systematic analysis and summary of the current progress of research into SARS-CoV-2, from multiple perspectives, with the aim of gaining a better overall understanding of the disease. Our report provides important information for current clinicians, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.© Copyright © 2020 Guo, Ye, Pan, Chen, Xing, Yan, Chen, Ding, Li, Huang, Zhang, Li and Xue.	false

An epidemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has appeared in Wuhan City in December 2019. The disease has shown a ""clustering epidemic"" pattern, and family-clustered onset has been the main characteristic. We collected data about 130 cases from 35 cluster-onset families (COFs) and 41 cases from 16 solitary-onset families (SOFs). The incidence of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in COFs was significantly higher than that of SOFs. Our study also showed that patients with exposure to high-risk factors (respiratory droplets and close contact), advanced age, and comorbidities were more likely to develop COVID-19 in the COFs. In addition, advanced age and elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were risk factors for death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COFs.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR. 194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative. The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%. However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroconversion in haematology-oncology patients. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019, the virus has spread rapidly across the globe leading to millions of infections and subsequent deaths. Although the virus infects those exposed indiscriminately, there are groups in society at an increased risk of severe infection, leading to increased morbidity. Patients suffering from haematological cancers, particularly leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma, may be one such group and previous studies have suggested that they may be at a 3-4 times greater risk of severe COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to admissions to ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death compared to those without such malignancies. Serological testing for IgG seroconversion has been extensively studied in the immunocompetent, but fewer publications have characterised this process in large series of immunocompromised patients. This study described 20 patients with haematological cancers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR with 12 of the patients receiving further serological testing. We found that of the 12 patients screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, only 2 (16.6%) were able to generate an immune response to the infection. Yet despite this low seroconversion rate in this cohort, none of these patients died or became particularly unwell with COVID-19 or its related complications. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on in-hospital mortality and surgical activity in elective digestive resections: A nationwide cohort analysis. BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has led to the reorganization of hospital care in several countries. The objective was to report the postoperative mortality after elective digestive resections in a nationwide cohort during the lockdown period., METHODS: This analytic study was performed using a national billing database (the Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Informations). Patients who underwent elective digestive resections were divided in 2 groups: the lockdown group defined by hospital admissions between March 17 and May 11, 2020; and the control group, defined by hospital admissions during the corresponding period in 2019. Groups were matched on propensity score, geographical region, and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the postoperative mortality., RESULTS: The overall population included 15,217 patients: 9,325 patients in the control group and 5,892 in the lockdown group. The overall surgical activity was decreased by 37% during the lockdown period. The overall in-hospital mortality during the hospital stay was 2.7%. After matching and adjustment, no difference in mortality between groups was reported (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.83-1.34; P = .669). An asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for a 2-fold increased mortality, whereas a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was associated with a 10-fold increased mortality., CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable reduction in the surgical activity for elective digestive resections during the lockdown period, mortality remained stable on a nationwide scale in COVID-free patients. These findings support that systematic COVID-19 screening should be advocated before elective gastrointestinal surgery and that all efforts should be made to maintain elective surgical resection for cancer during the second wave in COVID-free patients.

0	COVID-19 patients in intensive care develop predominantly oliguric acute kidney injury. Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk. Method(s): In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP-2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission. The majority (n = 51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n = 37, 65%), whereas stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30-day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n = 9 (17%) patients. Conclusion(s): A majority of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU develop AKI. The functional deficit is often low urinary volume, and initial levels of biomarkers are generally increased without clear relation to final AKI stage.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The protective role of cytotoxic T cells and interferon against coronavirus invasion of the brain. MHV-A59 causes focal acute encephalitis, acute hepatitis, and chronic demyelination while MHV-2 causes acute hepatitis and no brain involvement. The difference in organ tropism between these two closely related MHVs is not related to the ability of these viruses to grow in brain cells since both viruses grow equally well in primary glial cell cultures derived from neonatal mouse brains. We postulated therefore that the ability of the virus to stimulate certain host immunological factors may be important for protection of the brain against invasion and replication of the virus. In this study we performed preliminary experiments to investigate the potential role of two host factors in protection of the brain against MHV invasion: cytotoxic T cells and interferon. Four week old beta2M ((-/-)) mice, lacking beta2 microglobulin, MHC class 1 expression and functional cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were inoculated intracerebrally (IC) with MHV-2 and analyzed at various intervals post infection for histopathology and vital titers in organs. Histology revealed both acute hepatitis and acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis was observed in periventricular areas. Mononuclear lymphocytic infiltration involved the choroid plexus, the ependyma and in the surrounding brain parenchyma. There was no involvement of other areas of the brain including areas that are typically involved in A59 infection of C57B1/6 mice. By contrast, C57B1/6 mice infected with MHV-2 showed no involvement of the brain parenchyma and only slight inflammation of the choroid plexus was present. High titers of infectious virus was detected by plaque assay in both brains and livers of beta2M ((-/-)) mice infected with MHV-2 in contrast to only liver titers in C57B1/6 mice infected with a similar dose of MHV-2. Polyclonal rabbit-anti mouse IFN alpha/beta or anti IFN beta (Lee Biomolecular Research LAb.) was given to groups of 4-week-old C57B1/6 mice at a dose of 10,000 U per one I.P. treatment, 24 hours prior to I.C. inoculation of 1LD50 of MHV-2 or MHV-A59. At various intervals post inoculation virus tilers from brains and livers were determined by plaque assay, and the histopathology of all the internal organs was analyzed by H and E staining. Treatment with preimmune serum from the same rabbit was used as control with no effect on disease outcome in either one of the viruses. While IFN antibodies had little or no effect on the outcome of disease in MHV-A59 infection, mice treated with either anti IFN alpha/beta or anti IFN beta had high titers of virus recovered from the brain and histopathological evidence of acute meningoencephalitis. Thus cytotoxic T cells and interferon may have a protective role against brain invasion of the virus in MHV-2 infection in mice.	false
0	Dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China: a second derivative analysis of the cumulative daily diagnosed cases during the first 85 days. Background: Controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic requires information beyond new and cumulative cases. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei., Methods: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients' recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata., Results: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined., Conclusion: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long. In addition to re-evaluating the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, this study provided a model for monitoring outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries across the world.

0	Clinical outcomes of initially asymptomatic patients with COVID-19: a Korean nationwide cohort study. BACKGROUND: This study was performed to compare severe clinical outcome between initially asymptomatic and symptomatic infections and to identify risk factors associated with high patient mortality among initially asymptomatic patients., METHODS: In this retrospective, nationwide cohort study, we included 5621 patients who had been discharged from isolation or died from COVID-19 by 30 April 2020. The mortality rate and admission rate to intensive care unit (ICU) were compared between initially asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. We established a prediction model for patient mortality through risk factor analysis among initially asymptomatic patients., RESULTS: The prevalence of initially asymptomatic patients upon admission was 25.8%. The mortality rates were not different between groups (3.3% vs. 4.5%, p = .17). However, initially symptomatic patients were more likely to receive ICU care compared to initially asymptomatic patients (4.1% vs. 1.0%, p < .0001). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) was the most potent predictor for patient mortality in initially asymptomatic patients., CONCLUSIONS: The mortality risk was not determined by the initial presence of symptom among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The CCIS was the most potent predictors for mortality. The clinicians should predict the risk of death by evaluating age and comorbidities but not the initial presence of symptom. Key messages The mortality rate was not different between initially asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were more likely to admitted to the intensive care unit. Age and comorbidities were the potent risk factors for mortality.	false
0	Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis. OBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines., DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19., SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail., PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals., INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions)., RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days., CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.

0	Panbio TM rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 has acceptable accuracy in symptomatic patients in primary health care. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Panbio TM Ag-RDT at primary health care (PHC) centers and test sites in symptomatic patients and close contacts, using the Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test as the gold standard., METHODS: The study was conducted in four PHC centers and two test sites in Mallorca, Spain. Consecutive patients older than 18 years, attending the sites for RT-PCR testing were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected, one for RT-PCR and the other was processed on-site using the Panbio TM rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using RT-PCR as the reference, and the predictive values using the pretest probability results for each analyzed group., FINDINGS: A total of 1369 participants were included; mean age 42.5 +/- 14.9 years and 54.3% women. The overall prevalence was 10.2%. Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. The overall sensitivity was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load., INTERPRETATION: Ag-RDT had relatively good performance characteristics in suspected symptomatic patients within five days since the onset of symptoms. However, our data do not support the sole use of Panbio TM Ag-RDT in asymptomatic individuals., FUNDING: None. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Severe COVID-19 pneumonia and barotrauma: From the frying pan into the fire. <h4>Aim</h4> COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS (C-ARDS) has a high mortality. Preliminary reports indicate a higher incidence of barotrauma in patients with C-ARDS[1] both on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) This study examines the incidence and risk factors for barotrauma and change in outcomes after barotrauma in patients with severe C-ARDS on positive pressure respiratory support (PPRS). <h4>Methods and materials</h4> This is a retrospective study of C-ARDS associated barotrauma over 5 months in patients on PPRS in a tertiary COVID care center. The type of barotrauma, intervention, related factors, such as type of respiratory support (iMV vs NIV), airway pressure prior to the occurrence of barotrauma, and post-barotrauma outcomes were analyzed. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 38/410 (9.3%) C-ARDS patients on PPRS [mean age 57.82 ± 13.3 years, 32 males (84.2%)] developed barotrauma. Of these, 20 patients (52.6%) were on NIV and 18 (47.4%) patients were iMV on standard recommended settings. The median P/F ratio of patients on MV at the time of barotrauma was 116.4 (IQR 72.4, 193.25). The details of barotrauma were as follows: 24 patients had pneumothorax (PTX), 2 had pneumo-mediastinum and 12 had subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, 24/38 (63.2%) patients, including 15/18 (83.3%) on MV succumbed to their illness. The barotrauma happened a median of 6.5 days (IQR 4.75,13) after admission and 15 days (IQR 10.25,18.0) from symptom onset. The median duration from barotrauma to death was 7 days (IQR 2.25, 8.0) and barotrauma to discharge (for survivors) was 12.5 days (IQR 8.0, 21.25). All patients received steroids and 11/38 (28.9%) received additional immunosuppression with tocilizumab. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A high incidence of barotrauma was seen in this large series of severe C-ARDS patients on PPRS. Barotrauma led to further deterioration in the clinical status leading to a fatal outcome in the majority of the MV patients, despite prompt treatment.	false
0	Evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on dispensing patterns: a national cohort analysis. <h4>Background</h4> Medication prescribing and dispensing often regarded as one of the most effective ways to manage and improve population health. Prescribed and dispensed medications can be monitored through data linkage for each patient. We hypothesised that changes in patient care resulting from COVID-19, changed the way patients access their prescribed medication. <h4>Objective</h4> To develop an efficient approach for evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on drug dispensing patterns. <h4>Methods</h4> Retrospective observational study using national patient-level dispensing records in Wales-UK. Total dispensed drug items between 01-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2019 (counterfactual pre-COVID-19) were compared to 2020 (COVID-19 year). We compared trends of dispensed items in three main British National Formulary (BNF) sections(Cardiovascular system, Central Nervous System, Immunological & Vaccine) using European Age-Standardized rates. We developed an online tool to enable monitoring of changes in dispensing as the pandemic evolves. <h4>Result</h4> Amongst all BNF chapters, 52,357,639 items were dispensed in 2020 compared to 49,747,141 items in 2019 demonstrating a relative increase of 5.25% in 2020(95%CI[5.21,5.29]). Comparison of monthly patterns of 2020 and 2019 dispensed items showed a notable difference between the total number of dispensed drug items each month, with an average difference (D) of +290,055 and average Relative Change (RC) of +5.52%. The greatest RC was observed in a substantial March-2020 increase (D=+1,501,242 and RC=+28%), followed by second peak in June (D=+565,004, RC=+10.97%). May was characterised by lower dispensing (D=-399,244, RC=-5.9%). Cardiovascular categories were characterised, across all age groups, by dramatic March-2020 increases, at the epidemic peak, followed by months of lower than expected dispensing, and gradual recovery by September. The Central Nervous System category was similar, but with only a short decline in May, and quicker recovery. A stand-out grouping was Immunological and Vaccine, which dropped to very low levels across all age groups, and all months (including the March dispensing peak). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Aberration in clinical service delivery during COVID-19 led to substantial changes in community pharmacy drug dispensing. This change may contribute to a long-term burden of COVID-19, raising the importance of a comprehensive and timely monitoring of changes for evaluation of the potential impact on clinical care and outcomes	false
0	‘Trained immunity’ from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous ‘trained immunity’ conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. ( i . e ., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of ‘trained immunity’ of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se . It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.	false
0	The COVID-19 epidemic in Madagascar: clinical description and laboratory results of the first wave, march-september 2020. BACKGROUND: Following the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in passengers arriving from Europe on 19 March 2020, Madagascar took several mitigation measures to limit the spread of the virus in the country., METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from travellers to Madagascar, suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases and contact of confirmed cases. Swabs were tested at the national reference laboratory using real-time RT-PCR. Data collected from patients were entered in an electronic database for subsequent statistical analysis. All distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases were mapped, and six genomes of viruses were fully sequenced., RESULTS: Overall, 26,415 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 18 March and 18 September 2020, of whom 21.0% (5,553/26,145) returned positive. Among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the median age was 39 years (IQR: 28-52), and 56.6% (3,311/5,553) were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The probability of testing positive increased with age with the highest adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 [95% CI: 1.9-2.5] for individuals aged 49 years and more. Viral strains sequenced belong to clades 19A, 20A and 20B indicative of several independent introduction of viruses., CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the first wave of the COVID-19 in Madagascar. Despite early strategies in place Madagascar could not avoid the introduction and spread of the virus. More studies are needed to estimate the true burden of disease and make public health recommendations for a better preparation to another wave. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Prevalence of Otorhinolaryngological Symptoms in Covid 19 Patients. To determine prevelance of ENT symptoms in COVID 19 positive patients. A cross sectional study was performed at SRTR GMC AMBAJOGAI, a tertiary care hospital amongst the patients admitted in COVID 19 isolation ward with a positive RT-PCR report. Amongst the included 180 patients, 112 patients had one or more ENT related symptoms that included throat pain (47.2%), loss of smell (55.5%), loss of taste (58.8%) and hearing loss (54.44%) along with generalized COVID 19 symptoms. ENT symptoms can be considered as biomarkers for early diagnosis of Covid-19 patients ensuring faster treatment and isolation allowing better containment of the disease.

0	"Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the profession and psychological wellbeing of radiologists: a nationwide online survey. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has played havoc within healthcare systems, with radiology sharing a substantial burden. Our purpose is to report findings from a survey on the crisis impact among members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM)., METHODS: All members were invited to a 42-question online survey about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on personal and family life, professional activity, socioeconomic and psychological condition. Participants were classified based on working in the most severely affected Italian regions (""hot regions"") or elsewhere., RESULTS: A total of 2150 radiologists joined the survey. More than 60% of respondents estimated a workload reduction greater than 50%, with a higher prevalence among private workers in hot regions (72.7% vs 66.5% elsewhere, p = 0.1010). Most respondents were concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak could impact the management of non-COVID-19 patients and expected a work overload after the crisis. More than 40% were moderately or severely worried that their professional activity could be damaged, and most residents believed that their training had been affected. More than 50% of respondents had increased emotional stress at work, including moderate or severe symptoms due to sleep disturbances, feeling like living in slow motion and having negative thoughts, those latter being more likely in single-living respondents from hot regions [log OR 0.7108 (CI95% 0.3445 / 1.0770), p = 0.0001]., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a sensible impact on the working and personal life of SIRM members, with more specific criticalities in hot regions. Our findings could aid preserving the radiologists' wellbeing after the crisis."	false
0	Incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with non-invasive respiratory support during COVID-19 outbreak. While the incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients is very high, in patients under non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) is still unknown. The specific incidence of thrombotic events in each of the clinical scenarios within the broad spectrum of severity of COVID-19, is not clearly established, and this has not allowed the implementation of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation for routine care in COVID-19. Patients admitted in a semi-critical unit treated initially with NIS, especially Continuous-Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), were included in the study. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary embolism was analyzed and compared between patients with good response to NIS and patients with clinical deterioration that required orotracheal intubation. 93 patients were included and 16% required mechanical ventilation (MV) after the NIS. The crude cumulative incidence of the PE was 14% (95%, CI 8-22) for all group. In patients that required orotracheal intubation and MV, the cumulative incidence was significantly higher [33% (95%, CI 16-58)] compared to patients that continued with non-invasive support [11% (CI 5-18)] (Log-Rank, p = 0.013). Patients that required mechanical ventilation were at higher risk of PE for a HR of 4.3 (95%CI 1.2-16). In conclusion, cumulative incidence of PE is remarkably higher in critically patients with a potential impact in COVID-19 evolution. In this context, patients under NIS are a very high-risk group for developing PE without a clear strategy regarding thromboprophylaxis. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection in Critically Ill Patients Carries a High Risk of Venous Thrombo-embolism. OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found to cause an increased risk of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its correlation with D dimer levels and pharmacological prophylaxis., METHODS: This was a cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit on the same day of April 2020 were selected, regardless of length of stay, and a single bilateral venous duplex ultrasound in the lower extremities was performed up to 72 hours later. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography angiography. Asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE were registered, including pre-screening in hospital VTE. Characteristics of patients, blood test results, doses of thromboprophylaxis received, VTE events, and mortality after seven day follow up were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 230 critically ill patients were studied. The median intensive care unit stay of these patients was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5 - 19 days). After seven days follow up, the frequency of patients with VTE, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21% - 32%) (69 events in 61 patients): 45 with DVT and 16 with PE (eight of them with concomitant DVT). The cumulative frequency of symptomatic VTE was 8.3% (95% CI 4.7% - 11.8%). D dimer values >= 1 500 ng/mL were diagnostic of VTE, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 42%. During follow up after screening, six patients developed new VTE. Three of them developed a recurrence after a DVT diagnosed at screening, despite receiving therapeutic doses of heparin. Mortality rates at seven day follow up were the same for those with (6.6%) and without (5.3%) VTE., CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 infection are at high risk of VTE, and further new symptomatic VTE events and recurrence can occur despite anticoagulation. The prophylactic anticoagulant dose may need to be increased in patients with a low risk of bleeding. Copyright © 2020 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

0	Clinical features and prognostic factors of patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province, China. Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan and spread in China. Here we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases. We collected and analyzed the clinical data of 172 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 who were diagnosed via qRT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs during January 2020 and February 2020. The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists. The older patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis. The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID-19. Family gatherings were showed among 26.7% of patients. A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases. CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes. The lungs of severe patients are more damaged. Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis. Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 93.0%, and the mortality rate was 2.3%. Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes. The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID-19.	false
0	Recurrent COVID-19 including evidence of reinfection and enhanced severity in thirty Brazilian healthcare workers. BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about individuals reported to suffer repeat COVID-19 disease episodes, these in a small number of cases characterised as de novo infections with distinct sequences, indicative of insufficient protective immunity even in the short term., METHODS: Observational case series and case-control studies reporting 33 cases of recurrent, symptomatic, qRT-PCR positive COVID-19. Recurrent disease was defined as symptomatic recurrence after symptom-free clinical recovery, with release from isolation >14 days from the beginning of symptoms confirmed by qRT-PCR. The case control study-design compared this group of patients with a control group of 62 patients randomly selected from the same COVID-19 database., RESULTS: Of 33 recurrent COVID-19 patients, 26 were female and 30 were HCW. Mean time to recurrence was 50.5 days which was associated with being a HCW (OR 36.4 (p <0.0001)), and blood type A (OR 4.8 (p=0.002)). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were signifcantly lower in recurrent patients after initial COVID-19 (2.4+/-0.610; p<0.0001) and after recurrence (6.4+/-11.34; p=0.007). Virus genome sequencing identified reinfection by a different isolate in one patient., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detailed case series showing COVID-19 recurrence with qRT-PCR positivity. For one individual detection of phylogenetically distinct genomic sequences in the first and second episodes confirmed bona fide renfection, but in most cases the data do not formally distinguish between reinfection and re-emergence of a chronic infection reservoir. These episodes were significantly associated with reduced Ab response during initial disease and argue the need for ongoing vigilance without an assumption of protection after a first episode.

0	Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2 following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with Matrix-M™ vaccination. Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M™. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.	false
0	What Will Happen to Biomedical Research in Low-and-Middle Income Countries in the PostCOVID-19 World?. Scientific research is essential for a nation's development and is vital for generating solutions to population's health. Individual country's capacities to prevent and respond to public health issues, including health crises, is built with long-term investment in highly qualified professionals, infrastructure, and uninterrupted operating funding. Most Latin American countries, especially those at the bottom of the human development list, have limited capacity even though they are hot spots for tropical and other emerging infectious diseases. This weakness deepens these countries' dependence on nations with higher development and corresponding scientific capacity. The current COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the health of the world's population and the global economy. Countries that lagged behind prior to the pandemic now face a myriad of additional challenges. On a more optimistic note, the pandemic could serve as a wake-up call for governments and funding agencies to strengthen scientific capacity around the world, so that we are better prepared to address the public health issues caused by current and prevalent diseases and by future diseases of pandemic potential.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Assessing the regional impact of Japan's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration: a population-level observational study using social networking services. OBJECTIVE: On 7 April 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. To estimate the impact of the declaration on regional cities with low numbers of COVID-19 cases, large-scale surveillance to capture the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 was urgently conducted in this study., DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: Social networking service (SNS)-based online survey conducted in five prefectures of Japan: Tottori, Kagawa, Shimane, Tokushima and Okayama., PARTICIPANTS: 127 121 participants from the five prefectures surveyed between 24 March and 5 May 2020., INTERVENTIONS: An SNS-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was launched. It asks questions regarding postcode, personal information, preventive actions, and current and past symptoms related to COVID-19., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Empirical Bayes estimates of age-sex-standardised incidence rate (EBSIR) of symptoms and the spatial correlation between the number of those who reported having symptoms and the number of COVID-19 cases were examined to identify the geographical distribution of symptoms in the five prefectures., RESULTS: 97.8% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters of fever with significant spatial correlation (r=0.67) with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, especially in the urban centres of prefectural capital cities., CONCLUSIONS: Given that there are still several high-risk areas measured by EBSIR, careful discussion on which areas should be reopened at the end of the state of emergency is urgently required using real-time SNS system to monitor the nationwide epidemic.

0	A measles-vectored COVID-19 vaccine induces long-term immunity and protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice. In light of the expanding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, developing efficient vaccines that can provide sufficient coverage for the world population is a global health priority. The measles virus (MV)-vectored vaccine is an attractive candidate given the measles vaccine’s extensive safety history, well-established manufacturing process, and induction of strong, long-lasting immunity. We developed an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using either the full-length spike (S) or S2 subunit as the antigen. While the S2 antigen failed to induce neutralizing antibodies, the prefusion-stabilized, full-length S (MV-ATU2-SF-2P-dER) construct proved to be an attractive vaccine candidate, eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses against the S antigen while minimizing reactivity to the vector itself. Neutralizing antibody titers remained high three months after homologous prime-boost immunization, and infectious virus was undetectable in all animals after challenge with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus.	false
0	Clinical Stratification of Pregnant COVID-19 Patients based on Severity: A Single Academic Center Experience. Objective ?The aim of this study was to describe baseline characteristics of a cohort of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and determine if these correlate with disease severity and perinatal outcomes. Study Design ?This was a retrospective cohort trial conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas. All pregnant women presented to our medical center, who were screened and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, were included. We stratified our study population in three groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic not requiring oxygen therapy, and patients requiring oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturation >94%. Relevant population characteristics, laboratory data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were abstracted. A p -value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results ?Between March and July 2020, 91 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to our labor and delivery unit. Among these, 61.5% were asymptomatic, 34.1% were symptomatic, and 4.4% required oxygen support. Our population was mainly Hispanic (80.2%), multiparous (76.9%), obese (70.3%), and with a median age of 27 years. Median gestational age at symptom onset or diagnosis was 36 weeks. Significant differences were found between gestational age and disease severity. Maternal characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbid conditions did not appear to influence severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant laboratory findings associated with increasing disease severity included decreasing hemoglobin and white blood cell count, lymphopenia, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ among groups. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing in neonates of mothers with COVID-19. Conclusion ?Pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are predominantly asymptomatic. Patients appear to be at increased risk for more severe infection requiring oxygen support later in pregnancy. Key Points The majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and <1 in 20 require oxygen support. Women in the later stages of pregnancy may be at increased risk for severe infection. Anemia, leukopenia, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin are associated with increasing severity.Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.	false

Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent comorbidities identified in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Areas covered: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. Expert opinion: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	false
0	Liquid-based cytological and immunohistochemical study of nasopharyngeal swab from persons under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Introduction: We describe cytologic and immunohistologic findings in virus transport medium on cases under investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Cytologic findings in cases under investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection from one hundred consecutive nasopharyngeal swab were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry and SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR determination were performed to detect virus. Result(s): No viral inclusions were noted in squamous cells obtained from virus transport medium. Immunohistochemical study with monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein showed positivity in squamous cells. No positivity was present in others cellular components. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 predominantly localizes squamous cells in cytology samples of patients with RT-PCR positive determination of SARSCoV-2. The results of the current study support the notion that the nasopharyngeal region is the anatomical station that SARS-CoV-2 infects first, and the infection can lead to the migration of the virus into the lower airways.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false
0	High Levels of Circulating IL-8 and Soluble IL-2R Are Associated With Prolonged Illness in Patients With Severe COVID-19. Objectives: The coordinated immune response of the host is the key of the successful combat of the body against SARS-CoV-2 infection and is decisive for the development and progression of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the immunological phenotype of patients are associated with duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19., Method: In this single-center study, 69 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively. Immunological parameters including counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of circulating cytokines and cytokine receptors were screened for their association with disease severity, survival and duration of illness of COVID-19., Results: Our data confirmed previous results that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and circulating levels of IL-6 represent prominent biomarker for the prediction of disease severity and survival of COVID-19. However, this study shows for the first time that duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19 is positively associated with serum levels of IL-8 (P=0.004) and soluble IL-2Ralpha (P=0.025)., Conclusion: The significant association of duration of illness with circulating levels of IL-8 and soluble IL-2Ralpha in patients with severe COVID-19 implicates that neutrophils and T cells are involved in the evolution of COVID-19.

0	COVID-19 Higher Mortality in Chinese Regions With Chronic Exposure to Lower Air Quality. We investigated the geographical character of the COVID-19 infection in China and correlated it with satellite- and ground-based measurements of air quality. Controlling for population density, we found more viral infections in those prefectures (U.S. county equivalent) afflicted by high Carbon Monoxide, Formaldehyde, PM 2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. When summarizing the results at a greater administrative level, we found that the 10 provinces (U.S. state equivalent) with the highest rate of mortality by COVID-19, were often the most polluted but not the most densely populated. Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for the incidence of this disease, despite the conventionally apprehended influence of human mobility on disease dynamics from the site of first appearance, Wuhan. The raw correlations reported here should be interpreted in a broader context, accounting for the growing evidence reported by several other studies. These findings warn communities and policymakers on the implications of long-term air pollution exposure as an ecological, multi-scale public health issue.

Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for facilitating proper containment procedures, and a rapid, sensitive antigen assay is a critical step in curbing the pandemic. In this work, we report the use of a high-purity semiconducting (sc) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based field-effect transistor (FET) decorated with specific binding chemistry to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in clinical nasopharyngeal samples. Our SWCNT FET sensors, with functionalization of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody (SAb) and anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody, detected the S antigen (SAg) and N antigen (NAg), reaching a limit of detection of 0.55 fg/mL for SAg and 0.016 fg/mL for NAg in calibration samples. SAb-functionalized FET sensors also exhibited good sensing performance in discriminating positive and negative clinical samples, indicating a proof of principle for use as a rapid COVID-19 antigen diagnostic tool with high analytical sensitivity and specificity at low cost.	false
0	Significant decrease of facial cellulitis admissions during COVID-19 lockdown in France: a multicentric comparative study. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in France during the first wave. An apparent decrease in incidence of cellulitis of odontogenic origin was noticed then. This study aimed to compare the incidence of cellulitis during this extraordinary period with the same period in 2018 and 2019, based on retrospective multicentric data. All maxillofacial surgery departments in French public hospitals were contacted. Responders were asked to include all patients admitted for the surgical drainage of a head and neck abscess of odontogenic origin during the first 2020 lockdown period, and in a similar time frame in 2018 and 2019 (control group), based on screening the French diagnostic and therapeutic classification of medical acts. We report a 44% significant nationwide decrease in the incidence of admissions for cellulitis. There was 187 patients in 2020 for 334 and 333 patients in 2018/2019 respectively. The reasons to explain this finding are hypothetical (organizational reasons leading to earlier management, patients' fear to seek for medical management, usual excess in surgical indications or concomitant decrease of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs delivery). Whatever the explanation, it would be of great interest to find it out in order to improve the prevention of cellulitis.198 words. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.	false
0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of advance care planning services within the veterans administration system in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the outpatient advance care planning (ACP) services provided by veterans hospitals in Taiwan. METHOD(S): This study adopted a retrospective data analysis. We investigated ACP services provided by 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan from 2019 to June 2020. We also conducted a statistical analysis on the ACP services provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. RESULT(S): From 2019 to June 2020, 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan provided ACP services to 2493 individuals. The outpatient ACP services declined significantly after January 2020, decreasing from a national average of 206.2 +/- 29.2 declarants per month to 106.2 +/- 30.8 declarants per month in the 6 months immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (p < 0.001). From the official implementation of the ACP in January 2019 to the end of June 2020, a total of 1126 declarants accepted ACP services at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. When the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent, the declarants who received ACP services were younger (i.e., 60.1 +/- 15.2 vs 65.5 +/- 16.3 years; p < 0.001). After the variables had been adjusted, the changes in the characteristics of the declarants receiving ACP services when the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent were as follows: a significant increase in the percentage of hospital staff receiving ACP services (odds ratio [OR]: 5.460, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.378-12.536); An increase in the percentage of declarants who paid for the ACP services received at their own expense (OR: 3.417, 95% CI: 1.591-7.339); and an increase in the percentage of declarants who received the consultations with three or more people (OR: 2.017, 95% CI: 1.278-3.182). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 severely changed outpatient ACP services provided by hospitals. The results obtained by this study offer valuable insight regarding the provision of outpatient ACP services.Copyright © 2020, the Chinese Medical Association.	false

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide face the challenge of designing tailored measures of epidemic control to provide reliable health protection while allowing societal and economic activity. In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control-among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. Moreover, we allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. We then examine predictions from these models for a variety of scenarios. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a ""trace & isolate"" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a ""trace & isolate"" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific behavioural responses."	false

Here we describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0 a scalable surrogate virus assay, which titrates antibodies that block infection of Vero-ACE2 cells by a luciferase-encoding vesicular stomatitis virus displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (VSV-SARS2-Fluc). Antibody titers, calculated using a standard curve consisting of stepped concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody, correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with titers obtained from a gold-standard PRNT50% assay performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0 was comprehensively validated using data acquired from 242 assay runs performed over seven days by five analysts, utilizing two separate virus lots, and 176 blood samples. Assay performance was acceptable for clinical use in human serum and plasma based on parameters including linearity, dynamic range, limit of blank and limit of detection, dilutional linearity and parallelism, precision, clinical agreement, matrix equivalence, clinical specificity and sensitivity, and robustness. Sufficient VSV-SARS2-Fluc virus reagent has been banked to test 5 million clinical samples. Notably, a significant drop in IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0 neutralizing antibody titers was observed over a six-month period in people recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0 for measuring SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals and those recovering from natural infections. Such monitoring can be used to better understand what levels of neutralizing antibodies are required for protection from SARS-CoV-2, and what booster dosing schedules are needed to sustain vaccine-induced immunity.	false
0	Serum and CSF alpha-synuclein levels do not change in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can associate diverse neurological manifestations. Several studies have provided proof to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. Alpha-synuclein has been described as a native antiviral factor within neurons, and upregulation of this protein can be seen in animals that suffered other neuroinvasive infections. To assess if increased expression of this protein takes place in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms, we analyzed serum total alpha-synuclein levels in three groups: seven COVID-19 patients with myoclonus, Parkinsonism and/or encephalopathy; thirteen age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without neurological involvement and eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We did not find differences among them. In a subset of four patients, the change in serum alpha-synuclein before and after the onset of neurological symptoms was not significant either. Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein levels were also similar between neurological COVID-19 and healthy controls. Overall, these results cannot support the hypothesis of alpha-synuclein upregulation in humans with neurological symptoms in COVID-19. Further research taking into account a larger group of COVID-19 patients including the whole spectrum of neurological manifestations and disease severity is needed.	false
0	Perinatal outcome and possible vertical transmission of coronavirus disease 2019: experience from North India. Background: The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on mother and fetus remain unknown due to a lack of robust evidence from prospective studies., Purpose: This study evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal outcomes and the scope of vertical transmission., Methods: This ambispective observational study enrolled pregnant women with COVID-19 in North India from April 1 to August 31, 2020 to evaluate neonatal outcomes and the risk of vertical transmission., Results: A total of 44 neonates born to 41 COVID-19-positive mothers were evaluated. Among them, 28 (68.3%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered within 7 days of testing positive for COVID-19, 23 (56%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered by cesarean section; 13 (29.5%) newborns hada low birth weight; seven (15.9%) were preterm; and six (13.6%) required neonatal intensive care unit admission, reflecting an increased incidence of cesarean delivery and low birth weight but zero neonatal mortality. Samples of cord blood, placental membrane, vaginal fluid, amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid (in case of cesarean section), and breast milk for COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tested negative in 22 prospective delivery cases. Nasopharyngeal swabs of two newborns tested positive for COVID-19: one at 24 hours and the other on day 4 of life. In the former case, biological samples were not collected as the mother was asymptomatic and her COVID-19 report was available post-delivery; hence, the source of infection remained inconclusive. In the latter case, all samples tested negative, ruling out the possibility of vertical transmission. All neonates remained asymptomatic on follow-up., Conclusion: COVID-19 does not have direct adverse effects on the fetus per se. The possibility of vertical transmission is almost negligible, although results from larger trials are required to confirm our findings.	false
0	High Rates of COVID-19 Infection Among Indigenous Maya at a US Safety-Net Health System in California. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately and negatively affected communities of color in the United States, especially Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations. We report a cluster of COVID-19 cases among the Maya in Alameda County, California, most of whom were misclassified in public health data as nonindigenous Spanish-speaking people. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all COVID-19 tests performed from April 1 through May 31, 2020, at Alameda Health System. A total of 1561 tests from 1533 patients were performed, with an overall test positivity rate of 17.0% (N = 265). We used the language field from the electronic health record to identify 29 patients as speaking an indigenous Mayan language; by medical record review, we identified 52 additional Maya patients. Maya patients had a test positivity rate of 72.8% as compared with 27.1% (P < .001) for nonindigenous Latinx patients and 8.2% (P < .001) for all other patients. In our sample, 39.6% of patients who had a positive test result for COVID-19 were hospitalized, 11.3% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% died of COVID-19. Maya patients had lower rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-Maya patients. We shared our data with the county health department to inform responses for education, testing, and isolation for Maya patients in Alameda County. Ongoing COVID-19 public health efforts should assess the community prevalence of COVID-19 in the Maya community and other indigenous communities and implement interventions that are linguistically and culturally appropriate.	false
0	A Review on Current Diagnostic Techniques for COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: SARS-Cov-2 appeared first in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, and spread all over the world soon after that. Given the infectious nature of the SARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis tools are important to detect the virus. In this review, we discuss the different diagnostic tests that are currently implemented in laboratories and provide a description of various COVID-19 kits., AREAS COVERED: We summarize molecular techniques that target the viral load, serological methods used for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies detection as well as newly developed faster assays for the detection of SARS-COV 2 in various biological samples., EXPERT OPINION: In the light of the widespread of the pandemic, the massive diagnosis of COVID-19, using various detection techniques, appears to be the most effective strategy for monitoring and containing its propagation.	false
0	Possible dulaglutide-associated cholecystitis with safe continuation post cholecystectomy. DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time., PURPOSE: Possible dulaglutide-induced cholecystitis, with successful resumption of dulaglutide after cholecystectomy, is discussed., SUMMARY: A 72-year-old White man was started on dulaglutide for outpatient management of type 2 diabetes, in addition to his existing antihyperglycemic regimen of metformin, glipizide, pioglitazone, and insulin glargine. His glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration improved from 8.2% to 7.2% with the addition of dulaglutide. Furthermore, the use of dulaglutide did not lead to weight loss. After 16 months of treatment with dulaglutide, he presented to the emergency room with nausea, loss of appetite, and progressive sharp, nonradiating right upper quadrant pain. Based on symptom presentation, laboratory workup, and computed tomography scan results, acute cholecystitis was diagnosed. He underwent a cholecystectomy to remove what was found to be a gangrenous gallbladder. Per documented surgical dictation from the cholecystectomy, the gallbladder was removed, but portions of the biliary tree were left intact. The patient was continued on dulaglutide postoperatively without recurrence of bile stones, biliary tree disease, or abdominal symptoms at 8 months after initial cholecystitis incident., CONCLUSION: A male patient with possible dulaglutide-induced cholecystitis was successfully continued on dulaglutide therapy post cholecystectomy without recurrent complications within the biliary tract.

0	Protective Effect of Arbidol Against Pulmonary Fibrosis and Sepsis in Mice. From the perspective of epidemiology, viral immunology and current clinical research, pulmonary fibrosis may become one of the complications of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cytokine storm is a major cause of new coronavirus death. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of antiviral drug arbidol on cytokine storm and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we use a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and a mouse model of fecal dilution-induced sepsis to evaluate the effects of arbidol on pulmonary fibrosis and cytokine storm. The results showed that arbidol significantly reduced the area of pulmonary fibrosis and improved lung function (reduced inspiratory resistance, lung dynamic compliance and forced vital capacity increased). Treatment with arbidol promoted reduced sepsis severity 48 h after sepsis induction, based on weight, murine sepsis score and survival rate. Arbidol observably alleviates inflammatory infiltrates and injury in the lungs and liver. Finally, we also found that arbidol reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 induced by fecal dilution. In conclusion, our results indicate that arbidol can alleviate the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis, and provide some reference for the treatment of cytokine storm and sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19.

0	Hypoalbuminemia and mortality of sepsis from Covid-19 in a hospital in chocope, peru,2020. Introduction: A correlational type investigation was carried out evaluating 145 patients with COVID-19 sepsis. Objective(s): To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is a predictor of mortality and to identify the serum albumin value most frequently related to lethality. Method(s): Patients older than or equal to 18 years seen at Hospital II Chocope during May to August 2020 were included. Patients with oncological pathologies and incomplete medical records were excluded. The documentary analysis technique was used, by reviewing medical records. Result(s): There was a statistically significant association between hypoalbuminemia and mortality (p=0.014), patients with hypoalbuminemia had 3 times the risk of dying. (OR=3.97 95% CI of 1,24-12,74). Likewise, the highest sensitivity and specificity of the test was when the cut-off point for hypoalbuminemia was 1.38 g / dl. Finally, the most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension. Conclusion(s): Hypoalbuminemia can be a predictor of mortality in patients with sepsis due to COVID-19 at the Hospital de Chocope because it has a statistically significant association, with three times the risk of death. The highest sensitivity and specificity was obtained with an albuminemia cutoff of 1.38 g / dL. The most frequent comorbidity in patients with sepsis due to COVID-19 who died was arterial hypertension.Copyright © 2020 Revista de la Facultad de Medicina Humana. All rights reserved.	false
0	INSIGHT: A population-scale COVID-19 testing strategy combining point-of-care diagnosis with centralized high-throughput sequencing. We present INSIGHT [isothermal NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) sequencing-based high-throughput test], a two-stage coronavirus disease 2019 testing strategy, using a barcoded isothermal NASBA reaction. It combines point-of-care diagnosis with next-generation sequencing, aiming to achieve population-scale testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients. It gives results within 1 to 2 hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow readout, while simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes. The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95% limit of detection is <50 copies of viral RNA per reaction. INSIGHT is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based, point-of-care assay and is potentially scalable to the population level.

0	Prevalence of functional limitation in COVID-19 recovered patients using the post COVID-19 functional status scale. Introduction: COVID-19 is an emerging global health pandemic causing tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic symptoms progressing to poor functional status have been reported in a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients worldwide. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of functional limitation in COVID-19 recovered patients using the post-COVID-19 functional status scale. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. COVID-19 recovered patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction negative status were included and assessed using the post-COVID-19 functional status scale. Data entry and analysis was done in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were performed. Result(s): A total of 106 patients were included for the final analysis. More than half of the patients (56.6%) reported having no functional limitation (grade 0), while the prevalence of some degree of functional limitation was observed in 46 (43.4%) patients (grade 1 to 4). Conclusion(s): Some form of functional limitation should be anticipated after COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID-19 functional status scale can be a valuable tool in determining the prevalence of functional limitation in COVID-19 recovered patients in acute health care settings. It can potentially guide in planning rehabilitative measures in post-acute care management of COVID-19 survivors.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.	false
0	A review of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19: A clinical perspective. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread to all around the world in a short period of time. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 mostly could suffer from an abnormal coagulation activation risk with increased venous thrombosis events and a poor clinical course. The reported incidence rates of thrombotic complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients vary between 2.6 and 85% (both in non-critically ill and critically ill patients). The risk of venous thromboembolism is not known in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. There are numerous studies and guidelines for administration of thromboprophylaxis for COVID-19 cases. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients should take pharmacological thromboprophylaxis if there is no contraindication. However, there is no consensus on this issue. In this review, we discussed all these approaches in a critical perspective.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false

0	COVID-19: Update on pathogenesis and treatment strategies. COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) is the most contagious virus, which has been character-ized as a global pandemic by WHO. The pathological cycle of COVID-19 virus can be specified as RNAaemia, severe pneumonia, along with the Ground-glass opacity (GGO), and acute cardiac in-jury. The S protein of Coronavirus has been reported to be involved in the entry of the virus into the host cell, which can be accomplished by direct membrane fusion between the virus and plasma membrane. In the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membrane, the newly formed enveloped glyco-proteins are introduced. The spread of disease occurs due to contact and droplets unleashed by the vesicles holding the virus particles combined with the plasma membrane to the virus released by the host. The present manuscript describes the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and various treatment strategies that include drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, antibodies: SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and plasma treatment facili-tate the therapeutic effect.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.	false
0	Geography of COVID-19 in Denmark. Aim: To investigate the COVID-19 situation across geographical areas of Denmark over time. Method(s): We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Result(s): The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 had affected eastern Denmark, especially the Capital Region, considerably more than western Denmark. The difference may relate to population density and housing conditions.	false
0	Characteristics and Management of Children With COVID-19 in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Turkey. Introduction: Limited data are available for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially with regard to disease management strategies. Objective(s): To assess the children with COVID-19. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients on March 11 and May 23, 2020. Result(s): We evaluated 77 COVID-19 pediatric patients, of whom 45.5% were male, with a median age of 8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-13), and 6.4% had underlying diseases. Patients were classified according to severity, with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and critical/severe cases determined to be 24.7%, 41.6%, 29.9%, and 3.9%, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanic ventilation were only required for 1 patient. Targeted therapies were used in 3 patients. Conclusion(s): The disease course of COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, and the treatment course primarily consists of supportive care.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	The impact of COVID-19 in the management of AL amyloidosis and Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease: A single-center experience. Introduction: Patients with AL amyloidosis and immunoglobulin deposition diseases (IDD) are vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the immune compromise from the plasma cell disorder and therapy-related immune defects. We describe a local experience in providing care for patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD. Method(s): Patient treatment and disease status since the beginning of the pandemic on March 11, 2020, as declared by WHO, were collected and analyzed. Result(s): Ninety-six patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD were included. Four patients with IDD and 22 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis were receiving treatment during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, patients' treatments were discontinued if they achieved VGPR or better postinduction. Seven patients discontinued all treatment after achieving VGPR, and others required treatment modifications. 28 patients have been tested for COVID-19, and all tests have been negative. Three patients died since the pandemic, two from organ complications of systemic AL amyloidosis and one from an unrelated cause. Conclusion(s): The management of AL amyloidosis and IDD must be individualized on the clinical characteristics, centers' access to care under the pandemic restrictions, and the epidemiological aspects of the outbreak.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

0	Assessment of a universal preprocedural screening program for covid-19. Objectives Study objectives were to: (1) Determine the value of a COVID-19 universal preprocedural screening program; and (2) Using the results of asymptomatic positive screens, determine the safety of resuming elective procedures. Design This was a descriptive study detailing the process and findings from implementation of a COVID-19 universal preprocedural screening program. Setting An adult academic tertiary center in Indiana. Patients Patients were included in the analysis if they were screened 96 hours prior to or within 24 hours after undergoing a procedure in the operating room, cardiac catheterization lab, or endoscopy. Methods A report was generated from the electronic health record of patients undergoing procedures from a six week period of time (May 4th-June 14th, 2020). Health records for positive screens were reviewed and classified as symptomatic if they met either criteria: (1) screen performed due to presence of COVID-19 symptoms; (2) documentation of symptoms at the time of the screen. Patients with a positive screen that did not meet symptomatic criteria were classified as asymptomatic. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequencies and percentages for the included sample. Results The initial sample included 2,194 patients, comprised of 46 positive and 2,148 negative screens. Out of the 46 patients who had a positive test, 17 were asymptomatic, resulting in an asymptomatic rate of 0.79% (17/2165). Conclusion Findings validated the value of the program through identification of a low rate of asymptomatic positive screens and procedural team adoption and sustainment. Findings may help inform decision making of like organizations attempting to enhance safety while resuming elective procedures.Copyright © 2021 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

0	Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 by healthy and sick dogs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Infections of animals with SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported, and an increase of severe lung pathologies in domestic dogs has also been detected by veterinarians in Spain. Therefore, further descriptions of the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19 would be highly valuable. The potential for companion animals to contribute to the continued transmission and community spread of this known human-to-human disease is an urgent issue to be considered. Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound analysis, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. An additional twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2-positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by several immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial patterns with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. The forty sick dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that despite detecting dogs with alpha-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we never obtained a positive RT-qPCR for SARS-SoV-2, not even in dogs with severe pulmonary disease; suggesting that even in the case of canine infection, transmission would be unlikely. Moreover, dogs living in COVID-19-positive households could have been more highly exposed to infection with SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Synthesis of polystyrene-based fluorescent quantum dots nanolabel and its performance in H5N1 virus and SARS-CoV-2 antibody sensing. Quantum dots (QDs) based fluorescent nanobeads are considered as promising materials for next generation point-of-care diagnosis systems. In this study, we carried out, for the first time, the synthesis of QDs nanobeads using polystyrene (PS) nanobead as the template. QDs loading on PS nanobead surface in this method can be readily achieved by the use of polyelectrolyte, avoiding the time-consuming and uncontrollable silane reagents-involved functionalization procedure that conventional synthesis of silica-based QDs nanobeads often suffer from. Notably, the application of QDs nanobeads in suspension microarray for H5N1 virus detection leads to a sensitivity lower than 25 PFU/mL. In addition, QDs nanobead was also incorporated into lateral flow assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection, leading to more than one order of magnitude detection sensitivity as compared to that of commercial one based on colloid gold.

0	Comparison of acute pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 and other respiratory viruses in children: a retrospective multi-center cohort study during COVID-19 outbreak. BACKGROUND: Until January 18, 2021, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 93 million individuals and has caused a certain degree of panic. Viral pneumonia caused by common viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses have been more common in children. However, the incidence of COVID-19 in children was significantly lower than that in adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 in children compared with those of other sources of viral pneumonia diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak., METHODS: Children with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia admitted to 20 hospitals were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center cohort study. A total of 64 children with COVID-19 were defined as the COVID-19 cohort, of which 40 children who developed pneumonia were defined as the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort. Another 284 children with pneumonia caused by other viruses were defined as the viral pneumonia cohort. The epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings were compared by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Contingency table method. Drug usage, immunotherapy, blood transfusion, and need for oxygen support were collected as the treatment indexes. Mortality, intensive care needs and symptomatic duration were collected as the outcome indicators., RESULTS: Compared with the viral pneumonia cohort, children in the COVID-19 cohort were mostly exposed to family members confirmed to have COVID-19 (53/64 vs. 23/284), were of older median age (6.3 vs. 3.2 years), and had a higher proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO) on computed tomography (18/40 vs. 0/38, P < 0.001). Children in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort had a lower proportion of severe cases (1/40 vs. 38/284, P = 0.048), and lower cases with high fever (3/40 vs. 167/284, P < 0.001), requiring intensive care (1/40 vs. 32/284, P < 0.047) and with shorter symptomatic duration (median 5 vs. 8 d, P < 0.001). The proportion of cases with evaluated inflammatory indicators, biochemical indicators related to organ or tissue damage, D-dimer and secondary bacterial infection were lower in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort than those in the viral pneumonia cohort (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were found in the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in 25 children with COVID-19 who received antiviral drugs (lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and arbidol) as compared with duration in 39 children without antiviral therapy [median 10 vs. 9 d, P = 0.885]., CONCLUSION: The symptoms and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in children were no more severe than those in children with other viral pneumonia. Lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin and arbidol do not shorten the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in children with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, attention also must be given to children with infection by other pathogens infection.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse events in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors: an observational prospective study. BACKGROUND: In ambulatory patients with cancer with asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the safety of targeted therapies (TTs), chemotherapy (CT) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy is still unknown., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the start of the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Bergamo, Italy, we have prospectively screened all consecutive outpatients who presented for treatment to the Oncology Division of the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo for SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression. We identified patients treated with ICIs and compared these to patients with the same cancer subtypes treated with TTs or CT., RESULTS: Between March 5 and May 18, 293 consecutive patients (49% melanoma, 34% non-small cell lung cancer, 9% renal cell carcinoma, 8% other) were included in this study: 159 (54%), 50 (17%) and 84 (29%) received ICIs, CT or TTs, respectively. Overall 89 patients (30.0%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Mortality of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was statistically significantly higher compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (8/89 vs 3/204, respectively, Fisher's exact test p=0.004). All deaths were due to COVID-19. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative cases (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p=0.0008). The incidence of SAEs in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients was similar in ICI and CT patients (17.3% and 3.7% for positive and negative patients in ICIs and 15.4% and 2.7% in CT, Breslow-Day test p=0.891). No COVID-19-related SAEs were observed in the TTs patients., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAEs was higher for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated with ICIs and CT, mostly in advanced disease. No SAEs were observed in patients treated with TTs. SAEs were COVID-19 related rather than treatment related. Treatment with ICIs does not appear to significantly increase risk of SAEs compared with CT. This information should be considered when determining treatment options for patients.

0	Retrospective study of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain: analysis of counterfactual scenarios. One of the most important questions on the COVID-19 pandemic is ascertaining the correct timing to introduce non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), based mainly on mobility restrictions, to control the rising of the daily incidence in a specific territory. Here, we make a retrospective analysis of the first wave of the epidemic in Spain and provide a set of useful insights to optimize actions in the near future. We have reconstructed the exposure times, from infection to detectability, to correctly estimate the reproduction number R t . This enables us to analyze counterfactual scenarios to understand the impact of earlier or later responses, decoupling containment measures from natural immunity. Our results quantify the differences in the number of fatalities for earlier and later responses to the epidemic in Spain. <h4>Teaser</h4> “We propose a backward analysis of pandemic incidence in a region to determine the correct timing of authorities’ non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight COVID-19”	false
0	Stringent thresholds in SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays lead to under-detection of mild infections. BACKGROUND: Thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays have typically been determined using samples from symptomatic, often hospitalised, patients. In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear., METHODS: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds., RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6-92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9-82.7%)., CONCLUSION: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10-30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results. While lowered diagnostic thresholds may result in unacceptable specificity, our findings have implications for epidemiological analyses and result interpretation in individuals with a high pre-test probability. Samples from mild PCR-confirmed infections should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations.	false
0	"Socio-economic factors do also matter: comments on the article ""Can climatic factors explain the differences in COVID-19 incidence and severity across the spanish regions?: an ecological study"". A report published in this journal showed an inversely significant association between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) before the pandemic and cumulative COVID-19 cases in Spain. The analyses employed several meteorological factors, but socio-economic factors were not included. We examined the associations of COVID-19 cases with selected factors and found a significance on gross domestic product per capita (p = 0.037 by Spearman's correlation). Hence, simple regression analyses of UVR would be confounded with regional difference in economic activities. In addition, we raised several questions for limitations due to the study design and analyses."	false
0	Insufficient social distancing may contribute to COVID-19 outbreak: The case of Ijui city in Brazil. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has given way to a global pandemic. A present COVID-19 has high transmission rates worldwide, including in small Brazilian cities such as Ijui. Located in the northwest part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and with a population of 83,475, Ijui was selected as the site of a population-based survey involving 2,222 subjects, from April to June 2020. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routines (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijui, as well as the mobile social distancing index (MSDI). In this study, we demonstrate that there was a decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijui. Furthermore, we provide predictions for the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the city. We conclude that insufficient social distancing, as evidenced by different methods, may be related to the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijui. Our study predicts an approaching outbreak of COVID-19 in Ijui through community spread, which could be avoided or attenuated with increased levels of social distancing among the population.	false
0	Performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests: Are they good enough?. In the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations. SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n = 43) were analyzed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n = 50), confirmed respiratory infections (n = 50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n = 22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n = 30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen. EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2%-8.1% and 8.2%-9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was 100% (CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at >=14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed good analytical performance. The head-to-head analysis of samples revealed differences in results that may be linked to the use of nucleocapsid or spike proteins. The point of care device tested demonstrated adequate performance for antibody detection.	false

0	Dual-energy CT angiography reveals high prevalence of perfusion defects unrelated to pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 lesions. BACKGROUND: Lung perfusion defects (PDs) have been described in COVID-19 using dual-energy computed tomography pulmonary angiography (DE-CTPA). We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of PDs in COVID-19 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and negative CTPA., METHODS: This retrospective study included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia groups of patients with DE-CTPA negative for PE. Two radiologists rated the presence of PD within the lung opacities and analyzed the type of lung opacities and PD pattern (i.e. homogeneous or heterogeneous). The clinical, biological, radiological characteristics including time from first symptoms and admission to DE-CTPA, oxygen requirements, CRP, D-dimer levels, duration of hospital admission and death were compared within the COVID-19 group between patients with (PD +) or without PD (PD-)., RESULTS: 67 COVID-19 and 79 non-COVID-19 patients were included. PDs were more frequent in the COVID-19 than in the non-COVID-19 group (59.7% and 26.6% respectively, p < 0.001). Patterns of PDs were different, with COVID-19 patients exhibiting heterogenous PDs (38/40, 95%) whereas non-COVID-19 patients showed mostly homogeneous perfusion defects (7/21 heterogeneous PDs, 33%), p < 0.001. In COVID-19 patients, most consolidations (9/10, 90%) exhibited PDs while less than a third of consolidations (19/67, 28%) had PDs in non-COVID-19 patients. D-dimer, oxygen levels and outcome were similar between COVID-19 PD + and PD- patients; however, time between admission and DE-CTPA was longer in PD + patients (median [IQR], 1 [0-7] and 0 [0-2]; p = 0.045)., CONCLUSION: Unlike in bacterial pneumonia, heterogeneous PDs within lung opacities are a frequent feature of COVID-19 pneumonia in PE-suspected patients.	false
0	Gaming Disorder among Medical College Students during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown. Background The frequent lockdown in Nepal during COVID-19 pandemic had brought various kinds of complexities such as stress among college students. This situation had created uncertainty of future academic career of undergraduate students in medical colleges. Some previously published literature showed gaming as a coping mechanism against stress. Objective To assess the gaming behavior of Medical college students during lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted during lockdown period of July to August 2020. A total of 412 college students were enrolled. Online Google forms were shared to all the eligible students through email, viber and messenger with the help of class representative. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS version 20.0. Result The prevalence of gaming disorder was 8.5% among 260 internet gaming users. About 69.2% of the participants reported that their gaming behavior had increased due to stress of COVID-19 pandemic. Gender and spending more time online per day showed significant associations with greater scores on the internet gaming disorder. Conclusion During lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic, the gaming behavior of medical college students has increased.	false
0	Challenges facing users of hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To explore the difficulties and obstacles of hearing-technology users during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study., STUDY SAMPLE: Individuals with permanent hearing loss (n = 278) answered a questionnaire designed to identify potential obstacles caused by using hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the reasons and deleterious effects associated with the devices. Each category reflected challenges in communicating, learning, and working during the pandemic. Different response categories were compared using descriptive and inferential statistics., RESULTS: The duration of daily device usage before the imposed lockdown was significantly higher than that during (Z = -2.01, p < 0.05), potentially attributable to the pandemic-induced difficulties faced by hearing-technology users. Such challenges include the shortage of batteries for hearing devices, limited access to repair or programming services of said devices and accessories, termination of speech therapy sessions, and obstacles to employment and education., CONCLUSIONS: Among audiologists, efficiency and professionalism are required to educate the public and private health sectors regarding the prevalent challenges and their harmful impact on hearing-technology users during the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome these issues, awareness of telepractice and its importance in providing audiological services to hard of hearing individuals should be raised.	false
0	Is Kidney Transplantation From a COVID-19-Positive Deceased Donor Safe for the Recipient?. INTRODUCTION: In recent months, the number of kidney transplants from deceased donors has declined significantly. One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Determining the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHOD: We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID-19-positive deceased donors to 2 dialysis patients 49 and 45 years old. One of them was on hemodialysis for 28 months; the other received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolic acid. No antilymphocyte agents were used for induction therapy., RESULTS: Cold ischemia time was 22 and 21 hours, respectively. One recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8; another had immediate function. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during their hospital stay. No abnormalities on the chest x-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were negative during the period. Both recipients were discharged 5 weeks after surgery with serum creatinine levels of 122 and 91 mcmol/L, respectively., CONCLUSION: Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Quantification of the tradeoff between test sensitivity and test frequency in COVID-19 epidemic - a multi-scale modeling approach. Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 57% to as low as 1.5% half a year into the outbreak and to 3.2% three years into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.	false
0	Cytokine Signature Induced by SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Mouse Model. Although COVID-19 has become a major challenge to global health, there are currently no efficacious agents for effective treatment. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which contributes to most COVID-19 mortalities. Research points to interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a crucial signature of the cytokine storm, and the clinical use of the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab shows potential for treatment of COVID-19 patient. In this study, we challenged wild-type and adenovirus-5/human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing BALB/c mice with a combination of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike-extracellular domain protein. High levels of TNF-alpha and nearly 100 times increased IL-6 were detected at 6 h, but disappeared by 24 h in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following immunostimulant challenge. Lung injury observed by histopathologic changes and magnetic resonance imaging at 24 h indicated that increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 may initiate CSS in the lung, resulting in the continual production of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that TNF-alpha and IL-6 may contribute to the occurrence of CSS in COVID-19. We also investigated multiple monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibitors for neutralizing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19: mAbs against IL-1alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and inhibitors of p38 and JAK partially relieved CSS; mAbs against IL-6, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF, and inhibitors of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and myeloperoxidase somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. This novel murine model opens a biologically safe, time-saving avenue for clarifying the mechanism of CSS/ARDS in COVID-19 and developing new therapeutic drugs.

In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated the structural stability and flexibility of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex. Further, Wortmannin was proposed as a candidate drug to ERBB4 to control SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis through inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent macropinocytosis, MAPK signaling, and NF-kb singling pathways that regulate host cell entry, replication, and modulation of the host immune system.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <h4>Conclusion: </h4> We conclude that CoV drug target “ERBB4” and candidate drug “Wortmannin” provide insights on the possible personalized therapeutics for emerging COVID-19.</ns3:p>	false
0	A Novel Soluble ACE2 Variant with Prolonged Duration of Action Neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Kidney Organoids. BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for approaches to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Administration of soluble ACE2 protein acting as a decoy to bind to SARS-CoV-2 should limit viral uptake mediated by binding to membrane-bound full-length ACE2, and further therapeutic benefit should result from ensuring enzymatic ACE2 activity to affected organs in patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): A short variant of human soluble ACE2 protein consisting of 618 amino acids (hACE2 1-618) was generated and fused with an albumin binding domain (ABD) using an artificial gene encoding ABDCon, with improved albumin binding affinity. Human kidney organoids were used for infectivity studies of SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility to examine the neutralizing effect of these novel ACE2 variants. RESULT(S): Whereas plasma ACE2 activity of the naked ACE2 1-618 and ACE2 1-740 lasted about 8 hours, the ACE2 1-618-ABD resulted in substantial activity at 96 hours, and it was still biologically active 3 days after injection. Human kidney organoids express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and when infected with SARS-CoV-2, our modified long-acting ACE2 variant neutralized infection. CONCLUSION(S): This novel ACE2 1-618-ABD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in human kidney organoids, and its prolonged duration of action should ensure improved efficacy to prevent viral escape and dosing convenience.Copyright © 2021 by the American Society of Nephrology.	false
0	Protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a SARS-CoV-2-specific receptor, in fetal and placental tissues throughout gestation: new insight for perinatal counseling. OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), yet the incidence of perinatal infection is low. We hypothesized that this could be related to low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in the fetoplacental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 at various gestational ages in both placentae and fetal organs from pregnancies not infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD(S): In May 2020, using samples from a registered biobank, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for ACE2 in tissue samples from fetal organs and placentae from five cases of second- or third-trimester medical termination of pregnancy in healthy women (performed between 15 and 38weeks' gestation), as well as a further two placentae, one from a 7-week spontaneous miscarriage in a non-infected woman and one from a symptomatic pregnant woman positive for SARS-CoV-2 delivered by Cesarean section at 34weeks. Samples were paraffin-embedded and organ tissues included kidney, brain, lung, intestinal tract, heart and testis. Matching tissues (kidney, intestinal tract, lung and testis) from autopsies of four 8-year-old children were tested as controls. Tissue sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2, and protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidney, rectum and ileum samples from 15weeks onwards and in the pediatric controls. It was barely detectable in fetal lung samples at 15+5weeks' gestation and not detectable thereafter, and, in the pediatric controls, ACE2 was detectable only in type-2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal or parenchymal tissues or in cardiac tissues. ACE2 was expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast samples, but not in the amnion, from 7weeks onwards. The intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining in the placenta from the symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 woman was similar to that in the non-infected placentae. CONCLUSION(S): Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at the cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring regarding the risk of congenital malformation. Clinical follow-up of infected pregnant women and their children is needed to validate these observations. © 2020 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.	false

0	The successful introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The physical action of handwashing (for a minimum of 20 s) disrupts the lipid barrier of the COVID-19 virus and thus hand hygiene is one of the most important preventative measures to reduce and ultimately stop the spread of it. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated prevalence of occupational dermatoses was 20% for clinical and 7% for nonclinical staff in a population of U.K. healthcare workers (HCWs). Studies during the pandemic have shown an increased prevalence of hand dermatitis (HD) where the risk rises with increasing numbers of episodes of handwashing suggesting a 'dose-response' effect. Studies of occupational HD during the pandemic have largely been survey-based, performed in a posthoc fashion. We established an in-person 'teach and treat' HD clinic for all staff, with two objectives: firstly, to treat occupational HD in a timely fashion, convenient to staff, enabling them to remain at work; secondly, to provide education regarding hand care and HD prevention. A proforma was developed to record the staff member's age, location of work, role and history of eczema. Brief targeted education regarding the regular application of emollient, and more intensive overnight treatment was designed. Two dermatologists staffed the clinic for 1 h, initially daily, reducing to three times a week as demand reduced in an appropriately sized clinical area within the hospital. Personal protective equipment was worn, and social distancing measures adhered to. The proforma was completed by the attendees and examination was performed by the clinician. A Physician Global Assessment score was assigned, followed by delivery of the brief educational intervention. Topical steroid was prescribed if required. In total, 532 staff attended from 26 March to 6 May 2020 (6-week period). The majority were women (81%; n = 432) with a median age of 42.5 years. The majority of staff were ward based (51%; n = 272). Intensive treatment unit and accident and emergency staff represented 15% (n = 82), theatre staff 5% (n = 28) and the remainder outpatient, office-based or other (laboratory, etc.). Nursing staff represented 33% (n = 177) of attendees, doctors 22% (n = 104) and allied health professionals 21% (n = 112). The remainder were porters, administrative staff, scientists and housekeeping. Thirtythree per cent (n = 178) of attendees reported a previous history of eczema. The prevalence of HD was 88% (n = 468), graded as mild in 52% (n = 276), moderate in 26% (n = 139) and severe/very severe in 9% (n = 50). Topical steroids of different potencies were required in 42% (n = 225) of staff: moderate in 49% (n = 111), potent in 44% (n = 100), highly potent in 1.8% (n = 4) and mild in 0.8% (n = 2). A subset of attendees was approached to evaluate the clinic. All (n = 10/10) were very satisfied with the service. Copious informal feedback from colleagues suggests that this intervention was greatly appreciated. Review of the literature indicates that this cohort represents the largest reported number of HCWs evaluated in person for HD during the pandemic.	false
0	An engineered decoy receptor for SARS-CoV-2 broadly binds protein S sequence variants. The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, because of close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find that an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild-type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild-type receptor. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.

0	Clinical performance of the Panbio assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients. Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, numerous serological tests have been developed, including rapid diagnostic tests. This study aims at assessing the clinical performance of the Panbio IgG/IgM COVID-19 test (Abbott), a rapid lateral flow assay for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. One hundred and thirty-eight samples from 95 COVID-19 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were analyzed to assess the clinical sensitivity. Seventy-six pre-COVID-19 samples were used to evaluate the clinical specificity. Two independent and blinded raters determined visually the presence or absence of the IgG, IgM and control lines for each test after 10 and 20 minutes. The sensitivity obtained with samples collected more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms was 95.2% for IgG. IgM were less frequently detected (highest sensitivity of 20.5%). The specificities obtained were 98.7% and 100% and for IgG and IgM respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was better when the reading was performed at 20 minutes than at 10 minutes, whereas the specificity was unchanged. The Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test presents high sensitivities for IgG 14 days since symptom onset but a low sensitivity for IgM. The specificity was excellent for both IgG and IgM.

0	On the Threshold of Release of Confinement in an Epidemic SEIR Model Taking into Account the Protective Effect of Mask. We present a classic SEIR model taking into account the daily movements of individuals in different places. The model also takes into account partial confinement of individuals. This model is coupled with a model of protection against the epidemic by the use of masks. We are studying the effects of combined confinement and protection measures on the dynamics of the epidemic. We consider a constant proportion of asymptomatic people. We assume that symptomatic infected people may change their urban travel behavior due to the disease which causes them to travel less to places where they used to move and to stay at home more often. We present a sensitivity study with respect to the parameters. We show that the combination of the use of masks with almost complete release of confinement makes it possible to avoid the occurrence of a secondary peak of the epidemic. The model predicts that a total release of confinement can be successful for an epidemic of [Formula: see text] if on average a proportion of [Formula: see text] of the population wears masks of [Formula: see text] efficacy. However, if [Formula: see text] of the population remains confined, the same goal can be achieved with a proportion of [Formula: see text] of the population wearing masks with efficacy of the order of [Formula: see text].	false
0	Potent, Novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors Block Viral Replication in Monkey and Human Cell Cultures. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC 50 < 10 µM). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a “BL2 groove” that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.	false
0	Breastfeeding importance and its therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2. During postnatal development, colostrum and breastmilk are sequentially the first sources of nutrition with protein components and bioactive molecules that confer protection and immunostimulatory function to the gut. Caseins, whey proteins, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), mucins, tryptophan, and growth factors are among milk-borne elements that are directly important in the control of mucosa development and protection. Consequently, breastfeeding is associated with the low incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation and with the decrease in respiratory diseases during postnatal period. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin II-converting enzyme (ACE2) on the cell membrane, allowing virus entrance, replication, and host commitment. ACE2 is expressed by different cell types, which include ciliated cells in the lungs and enterocytes in the intestine. Such cells are highly active in metabolism, as they internalize molecules to be processed and used by the organism. The disruption of ACE2 impairs leads to intestinal inflammation and decreased synthesis of serotonin, affecting motility. By reviewing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts in infants, and gut responses to breastfeeding interruption, we suggest that it is important to maintain breastfeeding during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it might be essential to protect newborns from gastrointestinal-associated disorders and relieve disease symptoms.

0	Making sense of spike D614G in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has evolved to adapt to human host and transmission over the past 12 months. One prominent adaptive mutation is the asparagine-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 in the viral spike protein (D614G), which has become dominant in the currently circulating virus strains. Since spike protein determines host ranges, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis through binding to the cellular receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the D614G mutation is hypothesized to enhance viral fitness in human host, leading to increased transmission during the global pandemic. Here we summarize the recent progress on the role of the D614G mutation in viral replication, pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine and therapeutic antibody development. These findings underscore the importance in closely monitoring viral evolution and defining their functions to ensure countermeasure efficacy against newly emerging variants.	false

0	Evaluation of rapid antibody test and chest computed tomography results of COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study. <h4>Background: </h4> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world. Therefore, rapid, simpler, and more accurate diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/ IgG rapid antibody test results in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and their chest computed tomography (CT) data. <h4>Methods:</h4> A total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0 to 7 days from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR and chest CT scan. According to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n=46), and PCR negative group (n=274). <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 320 COVID-19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 9.4%, 3.1%, and 17.8% within one week respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 69.7% of the patients. In the study, it was determined that 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 100 patients with negative chest CT scan had IgM positive and 2 (2.8%) had both IgM/ IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in 1 (0.4%) and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity (n=97) was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS-CoV-2 0 to 7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms. When the RT-PCR is not available, we believe that the combination of immunochromatographic test and chest CT scan can increase diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.	false
0	Viral genetic sequencing identifies staff transmission of COVID-19 is important in a community hospital outbreak. <h4>Background: </h4> Whole-genome sequencing has been used successfully to provide additional information for transmission pathways in infectious spread. We report and interpret genomic sequencing results in clinical context from a large outbreak of COVID-19 with 46 cases across staff and patients in a community hospital in the UK. Methods Following multiple symptomatic cases within a two-week period, all staff and patients were screened by RT-PCR and staff subsequently had serology tests. Findings Thirty staff (25%) and 16 patients (62%) tested positive for COVID-19. Genomic sequencing data showed significant overlap of viral haplotypes in staff who had overlapping shift patterns. Patient haplotypes were more distinct from each other but had overlap with staff haplotypes. Interpretation This study includes clinical and genomic epidemiological detail that demonstrates the value of a combined approach. Viral genetic sequencing has identified that staff transmission of COVID-19 was important in this community hospital outbreak.	false
0	Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients Based on the Results of Nucleic Acid and Specific Antibodies and the Clinical Relevance of Antibody Levels. Combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody testing is often required in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but whether patients with different nucleic acid and antibody results have different laboratory parameters, severities and clinical outcomes, has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Thus, according to different groups of nucleic acid and antibody results, we aimed to investigate the differences in demographic characteristics, and laboratory parameters among the different groups and predict their clinical outcomes. In our study, nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acids and antibodies were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and chemiluminescence, respectively. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 with different severities, were divided into the PCR+Ab+, PCR+Ab-, and PCR-Ab+ groups. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were compared among the three groups. The correlation of antibodies with laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes was also explored, and antibodies were used to predict the timing of nucleic acid conversion. We found that a total of 364 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, a total of 184, 37, and 143 patients were assigned to the PCR+Ab+, PCR+Ab-, and PCR-Ab+ groups, respectively. Compared to patients in the PCR+Ab- or PCR- Ab+ groups, patients in the PCR+Ab+ group presented worse symptoms, more comorbidities, more laboratory abnormalities, and worse clinical outcomes (P < 0.05). In addition, the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA were all significantly correlated with the days of hospitalization, days of PCR turning negative, and multiple laboratory parameters (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, combined IgM, IgA, and IgG predicted the days of PCR turning negative within 1 week. The best performance was achieved when the cut-off values of IgM, IgG, and IgA were 3.2, 1.8 and 0.5, respectively, with a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 82%. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients who were both positive for nucleic acids and antibodies presented with worse clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, and clinical outcomes. The three specific antibodies were positively correlated with clinical outcomes and most laboratory parameters. Furthermore, antibody levels can predict the time of nucleic acid conversion.

0	Increased incidence of chalazion associated with face mask wear during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: To determine whether the incidence of chalazion increased significantly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County following the widespread adoption of face mask wear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter study of two ophthalmology institutions: a private Oculoplastics practice in San Francisco and the Oculoplastics division of the Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. All patients seen during the studied time periods with a diagnosis of chalazion or hordeolum were identified through review of electronic medical records and included in the study. Incidence was determined for each month between January and August 2020, and compared to data from prior years via ANOVA to evaluate for changes after the onset of the pandemic., Results: In San Francisco, the incidence of chalazion rose significantly in June through August of 2020 when compared to the same interval in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In Los Angeles, the rise in chalazion incidence in 2020 was also statistically significant when compared to data from the years 2018 and 2019., Conclusion: Importance: Widespread mask wear does appear to correspond to an increased incidence of chalazion. This risk may be minimized, while still maintaining the protective benefits of mask wear, by taking the proactive measures discussed to decrease mask induced eye dryness and changes in the eyelid microbiome.

A novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, has become one of the most prevalent and severe infectious diseases in human history. Currently, there are only very few vaccines and therapeutic drugs against COVID-19, and their efficacies are yet to be tested. Drug repurposing aims to explore new applications of approved drugs, which can significantly reduce time and cost compared with de novo drug discovery. In this study, we built a virus-drug dataset, which included 34 viruses, 210 drugs, and 437 confirmed related virus-drug pairs from existing literature. Besides, we developed an Indicator Regularized non-negative Matrix Factorization (IRNMF) method, which introduced the indicator matrix and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition into the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. According to the 5-fold cross-validation on the virus-drug dataset, the performance of IRNMF was better than other methods, and its Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) value was 0.8127. Additionally, we analyzed the case on COVID-19 infection, and our results suggested that the IRNMF algorithm could prioritize unknown virus-drug associations.

0	Copan eNAT Transport System to Address Challenges in COVID-19 Diagnostics in Regions with Limited Testing Access. Community-based healthcare clinics and hospital outreach services have the potential to expand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics to rural areas. However, reduced specimen stability during extended transport, the absence of cold chain to centralized laboratories, and biosafety concerns surrounding specimen handling has limited this expansion. In the following study, we evaluated eNAT (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) as an alternative transport system to address the biosafety and stability challenges associated with expanding COVID-19 diagnostics to rural and remote regions. In this study, we demonstrated that high titer severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lysate placed into eNAT medium cannot be propagated in cell culture, supporting viral inactivation. To account for off-site testing in these settings, we assessed the stability of contrived nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens stored for up to 14 days in various transport medium (eNAT, eSwab, viral transport media [VTM], saline and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at 4degreeC, 22-25degreeC, and 35degreeC. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was unaffected by sample storage temperature over the 2 weeks when stored in eNAT or PBS (change in cycle threshold [DELTACT ] <= 1). In contrast, variable stability was observed across test conditions for other transport media. As eNAT can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, it may support COVID-19 diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC). Evaluation of compatibility of eNAT with Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrated equivalent diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to VTM. Taken together, these findings suggest that the implementation of eNAT as a collection device has the potential to expand COVID-19 testing to areas with limited healthcare access.

0	Aortic Arch Thrombus and Pulmonary Embolism in a COVID-19 Patient. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with endothelial inflammation and a hypercoagulable state resulting in both venous and arterial thromboembolic complications. We present a case of COVID-19-associated aortic thrombus in an otherwise healthy patient. Case Report: A 53-year-old woman with no past medical history presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea, fever, and cough. Her pulse oximetry on room air was 84%. She tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chest radiography revealed moderate patchy bilateral airspace opacities. Serology markers for cytokine storm were significantly elevated, with a serum D-dimer level of 8180 ng/mL (normal < 230 ng/mL). Computed tomography of the chest with i.v. contrast was positive for bilateral ground-glass opacities, scattered filling defects within the bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, and a large thrombus was present at the aortic arch. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and successfully treated with unfractionated heparin, alteplase 50 mg, and argatroban 2 mug/kg/min. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Mural aortic thrombus is a rare but serious cause of distal embolism and is typically discovered during an evaluation of cryptogenic arterial embolization to the viscera or extremities. Patients with suspected hypercoagulable states, such as that encountered with COVID-19, should be screened for thromboembolism, and when identified, aggressively anticoagulated.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Aerosol generating procedures in orthopaedics and recommended protective gear. The prime of COVID-19 forced institutions and hospitals to convert operating rooms into intensive care units. Now as the disease prevalence drops and plateaus in several countries, elective surgeries are being slowly resuming. Such that asymptomatic carriers too would approach hospitals for surgical needs. Coronaviruses are understood to transmit both by droplets and aerosols. Orthopaedic surgery requires regular use of high-speed instruments like power drills, oscillating saws and burrs. Several medical procedures are known to create aerosols thereby exposing the surgeon to contract the virus. Adequate know-how and protective means are mandatory to safeguard the surgical team from inevitable exposure.Copyright © 2020 Delhi Orthopedic Association	false
0	Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance, Vaccine Uptake, and Effectiveness at a Time of Cocirculating COVID-19: Protocol for the English Primary Care Sentinel System for 2020-2021. BACKGROUND: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) are commencing their 54th season of collaboration at a time when SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be cocirculating with the usual winter infections., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct surveillance of influenza and other monitored respiratory conditions and to report on vaccine uptake and effectiveness using nationally representative surveillance data extracted from primary care computerized medical records systems. We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research., METHODS: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval., RESULTS: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded. We are implementing a central swab distribution system for patients self-swabbing at home in addition to in-practice sampling. We have converted all our primary care coding to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) coding. Throughout spring and summer 2020, the network has continued to collect specimens in preparation for the winter or for any second wave of COVID-19 cases. We have collected 5404 swabs and detected 623 cases of COVID-19 through extended virological sampling, and 19,341 samples have been collected for serology. This shows our preparedness for the winter season., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a groundswell of general practices joining our network. It has also created a permissive environment in which we have developed the capacity and capability of the national primary care surveillance systems and our unique public health institute, the RCGP and University of Oxford collaboration.

0	Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain isolated from a naive human antibody library. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust antibody responses in some patients, with a majority of the response directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein. Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that naive antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human naive antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/mL in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of naive antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Introduction: COVID-19-associated muscular complications may comprise myalgia, weakness, wasting, and rhabdomyolysis. Skeletal muscle damage in COVID-19 may be due to direct infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, systemic hyper-inflammatory state with cytokine release and homeostatic perturbation, an autoimmune process, or myotoxic drugs. Disclosing the cause of weakness in an individual patient is therefore difficult. Case Description: We report two patients, who survived typical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment and who developed early on myalgia and severe proximal weakness in all four limbs. Laboratory exams revealed elevated serum creatine kinase and markedly increased C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, concurring with a systemic inflammatory response. On admission in neurorehabilitation (4 and 7 weeks after COVID-19 onset, respectively), the patients presented with proximal flaccid tetraparesis and limb-girdle muscle atrophy. Motor nerve conduction studies showed decreased amplitude and prolonged duration of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal distal motor latencies and normal conduction velocities in median and ulnar nerves. Needle electromyography in proximal muscles revealed spontaneous activity in one and myopathic changes in both patients. Discussion: Clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic findings in these patients were unequivocally consistent with myopathy. Interestingly, increased distal CMAP duration has been described in patients with critical illness myopathy (CIM) and reflects slow muscle fiber conduction velocity due to membrane hypo-excitability, possibly induced by inflammatory cytokines. By analogy with CIM, the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related myopathy might also depend on hyperinflammation and metabolic pathways that may affect muscles in a pathophysiological continuum from hypo-excitability to necrosis.

0	How hand and wrist trauma has changed during covid-19 emergency in Italy: Incidence and distribution of acute injuries. What to learn?. Background: the purpose is to gather and analyze the statistical datas of wrist and hand injuries admitted to the Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery and Replantation Hub center of Careggi Hospital, Florence during the first two months of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. The Authors investigated how the drastic changes in daily activities modified the epidemiology of hand trauma lesions. Method(s): The Authors analyzed the characteristics of hand and wrist traumatic disorders during the months of February and March comparing 2019 to 2020. Collected data included age distribution, traumatic etiology, diagnosis and type of surgical procedures. Result(s): The total number of orthopedic and trauma patients significantly decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 (3360 vs 1470). The number of hand and wrist injuries didn't show a significant difference between 2019 and 2020 instead (192 vs 131). The overall number of patients hospitalized and surgically treated at our Operative Unit (OU) was 168 in 2019 and 120 in 2020. Male patients resulted prevalent (60,7 M vs 39,3F/2019; 63,2 M vs 36,8F/2020). In terms of patient age, in 2020 we registered a significant reduction of cases in the 20-35-year-old age group and a significant increase in the 51-65 and 66-80-year-old age groups. Traffic-related, sport-related and fortuitous injuries significantly decreased in 2020, while the number of domestic accidents significantly increased. Analyzing the Hospital Discharge Records (HDR), we found a significant increase in the number of proximal and middle phalanx fractures; no significant differences were found for other kinds of discharge diagnosis. As for the choice of surgical treatment options, no differences were found between 2019 and 2020. Conclusion(s): Even during drastic movement restrictions and the prolonged suspension of work and leisure activities secondary to COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, hand and wrist traumas rate remained almost the same compared to the same period of the previous year. Nevertheless, a significant change in the etiology and patient age was registered. In fact, sport and traffic-related traumas decreased respect to domestic traumas, while the previous prevalent involvement of young adults was surpassed by accidental hand traumas in the elderly and active adults.Copyright © 2020 Delhi Orthopedic Association	false

0	Management of gestational diabetes in women with a concurrent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, experience of a single center in Northern Italy. Objective: In this study we describe the management of women with gestational diabetes (GD) and an ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can further complicate pregnancies, and if the protocol we usually use for GD pregnancies is also applicable to patients who have contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): This is a retrospective study analyzing all pregnant women with GD and concomitant COVID-19 admitted to our institution for antenatal care between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Result(s): Among pregnant women with GD and a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mean age was 32.9 (SD 5.6) years. Two patients (33%) were of white racial origin and four (67%) were of non-white racial origin. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy. Two women were asymptomatic and four were symptomatic. Only two (33.3%) women received treatment with insulin. None of the patients required intensive care or mechanical ventilation. No complications were found among the neonates. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 was not found to worsen the prognosis of patients with GD or of their offspring. Glycemic monitoring, diet therapy, and insulin, when needed, are sufficient for good metabolic control and favorable maternal and fetal outcomes.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics	false
0	Commercialized diagnostic technologies to combat SARS-CoV2: Advantages and disadvantages. The current situation of the Covid-19 pandemic is indicated by a huge number of infections, high lethality, and rapid spread. These circumstances have stopped the activity of almost the entire world, affecting severely the global economy. A rapid diagnosis of the Covid-19 and a generalized testing protocol is essential to fight against the pandemic and to maintain health control in the population. Principal biosensing and diagnostic technologies used to monitor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 are based on specific genomic analysis and rapid immune tests, both with different technology platforms that include advantages and disadvantages. Most of the in vitro diagnosis companies are competing to be the first on validating under different regulations their technology for placing their platforms for Covid-19 detection as fast as possible in this big international market. A comprehensive analysis of the commercialized technologies for the genomic based sensing and the antibody/antigen detection methods devoted to Covid-19 diagnosis is described in this review, which have been detailed and listed under different countries regulations. The effectiveness of the described technologies throughout the different stages of the disease and a critical comparison of the emerging technologies in the market to counterattack this pandemic have been discussed.

0	Antigenic characterization of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 possess three distinct antigens each which are located in peplomer, membrane, and nucleoprotein virion subcomponents. Although specific antigens are associated with similar polypeptides in both viruses, neither shared antigens nor serological cross-reactions have been observed. These findings were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rabbit whole-virus-specific antisera reacted with dissociated homologous virus and each of its subcomponents, whereas antisera monospecific to separate subcomponents (peplomers, membrane, or core) recognized only their respective components. Since neither shared antigens nor serological cross-reactions were seen between the two viruses, the specificity of the assay was similar to that of crossed-immunoelectrophoresis, virus neutralization, and complement fixation assays. However, sensitivity was increased at least 1,000-fold; complement fixation antibody titers of 2,000 corresponded to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers of 3,200,000. Similar results were obtained with human convalescent-phase sera. In addition, the most prevalent human antibodies were found to be directed against virion peplomers. However, specific antibodies to core antigens and lesser amounts to membrane antigens were found in the sera of patients, which showed significant antibody rises when purified virion subcomponents were used as antigens. Importantly, rises and declines in titers of antibody to one virus and its specific antigens were independent from levels of titers of antibody to the other virus.	false
0	On an SE(Is)(Ih)AR epidemic model with combined vaccination and antiviral controls for COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we study the nonnegativity and stability properties of the solutions of a newly proposed extended SEIR epidemic model, the so-called SE(Is)(Ih)AR epidemic model which might be of potential interest in the characterization and control of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution. The proposed model incorporates both asymptomatic infectious and hospitalized infectious subpopulations to the standard infectious subpopulation of the classical SEIR model. In parallel, it also incorporates feedback vaccination and antiviral treatment controls. The exposed subpopulation has three different transitions to the three kinds of infectious subpopulations under eventually different proportionality parameters. The existence of a unique disease-free equilibrium point and a unique endemic one is proved together with the calculation of their explicit components. Their local asymptotic stability properties and the attainability of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated based on the next generation matrix properties, the value of the basic reproduction number, and nonnegativity properties of the solution and its equilibrium states. The reproduction numbers in the presence of one or both controls is linked to the control-free reproduction number to emphasize that such a number decreases with the control gains. We also prove that, depending on the value of the basic reproduction number, only one of them is a global asymptotic attractor and that the solution has no limit cycles.

0	Determinants of vitamin D activation in patients with acute coronary syndromes and its correlation with inflammatory markers. Background and aim: Vitamin D deficiency is a pandemic disorder affecting over 1 billion of subjects worldwide. Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) represents the perpetrator of the several systemic effects of vitamin D, including the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic actions, potentially preventing acute cardiovascular ischemic events. Variability in the transformation of vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D has been suggested to modulate its cardioprotective benefits, however, the determinants of the levels of calcitriol and their impact on the cardiovascular risk have been seldom addressed and were, therefore, the aim of the present study. Methods and Results: A consecutive cohort of patients undergoing coronary angiography for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. The levels of 25 and 1,25(OH)2 D were assessed at admission by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc) and LIAISON XL. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as 25(OH)D < 10 ng/ml, whereas calcitriol deficiency as 1,25(OH)2D < 19.9 pg/ml. We included in our study 228 patients, divided according to median values of 1,25(OH)2D (= 41.5 pg/ml). Lower calcitriol was associated with age (p = 0.005), diabetes (p = 0.013), renal failure (p < 0.0001), use of diuretics (p = 0.007), platelets (p = 0.019), WBC (p = 0.032), 25(0H)D (p = 0,046), higher creatinine (p = 0.011), and worse glycaemic and lipid profile. A total of 53 patients (23.2%) had hypovitaminosis D, whereas 19 (9.1%) displayed calcitriol deficiency (15.1% among patients with hypovitaminosis D and 7.1% among patients with normal Vitamin D levels, p = 0.09). The independent predictors of 1,25(OH)2D above the median were renal failure (OR[95%CI] = 0.242[0.095-0.617], p = 0.003) and level of vitamin D (OR[95%CI] = 1.057[1.018-1.098], p = 0.004). Calcitriol levels, in fact, directly related with the levels of vitamin D (r = 0.175, p = 0.035), whereas an inverse linear relationship was observed with major inflammatory and metabolic markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein: r = -0.14, p = 0.076; uric acid: r = -0.18, p = 0.014; homocysteine: r = -0.19, p = 0.007; fibrinogen: r = -0.138, p = 0.05) and Lp-PLA2 (r = -0.167, p = 0.037), but not for leukocytes. Conclusion(s): The present study shows that among ACS patients, calcitriol deficiency is frequent and can occur even among patients with adequate vitamin D levels. We identified renal failure and vitamin D levels as independent predictors of 1,25(OH)2D deficiency. Furthermore, we found a significant inverse relationship of calcitriol with inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, suggesting a potential more relevant and accurate role of calcitriol, as compared to cholecalciferol, in the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Future trials should certainly investigate the potential role of calcitriol administration in the setting of acute coronary syndromes as much as in other inflammatory disorders, such as the SARS-CoV2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University	false
0	The Weight of Evidence From Electrophysiology, Observational, and Cardiovascular End Point Studies Demonstrates the Safety of Azithromycin. Increased use of azithromycin (AZ) in treating infections associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reports of increased incidence of prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval associated with AZ used with hydroxychloroquine prompted us to review the latest evidence in the literature, present additional analyses of human cardiovascular (CV) electrophysiology studies, and to describe sequential steps in research and development that were undertaken to characterize the benefit-risk profile of AZ. Combined QTc findings from electrocardiograms taken during oral and i.v. pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies of AZ suggest that clinically meaningful QTc prolongation is unlikely. Findings from several observational studies were heterogeneous and not as consistent as results from at least two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The QTc findings presented and observational data from studies with large numbers of events are not consistent with either a proarrhythmic action of AZ or an increase in frequency of CV deaths. Well-powered RCTs do not suggest a presence of increased risk of CV or sudden cardiac death after short-term or protracted periods of AZ usage, even in patients at higher risk from pre-existing coronary disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Covid-19 mortality risk factors in hospitalized patients: A logistic regression model. Introduction: The population is susceptible to COVID-19 and knowing the most predominant characteristics and comorbidities of those affected is essential to diminish its effects. Objective(s): This study analyzed the biological, social and clinical risk factors for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the district of Trujillo, Peru. Method(s): A descriptive type of study was made, with a quantitative approach and a correlational, retrospective, cross-sectional design. Data was obtained from the Ministry of Health's database, with a sample of 64 patients from March to May 2020. Result(s): 85,71% of the total deceased are male, the most predominant occupation is Retired with an 28,57% incidence, and an average age of 64,67 years. When it came to symptoms of deceased patients, respiratory distress represents the highest percentage of incidence with 90,48%, then fever with 80,95%, followed by malaise in general with 57,14% and cough with 52,38%. The signs that indicated the highest percentage in deaths were dyspnea and abnormal pulmonary auscultation with 47,62%, in Comorbidities patients with cardiovascular disease were found in 42,86% and 14,29% with diabetes. The logistic regression model to predict mortality in hospitalized patients allowed the selection of risk factors such as age, sex, cough, shortness of breath and diabetes. Conclusion(s): The model is adequate to establish these factors, since they show that a fairly considerable percentage of explained variation would correctly classify 90,6% of the cases.Copyright © 2021 Universidad Ricardo Palma, Facultad de Medicina Humana.

0	The relationship between (sub)tropical climates and the incidence of COVID-19. This work explores (non)linear associations between relative humidity and temperature and the incidence of COVID-19 among 27 Brazilian state capital cities in (sub)tropical climates, measured daily from summer through winter. Previous works analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, finds stability by striking a certain balance between relative humidity and temperature, which indicates the possibility of surface contact transmission. The question remains whether seasonal changes associated with climatic fluctuations might actively influence virus survival. Correlations between climatic variables and infectivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 were applied by the use of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing LOESS nonparametric model. Tropical climates allow for more frequent outdoor human interaction, making such areas ideal for studies on the natural transmission of the virus. Outcomes revealed an inverse relationship between subtropical and tropical climates for the spread of the novel coronavirus and temperature, suggesting a sensitivity behavior to climates zones. Each 1 degreeC rise of the daily temperature mean correlated with a -11.76% (t = -5.71, p < 0.0001) decrease and a 5.66% (t = 5.68, p < 0.0001) increase in the incidence of COVID-19 for subtropical and tropical climates, respectively.Copyright © 2021 Prata et al.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 mutation 614G creates an elastase cleavage site enhancing its spread in high AAT-deficient regions. SARS-CoV-2 was first reported from China. Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype.

0	Olfactory and taste dysfunctions in COVID-19. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) can be a single and early prominent symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 infection unlike middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS. OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear., RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed the literature on OD and TD during the COVID-19 pandemic analyzing current data on pathogenesis and clinical correlates including prevalence, recovery rates, risk factors, and predictive power. Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic., SUMMARY: Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD. Recognizing inherent limitations of both subjective and objective OD and TD testing enables us better to manage chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, current mechanistic data suggest neurotropism of COVID-19 for olfactory neuro-epithelium and a potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Future studies are needed to explore further the neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	A glimpse into the diverse cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific cellular immune response may prove to be essential for long-term immune protection against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune naïve population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population. <h4>Importance</h4> Facing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders. This study illustrates the needs for assessing anti-viral cellular immunity in addition to antibody response in the general population.	false
0	A Combination Adjuvant for the Induction of Potent Antiviral Immune Responses for a Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Protein Vaccine. Several promising vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have received emergency use authorization in various countries and are being administered to the general population. However, many issues associated with the vaccines and the protection they provide remain unresolved, including the duration of conferred immunity, whether or not sterilizing immunity is imparted, and the degree of cross-variant protection that is achieved with these vaccines. Early evidence has suggested potentially reduced vaccine efficacy towards certain viral variants in circulation. Development of adjuvants compatible with these vaccine platforms that enhance the immune response and guide the adaptive and cellular immune responses towards the types of responses most effective for broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 will likely be pivotal for complete protection. Natural viral infection stimulates strong immune responses through the activation of three main pathways involving Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we developed a combination, intranasal, adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion-based adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). This rationally designed combination adjuvant yielded a synergistic immune response with highly robust humoral and cellular responses towards SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant spike protein S1 subunit antigen. Significantly enhanced virus neutralizing antibody titers were achieved towards both a homologous SARS-CoV-2 virus (IC50 titers of 1:10 4 ) and a mouse-adapted variant containing the N501Y mutation present in the B1.1.7 UK and B.1.351 South Africa variants. Importantly, NE/IVT DI dramatically enhanced the T H 1-biased cellular response, which is expected to provide more durable and tailored cellular immunity while avoiding potential vaccine enhanced pathology previously associated with T H 2-biased responses in some SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines. Our previous work with the NE/IVT DI adjuvant has demonstrated its compatibility with a broad range of antigen types. Thus, this combined adjuvant approach has strong potential for improving the induced immune profile for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates such that better protection against future drift variants and prevention of transmission can be achieved.	false
0	A scaling approach to estimate the age-dependent COVID-19 infection fatality ratio from incomplete data. SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the life of billions of people around the world since the first outbreak was officially declared in China at the beginning of 2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.	false
0	Characteristics of Viral Shedding in Respiratory Samples and Specific Antibodies Production in 564 COVID-19 Patients. Positive nucleic acid (NA) results have been found in recovered and discharged COVID-19 patients, but the proportion is unclear. This study was designed to analyze the recurrent positive rate of NA results after consecutively negative results, and the relationship between the specific antibody production and positive NA rate. According to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, data of inpatients in Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Jan. 28 and Mar. 6, 2020 were collected. A total of 564 COVID-19 patients over 14 years old who received the examinations of NA and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were included. Days of viral shedding and specific antibodies were recorded and assessed. Among NA tests in respiratory samples (throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and flushing fluid in alveoli), the patients with all-negative NA results accounted for 17.20%, those with single-positive results for 46.63%, and those with multiple-positive results for 36.17% respectively. Besides, the recurrent positive NA results after consecutively negative results appeared in 66 patients (11.70%). For multiple-positive patients, median viral shedding duration was 20 days (range: 1 to 57 days). Of the 205 patients who received 2 or more antibody tests, 141 (68.78%) had decreased IgG and IgM concentrations. IgM decreased to normal range in 24 patients, with a median of 44 days from symptom onset. Viral shedding duration was not significantly correlated with gender, age, disease severity, changes in pulmonary imaging, and antibody concentration. It is concluded that antibody level and antibody change had no significant correlation with the positive rate of NA tests and the conversion rate after continuous negative NA tests. In order to reduce the recurrent positive proportion after discharge, 3 or more consecutive negative NA test results with test interval more than 24 h every time are suggested for the discharge or release from quarantine.	false
0	Thyroid Function Analysis in 50 Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Study. Background: Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, it has affected >200 countries, areas, or territories in 6 continents. At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Method(s): Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. Result(s): TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups. Conclusion(s): The changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19.© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.	false

The objective of this research was to investigate programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-3 (TIM-3), and CD39 exhaustion markers in CD8 T cells of new coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Method(s): A total of 44 patients with COVID-19 (17 subjects in a critical group and 27 patients in a non-critical group) and 14 healthy controls, who were admitted to Hospitals in Babol, were recruited to the study. In subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we compared the phenotype of CD8 T lymphocytes, expressing PD-1, TIM-3, or CD39, both alone and in various combinations. Result(s): The findings showed that the percentage of CD8+ cells was significantly lower in patients. Critical and non-critical patients were more likely than healthy controls to have an escalated frequency of CD8+ TIM-3+, CD8+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ CD39+ cells. No significant differences were observed between all groups in the CD8+ PD-1+ cell counts. There was also no difference between three groups regarding the counts of CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+, CD8+ PD-1+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD39+ cells. The counts of non-exhausted cells were significantly lower in critical and non-critical individuals compared to the healthy individuals' value. Conclusion(s): Patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), altered exhausted CD8 T lymphocytes with CD39 and TIM-3 exhaustion markers, which may account the dysregulated immune response found in COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Influence of the covid-19 pandemic on dental emergency admissions in an urgent dental care service in North Italy. A retrospective study was performed to verify if the number of admissions for urgent dental care in the Urgent Dental Care Service of San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy) was directly related to the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Different periods were analyzed: March 25-April 5, 2019 (pre-COVID); March 23-April 3, 2020 (lockdown); June 8-June 19, 2020 (reopening); and November 9-November 20 (second wave). Raw data regarding admissions, diagnoses, and treatments were extracted. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. The survey included 901 admissions, 285 in pre-COVID, 93 during lockdown, 353 in reopening, and 170 in the second wave. In each time period, statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of each kind of diagnoses (X2(3) = 20.33 p = 0.01 for endodontic emergencies, X2(3) = 29.05 p < 0.01 for cellulitis/phlegmon, X2(3) = 28.55 p < 0.01 for periodontal emergencies, Fisher's Exact Test p < 0.01 for trauma, and X2(3) = 59.94 p < 0.01 for all other kinds of diagnosis). A remarkable increase in consultations (+186.36%) and other treatments (+90.63%) occurred during reopening. Tooth extraction was the most frequently delivered treatment, but suffered the largest reduction during lockdown (-79.82%). The COVID-19 pandemic has highly affected dental activity in north Italy, underling the weaknesses of a private dental system in a pandemic scenario.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

0	Lower respiratory tract samples are reliable for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid diagnosis and animal model study. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to impact countries worldwide. At present, inadequate diagnosis and unreliable evaluation systems hinder the implementation and development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Here, we conducted a horizontal and longitudinal study comparing the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different types of samples collected from COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys. We also detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the above clinical and animal model samples to identify a reliable approach for the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results showed that, regardless of clinical symptoms, the highest detection levels of viral nucleic acid were found in sputum and tracheal brush samples, resulting in a high and stable diagnosis rate. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies were not detected in 6.90% of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, integration of nucleic acid detection results from the various sample types did not improve the diagnosis rate. Moreover, dynamic changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral load were more obvious in sputum and tracheal brushes than in nasal and throat swabs. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in sputum and tracheal brushes was the least affected by infection route, disease progression, and individual differences. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection using lower respiratory tract samples alone is reliable for COVID-19 diagnosis and study.	false
0	Nanoparticle-induced inflammation and fibrosis in ex vivo murine precision-cut liver slices and effects of nanoparticle exposure conditions. Chronic exposure and accumulation of persistent nanomaterials by cells have led to safety concerns on potential long-term effects induced by nanoparticles, including chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With this in mind, we used murine precision-cut liver tissue slices to test potential induction of inflammation and onset of fibrosis upon 72 h exposure to different nanomaterials (0-200 microg/ml). Tissue slices were chosen as an advanced ex vivo 3D model to better resemble the complexity of the in vivo tissue environment, with a focus on the liver where most nanomaterials accumulate. Effects on the onset of fibrosis and inflammation were investigated, with particular care in optimizing nanoparticle exposure conditions to tissue. Thus, we compared the effects induced on slices exposed to nanoparticles in the presence of excess free proteins (in situ), or after corona isolation. Slices exposed to daily-refreshed nanoparticle dispersions were used to test additional effects due to ageing of the dispersions. Exposure to amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles in serum-free conditions led to strong inflammation, with stronger effects with daily-refreshed dispersions. Instead, no inflammation was observed when slices were exposed to the same nanoparticles in medium supplemented with serum to allow corona formation. Similarly, no clear signs of inflammation nor of onset of fibrosis were detected after exposure to silica, titania or carboxylated polystyrene in all conditions tested. Overall, these results show that liver slices can be used to test nanoparticle-induced inflammation in real tissue, and that the exposure conditions and ageing of the dispersions can strongly affect tissue responses to nanoparticles.	false
0	CoV3D: A database of high resolution coronavirus protein structures. SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Stereotypic neutralizing VH antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in patients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals. Stereotypic antibody clonotypes exist in healthy individuals and may provide protective immunity against viral infections by neutralization. We observed that 13 of 17 patients with COVID-19 had stereotypic variable heavy chain (VH) antibody clonotypes directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These antibody clonotypes were composed of immunoglobulin heavy variable 3-53 (IGHV3-53) or IGHV3-66 and immunoglobulin heavy joining 6 (IGHJ6) genes. These clonotypes included IgM, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, and IgA2 subtypes and had minimal somatic mutations, which suggested swift class switching after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The different IGHV chains were paired with diverse light chains resulting in binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Human antibodies specific for the RBD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting entry into host cells. We observed that one of these stereotypic neutralizing antibodies could inhibit viral replication in vitro using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that these VH clonotypes existed in 6 of 10 healthy individuals, with IgM isotypes predominating. These findings suggest that stereotypic clonotypes can develop de novo from naive B cells and not from memory B cells established from prior exposure to similar viruses. The expeditious and stereotypic expansion of these clonotypes may have occurred in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 because they were already present.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Naive human B cells can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through recognition of its receptor binding domain. Exposure to a pathogen elicits an adaptive immune response aimed to control and eradicate. This initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.	false
0	Synthetic Messenger RNA-Based Vaccines: from Scorn to Hype. In the race for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the synthetic mRNA format has been shown to be the fastest one and proved to be safe and highly efficient, even at the very low dose of a few microg per injection. The mRNA vaccines are not new: vaccines that are based on attenuated mRNA viruses, such as Mumps, Measles, and Rubella, immunize by delivering their mRNAs into the cells of the vaccinated individual, who produces the viral proteins that then prime the immune response. Synthetic mRNA in liposomes can be seen as a modern, more refined, and thereby a safer version of those live attenuated RNA viruses. The anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (coding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) is the third synthetic RNA therapeutic being approved. It follows the aptamer Macugen R (which neutralizes VEGF) and the siRNA Onpattro R (which destroys the transthyretin-coding mRNA). Remarkably, the 30 microg of mRNA that are contained in the first approved anti-COVID-19 vaccine are sufficient for generating high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in all injected volunteers (including participants over 65 years old). The efficacy and safety data are stunning. The distribution of these vaccines throughout the world will bring a halt to the coronavirus pandemic.	false
0	Predicting the Potential Effect of E484K Mutation on the Binding of 28 Antibodies to the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 by Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Free Energy Calculation. Vaccines and antibody therapeutic are needed to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread since 2020. Experimental studies have shown that the E484K variant may escape the neutralization of antibodies. To explore the potential impact of E484K mutation on the antibody binding affinity, we calculated the binding free energy of 28 antibodies to the wild type and K484 mutant of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We found that 71% of the antibodies show lower binding affinity to the E484K mutant, indicating the highly possible immune escape risk of the mutated virus. Further analysis revealed that the other mutations, e.g. F490 and V483, are also likely to cause immune escape.	false
0	Single-Cell Sequencing and Immune Function Assays of Peripheral Blood Samples Demonstrate Positive Responses of an Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. Background: Safe and effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to halt the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a promising inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoronaVac (developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China) is currently undergoing its clinical trials in several countries and showing good results. We investigated the immune mechanisms underlying CoronaVac from the perspective of single-cell gene expressions and immune function features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: In this controlled study, 13 healthy participants aged 21&ndash;54 years were recruited in the vaccination group and intramuscularly injected with two doses of CoronaVac (3 &mu;g / 0&middot;5 mL per dose, at Day00 and Day28, right after blood sampling), with peripheral blood samples collected at Day00, Day14, Day28, Day35, and Day45 to monitor dynamic changes. As positive control, 12 participants aged 28&ndash;75 years that had recovered from COVID-19 for approximately eight months were recruited in the recovery group with peripheral blood samples collected. Considering the high cost of sequencing, 11 samples from two healthy participants (H1 and H2) with four timepoints (Day00, Day14, Day28, and Day35) and three recovered participants (R1, R2, and R3) with one timepoint (Month8) were randomly chosen for single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The transcriptomics of PBMC and its constituent cells were analyzed as gene expression responses. For samples from all 25 participants, the serum neutralizing antibody titer to live SARS-CoV-2 and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytokine release activity of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells were assayed as immune function responses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the PBMC transcriptomics after vaccination resembled the COVID-19 recovery control more than that before vaccination, which also applied to its constituent cells such as B cells, T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells. Gradual transitions of PBMC transcriptomics were observed from Day14 to Day28 and Day35 in vaccination groups, which finally approached the recovery control. The B cell levels in PBMC increased after each vaccination, while the T cell levels mainly increased within four weeks after the first vaccination and peaked at Day28. The serum neutralizing antibody titer to live SARS-CoV-2 was low within four weeks after the first vaccination, but the second vaccination could induce significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers due to the immune memory. For both vaccinated participants and recovered participants, the upregulated JUN/FOS network and tuned expressions of immunoglobulin fragments such as IGHV3-30 and IGLV2-23 were observed in B cells. By purifying CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells from PBMC and re-stimulating them with CoronaVac&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, five cytokines were significantly released, including Th1 cytokines (IFN-&gamma; and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10). Th1 cytokines were mainly activated at Day14, Day28, and Day35, supporting cellular immune responses at early stages when the serum neutralizing antibody titer was low. Th2 cytokines were mainly activated at Day28, Day35, and Day45, supporting humoral immune responses at later stages, especially after the second vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Two vaccinations of CoronaVac (3 &micro;g per dose, with an interval of 28 days) could make positive gene expression and immune responses in healthy participants, as revealed by single-cell PBMC transcriptomics and immune function assays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: China&rsquo;s National Science and Technology Major Projects for Major New Drugs Innovation and Development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: QG, YH, XM, and SZ are employees of Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China. The other authors declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: This study was approved by the Peking University Biomedical Ethics Committee.	false

0	Analysis of Humoral Immune Responses in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection. Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a pandemic with tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. In the current study, humoral immune responses were characterized in a cohort of 143 patients with COVID-19 from the University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Method(s): SARS-CoV-2-specific-antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Result(s): The severity of COVID-19 increased with age, and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than female patients. Disease severity was correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after polymerase chain reaction conformation of the infection, and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike protein-directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID-19 disease severity seemed to be correlated with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. Conclusion(s): The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition. Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and are a major contributor to neutralizing antibody responses elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.	false
0	Evidence for Strong Mutation Bias toward, and Selection against, U Content in SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Vaccine Design. Large-scale re-engineering of synonymous sites is a promising strategy to generate vaccines either through synthesis of attenuated viruses or via codon-optimized genes in DNA vaccines. Attenuation typically relies on deoptimization of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favored by selection, here, we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias toward U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations include selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Comparison of sixteen serological SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in sixteen clinical laboratories. Serological SARS-CoV-2 assays are needed to support clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. Recently, assays for large-scale detection of total antibodies (total-Ab) and immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M against SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed, but there are limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of these assays. This study was a Danish national collaboration and evaluated fifteen commercial and one in-house anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays in sixteen laboratories. Sensitivity was evaluated using 150 samples from individuals with asymptomatic, mild or moderate COVID-19; nonhospitalized or hospitalized, confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), collected 13-73 days either from symptom onset or from positive NAAT (patients without symptoms). Specificity and cross reactivity were evaluated in samples collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic from >586 blood donors and patients with autoimmune diseases, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infections and acute viral infections. A specificity of >=99% was achieved by all total-Ab and IgG assays except one, Diasorin/LiaisonXL-IgG (97.2%). Sensitivities in descending order were: Wantai/ELISA total-Ab (96.7%), CUH-NOVO/in-house ELISA total-Ab (96.0%), Ortho/Vitros total-Ab (95.3%), YHLO/iFlash-IgG (94.0%), Ortho/Vitros-IgG (93.3%), Siemens/Atellica total-Ab (93.2%), Roche/Elecsys total-Ab (92.7%), Abbott/Architect-IgG (90.0%), Abbott/Alinity-IgG (median 88.0%), Diasorin/LiaisonXL-IgG (median 84.6%), Siemens/Vista total-Ab (81.0%), Euroimmun/ELISA-IgG (78.0%), and Snibe/Maglumi-IgG (median 78.0%). However, confidence intervals overlapped for several assays. The IgM results were variable, with the Wantai/ELISA-IgM showing the highest sensitivity (82.7%) and specificity (99%). The rate of seropositivity increased with time from symptom onset and symptom severity. Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	New onset atrial fibrilation and risk faktors in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: There is limited data concerning the prevalence of arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF), which may develop as a consequence of direct myocardial injury and the inflammatory state existing in COVID-19., METHODS: This single-center study included data concerning 658 COVID-19 patients, who were hospitalized in our institute, between April 20th, 2020 and July 30th, 2020. Demographic data, findings of the imaging studies, and laboratory test results were retrieved from the institutional digital database., RESULTS: New onset AF (NOAF) was identified in 33 patients (5%). Patients who developed AF were older (72.42 +/- 6.10 vs 53.78 +/- 13.80, p < 0.001) and had higher frequencies of hypertension and heart failure compared to patients without NOAF (p < 0.001, for both). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was higher in patients, who developed NOAF, compared to those who did not during hospitalization for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Subjects, who developed NOAF during hospitalization, had a higher leukocyte count, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin levels compared to those without NOAF (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Diffuse lung infiltration was also more frequent in COVID-19 patients, who developed NOAF, during hospitalization (p = 0.015). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT were predictive for NOAF., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NOAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is higher than the general population. Age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT may be used to identify patients at high risk for development of NOAF. Especially among these parameters, the presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT it was the most powerful independent predictor of NOAF development. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on myocardial perfusion imaging for ischemic heart disease. Purpose: We assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for ischemic heart disease during the lockdown imposed by the Italian Government. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI performed between February and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Napoli Federico II. The number and the findings of stress SPECT-MPI studies acquired in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 were also evaluated for direct comparison. Result(s): The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 123) was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) compared with the mean yearly number of procedures performed in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (n = 413). Yet, the percentage of abnormal stress SPECT-MPI studies was similar (P = 0.65) during the pandemic (36%) compared with the mean percentage value of the corresponding period of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (34%). Conclusion(s): The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding months of the previous 3 years. The lack of difference in the prevalence of abnormal SPECT-MPI studies between the two study periods strongly suggests that many patients with potentially abnormal imaging test have been missed during the pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Door-to-Balloon Time for Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention- Results From the Singapore Western STEMI Network. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the outbreak response measures on door-to-balloon time (D2B). This study examined both D2B and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Methods and Results:This was a retrospective study of 303 STEMI patients who presented directly or were transferred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for PPCI from October 2019 to March 2020. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients admitted before (BOR) and during (DOR) the COVID-19 outbreak response. The study outcomes were in-hospital death, D2B, cardiogenic shock and 30-day readmission. For direct presentations, fewer patients in the DOR group achieved D2B time <90 min compared with the BOR group (71.4% vs. 80.9%, P=0.042). This was more apparent after exclusion of non-system delay cases (DOR 81.6% vs. BOR 95.9%, P=0.006). Prevalence of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (9.5% vs. 1.9%, P=0.003) and acute mitral regurgitation (31.6% vs. 17.5%, P=0.006) was higher in the DOR group. Mortality was similar between groups. Multivariable regression showed that longer D2B time was an independent predictor of death (odds ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.011, P=0.029). CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak response have had an adverse effect on PPCI service efficiency. The study reinforces the need to focus efforts on shortening D2B time, while maintaining infection control measures.	false
0	The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID-19: estimation based on a virtual case. Background: Recently, low dose radiotherapy delivered to the whole lung has been proposed as treatment for the pneumonia due to COVID-19. Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease. Method(s): Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy-1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable. Result(s): The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose <=0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID. Conclusion(s): A RT dose <=0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (<=1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses <=0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.	false
0	Liver fibrosis in patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Metabolic diseases are risk factors for severe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which have a close relationship with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)., AIMS: To evaluate the presence of MAFLD and fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 and its association with prognosis., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the presence of liver steatosis was determined by computed tomography scan (CT). Liver fibrosis was assessed using the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS score), and when altered, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) score. Mann-Whitney U, Student's t-test, logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were used., RESULTS: 432 patients were analyzed, finding steatosis in 40.6%. No differences in pulmonary involvement on CT scan, treatment, or number of days between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission were found between patients with and without MAFLD. The presence of liver fibrosis was associated with higher severity scores, higher levels of inflammatory markers, requirement of mechanical ventilation, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and higher mortality than patients without fibrosis., CONCLUSION: The presence of fibrosis rather than the presence of MAFLD is associated with increased risk for mechanical ventilation, development of AKI, and higher mortality in COVID-19 patients.

0	Therapeutics for COVID-19: from computation to practices-where we are, where we are heading to. Abstract: After the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus, the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought us to the time of serious global health catastrophe. Although no proven therapies are identified yet which can offer a definitive treatment of the COVID-19, a series of antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, immunosuppressant drugs have shown clinical benefits based on repurposing theory. However, these studies are made on small number of patients, and, in majority of the cases, have been carried out as nonrandomized trials. As society is running against the time to combat the COVID-19, we present here a comprehensive review dealing with up-to-date information of therapeutics or drug regimens being utilized by physicians to treat COVID-19 patients along with in-depth discussion of mechanism of action of these drugs and their targets. Ongoing vaccine trials, monoclonal antibodies therapy and convalescent plasma treatment are also discussed. Keeping in mind that computational approaches can offer a significant insight to repurposing based drug discovery, an exhaustive discussion of computational modeling studies is performed which can assist target-specific drug discovery.

0	Audit of early use of virtual clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic at a district general hospital and its implications for future practice. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how healthcare is delivered, with an emphasis on using technology to minimize hospital visits. In the dermatology department of a district general hospital, we describe our early experience of replacing faceto-face consultations with video or telephone consultations in response to COVID-19, including facilities for patients to email photographs. Alongside this major change, our patient cohort presents additional challenges with a high incidence of skin cancer, and an elderly population who may be less confident using technology (http://www.ncin.org.uk/skin/laua/at las.html). Data were collected over 43 days during May-July 2020 for nonsurgical appointments. Two hundred and eightyfour appointments were recorded. Average age was 55.5 years (range 0-97). Nineteen (6.7%) appointments did not go ahead; 18 did not answer and one was a prisoner for whom necessary preparations were not arranged. Of these, 13 were rebooked, five were discharged and one was booked for surgery based on photos. Of the appointments that proceeded, 210 (79.2%) used telephone only, 37 (14.0%) used video only, 15 (5.7%) used a combination and three (1.1%) were face to face. Reasons cited for not using video included 55 (25.8%) instances telephone deemed sufficient, 50 (23.5%) patients not ready on video software at appointment time, 38 (17.8%) not internet savvy, eight (3.8%) had not received the instruction letter, six (2.8%) had technical issues, three (1.4%) requested telephone consultation and two (0.9%) requested a face-to-face instruction. In the remaining 51 (23.9%), no reason was documented. For patients aged >= 65 years, 18 of 127 appointments (14.2%) proceeded by video vs. 27 of 155 (17.4%) in those aged <= 65 years. Ninety-seven (36.6%) patients emailed photos beforehand and 48 (18.1%) were asked to provide photos afterwards. One hundred and nineteen (44.9%) virtual consultations avoided hospital visits; 43 patients were discharged and 76 had routine follow-up arranged. The data shows that, despite initial difficulty implementing, virtual clinics provide significant potential for reducing hospital visits. Elderly patients were less likely to achieve successful video calls and may benefit from focused support. It was noted anecdotally that patients receiving preparatory phone calls from administrative staff to explain the software had a higher uptake of video consultations. Going forwards, we plan to reaudit, evaluating the impact of administrative staff routinely contacting patients prior to appointments. In the long term, although virtual consultations cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations, this may become an increasingly utilized option reflecting patient choice.	false
0	Interplay between COVID-19, pollution, and weather features on changes in the incidence of acute coronary syndromes in early 2020. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented change in the apparent epidemiology of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area. Methods and Results: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI cases. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6 months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all p<0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (p<0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (p<0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (p<0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Versus Influenza-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Requiring Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support. No study has compared patients with COVID-19-related refractory ARDS requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) to a relevant and homogenous control population. We aimed to compare the outcomes, the clinical characteristics, and the adverse effects of COVID-19 patients to a retrospective cohort of influenza patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted in the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals between January 2014 and May 2020. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS requiring V-V ECMO infected with either COVID-19 (n=30) or influenza (n=22) were compared. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients. Median age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p=0.62). The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p=0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge, and 3-month survival. COVID-19 patients had a lower SAPS II score (58 [37-64] vs. 68 [52-83]; p=0.039), a higher body mass index (33 [29-38] vs. 30 [26-34] kg/m2; p=0.05), and were cannulated later (median delay between mechanical support and V-V ECMO 6 vs. 3 days, p=0.004) compared with influenza patients. No difference in overall adverse events was observed between COVID-19 and influenza patients (70% vs. 95.5% respectively; p=0.23). Despite differences in clinical presentation before V-V ECMO implantation, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support.Copyright © ASAIO 2020.	false
0	Susceptibility of the patients infected with Sars-Cov2 to oxidative stress and possible interplay with severity of the disease. Several recent reviews have suggested a role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but its interplay with disease severity has not been revealed yet. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between the severity of COVID-19 and oxidative stress parameters. Clinical data of 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital were analyzed and divided into moderate (n = 44) and severe (n = 33) groups based on their clinical condition. Production of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and defense antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione s-transferase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and sulfhydryl) were assessed using the serum samples. The results revealed that severe patients who presented high serum leukocyte count and CRP level stayed for a longer period in the hospital. However, there was no correlation observed between the oxidative stress parameters and degree of COVID-19 severity in the present study. In conclusion, these results indicate that the disease severity may not be a detrimental factor contributing to the changes in the redox profile of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	829 Utility of universal COVID-19 testing in a midwest pregnant population. Objective: Most published data regarding COVID-19 comes from large cities with high incidence of outbreaks. We sought to evaluate the utility of universal COVID-19 testing in a Midwest region with moderate prevalence of COVID-19. Study Design: In April, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center began employing universal screening for COVID-19 for all inpatient obstetrical patients. We performed a prospective cohort from April 2020-September 2020, collecting b demographic and medical data, hospital course and pregnancy outcomes. Number needed to test and positive predictive values of various patient symptoms for having COVID-19 were calculated. Asymptomatic patients were defined as not having: subjective fever/chills, cough, headache, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, absence of taste/smell. Patients were defined as symptomatic if they had one or more of those symptoms. Result(s): 811 patients were tested a total of 955 times. In all instances, the test used was a SARS-COV2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal specimen. The COVID-19 test-positive rate was 71/955 (7.4%) and the overall prevalence of COVID-19 in this population was 63/811 (7.8%). Of the COVID-19 positive patients, 36/63 (57.1%) were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic patients needed to be tested to detect one COVID-19 patient was 19.3. If a patient was symptomatic on presentation with any of the following: headache, subjective fevers/chills, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste/smell; the positive predictive value (PPV) was 34.1% vs only 4.6% for asymptomatic patients. If a patient specifically had shortness of breath, the PPV 62.5% and the number of patients needed to test to diagnose one positive was 1.8 patients. Conclusion(s): In a medium-sized Midwestern city, the overall COVID-19 prevalence amongst pregnant patients was 7.8% with a positive test rate of 7.4%. In patients without symptoms, the number needed to test to identify one positive patient was 19.3, advocating for universal COVID-19 testing due to high prevalence amongst asymptomatic patients.

0	Data-driven analysis of COVID-19 reveals specific severity patterns distinct from the temporal immune response. Key immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection may associate with either adverse immune reactions (severity) or simply an ongoing anti-viral response (temporality); how immune signatures contribute to severe manifestations and/or temporal progression of disease and whether longer disease duration correlates with severity remain unknown. Patient blood was comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays, leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than 5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes, that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression. Herein, we provide interactive network analysis and data visualization tools to facilitate data mining and hypothesis generation for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis.	false
0	Incidental chest computed tomography findings in asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. A multicentre Indian perspective. In December 2019, an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged called COVID-19. A vast number of people affected by this disease are asymptomatic and yet contagious with up to 79% of COVID-19 infections reportedly caused by undocumented infections. Surprisingly, these asymptomatic subjects are also known to quietly harbor pneumonia changes on CT scans. RT-PCR, the definitive test for COVID-19, maybe false negative in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia on CT. Incidental findings highly suspicious of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT chest of asymptomatic patients may increase as the community transmission of the virus rises and isolation restrictions are released. It is advisable to be aware of its appearances and the challenges associated with it.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Biomarkers for central nervous system injury in cerebrospinal fluid are elevated in COVID-19 and associated with neurological symptoms and disease severity. Background and purpose: Neurological symptoms have been frequently reported in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury are reported to be increased in plasma but not extensively studied in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study examined CSF for biomarkers of CNS injury and other pathology in relation to neurological symptoms and disease severity in patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Method(s): Nineteen patients with neurological symptoms and mild to critical COVID-19 were prospectively included. Extensive analysis of CSF, including measurement of biomarkers of CNS injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL] protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAp], and total tau), was performed and compared to neurological features and disease severity. Result(s): Neurological symptoms included altered mental status (42%), headache (42%), and central (21%) and peripheral weakness (32%). Two patients demonstrated minor pleocytosis, and four patients had increased immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Neuronal autoantibody testing using commercial tests was negative in all patients. Increased CSF levels of NfL protein, total tau, and GFAp were seen in 63%, 37%, and 16% of patients, respectively. Increased NfL protein correlated with disease severity, time in intensive care, and level of consciousness. NfL protein in CSF was higher in patients with central neurological symptoms. Conclusion(s): Although limited by the small sample size, our data suggest that levels of NfL protein, GFAp, and total tau in CSF are commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19 with neurological symptoms. This is in contrast to the standard CSF workup where pathological findings are scarce. NfL protein, in particular, is associated with central neurological symptoms and disease severity.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The economic burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): evidence from Iran. This study aimed to estimate both direct medical and indirect costs of treating the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a societal perspective in the patients at a referral hospital in Fars province as well as the economic burden of COVID-19 in Iran in 2020., METHODS: This study is a partial economic evaluation and a cross-sectional cost-description study conducted based on the data of the COVID-19 patients referred to a referral university hospital in Fars province between March and July 2020. The data were collected by examining the patients' records and accounting information systems. The subjects included all the inpatients with COVID-19 (477 individuals) who admitted to the medical centre during the 4 months. Bottom-up costing (also called micro-costing approach), incidence-based and income-based human capital approaches were used as the main methodological features of this study., RESULTS: The direct medical costs were estimated to be 28,240,025,968 Rials ($ 1,791,172) in total with mean cost of 59,203,409 Rials ($ 3755) per person (SD = 4684 $/ 73,855,161 Rials) in which significant part (41%) was that of intensive and general care beds (11,596,217,487 Rials equal to $ 735,510 (M = 24,310,728 Rials or $ 1542, SD = 34,184,949 Rials or $ 2168(. The second to which were the costs of medicines and medical consumables (28%). The mean indirect costs, including income loss due to premature death, economic production loss due to hospitalization and job absenteeism during recovery course were estimated to be 129,870,974 Rials ($ 11,634) per person. Furthermore, the economic burden of the disease in the country for inpatient cases with the definitive diagnosis was 22,688,925,933,095 Rials equal to $ 1,439,083,784., CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the severe status of the disease would bring about the extremely high cost of illness in this case. It is estimated that the high prevalence rate of COVID-19 has been imposing a heavy economic burden on the country and health system directly that may result in rationing or painful cost-control approaches.	false
0	Interpretation of elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in elite soccer players previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Objectives: To clarify the meaning of elevated cardiac troponin in elite soccer athletes previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and screened for cardiovascular involvement in the wake of competitive sport resumption. Method(s): We designed a retrospective cohort study with the collaboration of two Italian Serie A teams. Soccer players from both rosters (58 athletes) were systematically analysed. For every SARS-CoV-2 positive athlete, the Italian Soccer Federation protocol requested full blood tests including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), along with a complete cardiovascular examination. We extended the analysis to SARS-CoV-2 negative athletes. Result(s): A total of 13/58 players (22.4%) suffered from SARS-CoV-2infection: all had a negative cardiovascular examination and 2/13 (15%) showed increased hs-cTnI values (120.8 pg/ml and 72,6 pg/ml, respectively; upper reference level 39.2 pg/ml), which did not track with inflammatory biomarkers. Regarding the 45/58 (77.6%) non infected athletes, a slight increase in hs-cTnI was observed in 2 (4.5%) subjects (values: 61 pg/ml and 75 pg/ml respectively). All hs-cTnI positive athletes (4/58, 7%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), that excluded any cardiac injury. Conclusion(s): In our retrospective study, SARS-CoV-2 infection in elite soccer athletes was not associated to clinical or biomarkers abnormalities. Increased hs-cTnI was rare and not significantly associated with previous SARS-COV2 infection nor with pathological findings at CMR, albeit elevated hs-cTnI was numerically more prevalent in the infected group.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Canakinumab as treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonia: A prospective case-control study. Objectives: Canakinumab is an IL-1beta antibody that neutralises the activity of IL-1beta. This study examined the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia. Design(s): This study aimed to evaluate the reduction in duration of hospitalisation with adequate oxygen status. Forty-eight patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia were asked to participate in the prospective case-control study: 33 patients (cases) signed informed consent and received canakinumab (Cohort 1) and 15 patients (Controls) refused to receive the experimental drug and received institutional standard of care (Cohort 2). Result(s): Hospital discharge within 21 days was seen in 63% of patients in Cohort 1 vs. 0% in Cohort 2 (median 14 vs. 26 days, respectively; p < 0.001). There was significant clinical improvement in ventilation regimes following administration of canakinumab compared with Cohort 2 (Stuart-Maxwell test for paired data, p < 0.001). Patients treated with canakinumab experienced a significant increase in PaO2:FiO2 (p < 0.001) and reduction in lung damage by CT (p = 0.01), along with significant decreases in immune/inflammation markers that were not observed in Cohort 2. Only mild side-effects were seen in patients treated with canakinumab; survival at 60 days was 90.0% (95% CI 71.9-96.7) in patients treated with canakinumab and 73.3% (95% CI 43.6-89.1) for Cohort 2. Conclusion(s): Treatment with canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia rapidly restored normal oxygen status, decreased the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and was associated with earlier hospital discharge and favourable prognosis versus standard of care.Copyright © 2021 The Authors	false
0	Prevalence and risk factors for acute posttraumatic stress disorder during the COVID-19 outbreak. Background: To examine the prevalence of and risk factors for acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method(s): An online anonymous survey was conducted between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey included two self-administered questionnaires: one collected personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent epidemic area contact history, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Result(s): A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSD among the Chinese public one month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), epidemic area contact history (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictors for PTSD. Limitation(s): First, the majority of participants in this study were the general public, with confirmed or suspected patients being a small part. Second, the measurement of PTSD in this study might be vulnerable to selection bias because of an online self-report study, such as participants' recruitment. Third, the prevalence of PTSD in this study was estimated by an online questionnaire rather than a clinical interview. Conclusion(s): The results suggested that some Chinese showed acute PTSD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who had recent epidemic area contact history, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.Copyright © 2021	false

0	System-wide hematopoietic and immune signaling aberrations in COVID-19 revealed by deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a global crisis. To gain systems-level insights into its pathogenesis, we compared the blood proteome and phosphoproteome of ICU patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and healthy control subjects by quantitative mass spectrometry. We find that COVID-19 is marked with hyperactive T cell and B cell signaling, compromised innate immune response, and dysregulated inflammation, coagulation, metabolism, RNA splicing, transcription and translation pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes global reprogramming of the kinome and kinase-substrate network, resulting in defective antiviral defense via the CK2-OPN-IL-12/IFN-I axis, lymphocyte cell death via aberrant JAK/STAT signaling, and inactivation of innate immune cells via inhibitory SIRPA, SIGLEC and SLAM family receptor signaling. Our work identifies CK2, SYK, JAK3, TYK2 and IL-12 as potential targets for immunomodulatory treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides a valuable approach and resource for deciphering the mechanism of pathogen-host interactions.	false
0	COVID-19 and the kidneys, implications and outcomes. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared as a pandemic has affected millions of people and caused unprecedented number of death. The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b-9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources. Risk of AKI and death is also increased among kidney recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2021, Iranian Society of Nephrology. All rights reserved.	false
0	Oestrogen-mediated upregulation of the Mas receptor contributes to sex differences in acute lung injury and lung vascular barrier regulation. Epidemiological data from the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak suggest sex differences in mortality and vulnerability; however, sex-dependent incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial and the sex-dependent mechanisms of endothelial barrier regulation are unknown. In premenopausal women, increased signalling of angiotensin (Ang)(1-7) via the Mas receptor has been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Since stimulation of the Ang(1-7)/Mas axis protects the endothelial barrier in acute lung injury (ALI), we hypothesised that increased Ang(1-7)/Mas signalling may protect females over males in ALI/ARDS.Clinical data were collected from Charite inpatients (Berlin) and sex differences in ALI were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Mas-receptor deficient (Mas-/- ) mice. Endothelial permeability was assessed as weight change in isolated lungs and as transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in vitroIn 734 090 Charite inpatients (2005-2016), ARDS had a higher incidence in men as compared to women. In murine ALI, male WT mice had more lung oedema, protein leaks and histological evidence of injury than female WT mice. Lung weight change in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) was more pronounced in male WT and female Mas-/- mice than in female WT mice, whereas Mas-receptor expression was higher in female WT lungs. Ovariectomy attenuated protection in female WT mice and reduced Mas-receptor expression. Oestrogen increased Mas-receptor expression and attenuated endothelial leakage in response to thrombin in vitro This effect was alleviated by Mas-receptor blockade.Improved lung endothelial barrier function protects female mice from ALI-induced lung oedema. This effect is partially mediated via enhanced Ang(1-7)/Mas signalling as a result of oestrogen-dependent Mas expression.Copyright ©ERS 2021.	false
0	Experiences of participants in a decentralized HIV medication distribution program in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Restrictions on social interaction and mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact long-term HIV care, particularly in areas of high HIV prevalence such as South Africa. Decentralized antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, which allow stable patients to collect ART at community-based pick-up points, have the potential to improve care by decongesting clinics and decreasing barriers to ART access. We aimed to evaluate the experiences of people receiving HIV care through a decentralized program in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We telephoned a random subsample of 604 participants enrolled in a larger prospective cohort study of the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution Program (CCMDD) in urban Kwazulu-Natal. A semi-structured telephone interview included questions about general concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown, and changes in access to HIV care and ART. Result(s): We completed interviews with 280 participants (46%) of whom 66% were female, median age was 37y, and median time of enrollment in the CCMDD program was 6.7 months. The most common concern among participants regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was food running out, cited by 113 (40%) of participants, followed by becoming infected (n = 99; 35%), being unable to work (n = 85, 30%), and money running out (n= 80; 29%). Primary concerns regarding ART pick-up in the future were COVID-19 infection risk (91, 33%), transportation availability (63, 22%), and safety (58, 21%). Twenty (7%) of 278 participants had recently delayed picking up their ART due to COVID-19. Among those with available data, 40 (30% of 143) reported an increase in time to travel to their medication pick-up point, and 71 (49% of 144) reported an increase in wait-times. Conclusion(s): Participants in a decentralized ART program in South Africa identified socioeconomic concerns and fear of COVID-19 infection during the national lockdown for COVID-19 mitigation. While a small number had delayed picking up ART due to COVID-19, a significant proportion had concerns about accessibility and safety of medication pick-up going forward, and many reported new barriers to picking up their medication. Strategies for maintaining access to longitudinal HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa are needed.	false
0	Pandemic Blood Donor Demographics - Do Changes Impact Blood Safety?. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 safety measures and possibly, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, may alter blood donor demography, which has the potential to alter blood safety. We characterized pre-pandemic and pandemic rates of donor infectious disease marker (IDM) reactivity which reflect the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) undetectable by current testing., METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations in a large national US blood collector identifies changes in self-reported behavioral risk factors and IDM reactivity. Data on allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations from March 1 through August 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019 were retrieved from the blood center's computer system. Donor demographics and deferrals for reported behavioral risk factors and confirmed-positive IDMs were compared in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods., RESULTS: With increasing mobile blood drive cancellations, pandemic donors were more likely than 2019 donors to be female, over age 30, non-Hispanic Whites, and have a post-secondary degree. First-time donations (at highest risk for confirmed-positive IDMs) did not substantially increase. Pandemic donors reported fewer behavioral risks and IDMs declined among these donors. Mid-pandemic introduction of screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not affect IDM rates., CONCLUSIONS: Unlike disasters, which tend to bring out more first-time donors with increased IDM reactivity and TTI residual risk, COVID-19 donors had lower IDM rates which were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

A rapid, accurate, and sensitive analytical method, ultrasonication-assisted spraying based fine droplet formation-liquid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (UA-SFDF-LPME-GC-MS), was proposed for the determination of trace amounts of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in human serum, urine, and saliva samples. To determine the best extraction strategy, several liquid and solid phase extraction methods were investigated for their efficiencies in isolation and preconcentration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from biological matrices. The UA-SFDF-LPME method was determined to be the best extraction method as it was operationally simple and provided accurate results. Variables such as the extraction solvent, spraying number, sodium hydroxide concentration and volume, sample volume, mixing method, and mixing period were optimized for the proposed method using the one-variable-at-a-time approach. In addition, Tukey's method based on a post hoc comparison test was employed to evaluate the significant difference between the parameters inspected. After the optimization studies, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined to be 0.7 and 2.4 mug/kg, respectively. The sensitivity of the GC-MS system based on the LOD was enhanced approximately 440-fold when the UA-SFDF-LPME method was employed. Spiking experiments were also conducted for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples to determine the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Recoveries for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples were found to be in the ranges 94%-102%, 95%-105%, and 93%-102%, respectively. These results were satisfactory and indicated that the hydroxychloroquine sulfate level in the above biological samples could be analyzed using the proposed method. Copyright .	false
0	St Andrew's COVID-19 surgery safety (StACS) study: The Burns Centre experience. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to significantly impact burns patients both directly through infective complications of an immunocompromised cohort, and indirectly through disruption of care pathways and resource limitations. The pandemic presents new challenges that must be overcome to maintain patient safety; in particular, the potential increased risks of surgical intervention, anaesthesia and ventilation. This study comprehensively reviews the measures implemented to adapt referral pathways and mitigate the risk posed by COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic, within a large Burns Centre. Method(s): A prospective cohort study was designed to assess patients treated at the Burns Centre during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020), following implementation of new safety measures. All patients were analysed for 30-day mortality. In addition, a prospective controlled cohort study was undertaken on all inpatients and a random sample of outpatients with telephone follow-up at 30 days. These patients were divided into three groups (operative inpatients, non-operative inpatients, outpatients). COVID-19 related data collected included test results, contact with proven cases, isolation status and symptoms. The implemented departmental service COVID-19 safety adaptations are described. Result(s): Of 323 patients treated at the Burns Centre during the study period, no 30-day COVID-19 related deaths occurred (0/323). Of the 80 patients analysed in the prospective controlled cohort section of the study, 51 underwent COVID-19 testing, 3.9% (2/51) were positive. Both cases were in the operative group, however in comparison to the non-operative and outpatient groups, there was no significant increase in COVID-19 incidence in operative patients. Conclusion(s): We found no COVID-19 related mortality during the study period. With appropriate precautions, burns patients were not exposed to an increased COVID-19 risk. Similarly, burns patients undergoing operative management were not at a significantly increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in comparison to non-operative groups.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI	false
0	905 Utility of COVID-19 universal screening protocol for pregnant patients: review of maternal characteristics and outcomes. Objective: The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on pregnancy is relatively limited with even more ambiguity surrounding the efficacy of screening protocols. This study aims to describe the findings from a COVID-19 universal screening protocol for pregnant patients. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study was performed via chart review during universal screening, April 7, 2020 to September 21, 2020, at the University of California Irvine Labor and Delivery unit. Health informatics software identified patients meeting inclusion criteria: pregnant, age 18 or older, and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. Positive patients were stratified based on presence (symptomatic) or absence of (asymptomatic) COVID-19 symptoms. Study outcomes include screen positive rate, baseline characteristics, abnormal vitals/clinical exam, and perinatal outcomes. Parametric, non-parametric, and Fischer exact tests performed as appropriate for continuous and categorical variables, respectively; significance defined as p < 0.05. Result(s): 7% (42/595) of pregnant patients screened positive with universal screening. Symptomatic patients (26% [11/42]) had a statistically significant association with abnormal vital signs at time of evaluation (p < 0.01) and need for supplemental oxygen (p < 0.001). In contrast, asymptomatic patients (74% [31/42]) were associated with developing abnormal vitals during admission (p < 0.001) and being admitted for a labor indication (p < 0.008). Baseline patient characteristics presented in Table 1 with remaining outcomes in Table 2. Conclusion(s): Under the advent of universal screening for COVID-19, our data suggests that patients' symptoms may offer insight to their level of acuity. While most asymptomatic patients do not have abnormal findings on presentation, our data supports the possible development of abnormal vital signs within days. This information is important for providers and is critical for counseling patients on potential future risks. The inclusion of pregnant women in further research is essential to accurately understand the public health implications of universal screening protocols for COVID-19.

0	The Neutralizing Antibody Response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and the Cytokine/Chemokine Release in Patients with Different Levels of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 Severity: Cytokine Storm Still Persists Despite Viral Disappearanc. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit a wide clinical spectrum ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to critical and fatal diseases, and older individuals are known to be more severely affected. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. A neutralizing antibody against viruses is known to be important to eliminate the virus. In addition, this antibody is induced at high levels in patients with severe COVID-19, followed by a termination of virus replication. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit high levels of cytokines/chemokines, even after the disappearance of the virus. This indicates that cytokines/chemokines play significant roles in disease severity. These findings also suggest that antiviral therapy (monoclonal antibody and/or convalescent plasma therapy) should be administered early to eliminate the virus, followed by steroid treatment after viral genome disappearance, especially in patients with severe symptoms.

0	Simultaneous quantification of seven repurposed COVID-19 drugs remdesivir (plus metabolite GS-441524), chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin by a two-dimensional isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method in human serum. Background: The present COVID-19 pandemic has prompted worldwide repurposing of drugs. The aim of the present work was to develop and validate a two-dimensional isotope-dilution liquid chromatrography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) method for accurate quantification of remdesivir and its active metabolite GS-441524, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in serum; drugs that have gained attention for repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19. Method(s): Following protein precipitation, samples were separated with a two-dimensional ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (2D-UHPLC) setup, consisting of an online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to an analytical column. For quantification, stable isotope-labelled analogues were used as internal standards for all analytes. The method was validated on the basis of the European Medicines Agency bioanalytical method validation protocol. Result(s): Detuning of lopinavir and ritonavir allowed simultaneous quantification of all analytes with different concentration ranges and sensitivity with a uniform injection volume of 5 muL. The method provided robust validation results with inaccuracy and imprecision values of <= 9.59 % and <= 11.1 % for all quality controls. Conclusion(s): The presented method is suitable for accurate and simultaneous quantification of remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441525, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in human serum. The quantitative assay may be an efficient tool for the therapeutic drug monitoring of these potential drug candidates in COVID-19 patients in order to increase treatment efficacy and safety.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	An integrated rural health system baseline assessment of COVID-19 preparedness in Siaya Kenya. <h4>Objective</h4> Our aim was to assess Siaya county COVID-19 preparedness at community and health facility levels and measure baseline household prevalences of fever and cough. <h4>Design</h4> There was retrospective and prospective data collection using standard tools. We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities. <h4>Setting</h4> Siaya in rural Western Kenya <h4>Participants</h4> households and health facilities in Siaya <h4>Results</h4> We visited 19’474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Household prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps. <h4>Strengths and limitations</h4> This study provides an example of how to successfully carry out an integrated rural health system baseline assessment of COVID-19 preparedness; an approach that would be useful for any country experiencing COVID-19 with a significant rural population. Some of our data were retrospective in nature and therefore vulnerable to multiple sources of bias including: recall bias and misclassification. <h4>Clinical Trial registration</h4> Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04501458 5/8/2020 <h4>Protocol</h4> The full protocol has been accepted for publication: Kaseje N, Kaseje D, Oruenjo K, Milambo J and Kaseje M: Engaging community health workers, technology, and youth in the COVID-19 response with concurrent critical care capacity building: A protocol for an integrated community and health system intervention to reduce mortality related to COVID-19 infection in Western Kenya.

0	The effect of COVID-19 on blood donation habits. BACKGROUND: Blood centers (BCs) rely on schools and businesses. Shelter-in-place orders closed them. This study determined how COVID-19 affected donation habits., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two periods were reviewed (May 1 through June 30, 2018 vs 2019 [control] and 2019 vs 2020 [study-COVID period]). These donations were reviewed: first-time, repeat (donation <= 2 years), and lapsed (no donation > 2 years); sex; age; ethnicity; and ABO blood groups at high school and college drives. Testing all donors for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies started May 18, 2020., RESULTS: In the study period donations significantly increased (control P = .683, study P <= .0001) and comparing sex (control male P = .716, female P = .657; study male P = .004, female P <= .0001). In the study period there was a significant decrease in Hispanic (P = .001) and African American (P < .0001) donations also seen among high school and college drives and an increase in Caucasian (P < .0001) donations. There was a significant increase in first-time (P < .0001) and lapsed donors (P < .0001) in the study period vs control (first-time P = .087, lapsed P = .308) and a significant decrease in donors not more than 30 years (study 16-20 P < .0001, 21-30 P < .0001). There was a significant increase in all blood types in the study period (P < .0001) and in donations after implementation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing (P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes occurred in donation habits in the study vs the control periods. These included increased total donations, comparing sexes, first-time and lapsed donors, all blood types, and Caucasian donations. Significant decreases were seen in Hispanic and African American donations and those not more than 30 years old. Copyright © 2021 AABB.	false
0	Breathlessness and cough in the acute setting. The symptom of breathlessness is well recognized as part of the presentation of a wide range of medical conditions. It can be a manifestation of a life-threatening emergency. In acute medical settings, the priority is to quickly recognize patients who are critically unwell and require emergency treatment. For these patients, rapid initial assessment and immediate treatment are essential. However, once symptoms have stabilized or in less acute settings, a more thorough assessment is required. Cough is a common respiratory symptom, often part of a symptom complex, which is troublesome for the patient. It is important to recognize worrying associated features to prompt further investigation. In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged from a zoonotic source, resulting in many cases of infection, hospitalizations and deaths, and has since spread in a pandemic across every continent. A substantial percentage of patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory illness requiring hospital care. Cough and acute breathlessness are two of the most prevalent symptoms in this infection; any patient presenting to an acute setting should currently be assumed to have this infection and immediately tested with a viral swab from the upper airway to guide management.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with inborn errors of immunity: An international study. Background: There is uncertainty about the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in individuals with rare inborn errors of immunity (IEI), a population at risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019. This is relevant not only for these patients but also for the general population, because studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host defense. Objective(s): We sought to describe the presentation, manifestations, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical, and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. Result(s): We gathered information on 94 patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their median age was 25 to 34 years. Fifty-three patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) an autoinflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required noninvasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 required invasive ventilation, and 3 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (7 adults and 2 children) died. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that (1) more than 30% of patients with IEI had mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect patients with IEI, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are nonredundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Emergency medical services evaluations for chest pain during first COVID-19 lockdown in Hollands-Midden, the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had negative indirect health effects, as people seem to have been reluctant to seek medical care., METHODS: All emergency medical services (EMS) transports for chest pain or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the Dutch region Hollands-Midden (population served >800,000) were evaluated during the initial 6 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown and during the same time period in 2019. The primary endpoint was the number of evaluated chest pain patients in both cohorts. In addition, the number of EMS evaluations of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and OHCA were assessed., RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the EMS evaluated 927 chest pain patients (49% male, age 62+/- 17 years) compared with 1041 patients (51% male, 63+/- 17 years) in the same period in 2019, which corresponded with a significant relative risk (RR) reduction of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the number of STEMI patients (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.85), the incidence of OHCA remained unchanged (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83-1.83)., CONCLUSION: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with chest pain or STEMI evaluated by the EMS, while the incidence of OHCA remained similar. Although the reason for the decrease in chest pain and STEMI consultations is not entirely clear, more attention should be paid to the importance of contacting the EMS in case of suspected cardiac symptoms in possible future lockdowns.	false
0	Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Confirmed and Negative Kawasaki Disease Patients During the Pandemic in Spain. Introduction: COVID-19 has a less severe course in children. In April 2020, some children presented with signs of multisystem inflammation with clinical signs overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD), most of them requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This study aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of KD SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and negative patients during the pandemic in Spain. Material and Methods: Medical data of KD patients from January 1, 2018 until May 30, 2020 was collected from the KAWA-RACE study group. We compared the KD cases diagnosed during the COVID-19 period (March 1-May 30, 2020) that were either SARS-CoV-2 confirmed (CoV+) or negative (CoV-) to those from the same period during 2018 and 2019 (PreCoV). Results: One hundred and twenty-four cases were collected. There was a significant increase in cases and PICU admissions in 2020 (P-trend = 0.001 and 0.0004, respectively). CoV+ patients were significantly older (7.5 vs. 2.5 yr) and mainly non-Caucasian (64 vs. 29%), had incomplete KD presentation (73 vs. 32%), lower leucocyte (9.5 vs. 15.5 x 10(9)) and platelet count (174 vs. 423 x 10(9)/L), higher inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein 18.5vs. 10.9 mg/dl) and terminal segment of the natriuretic atrial peptide (4,766 vs. 505 pg/ml), less aneurysm development (3.8 vs. 11.1%), and more myocardial dysfunction (30.8 vs. 1.6%) than PreCoV patients. Respiratory symptoms were not increased during the COVID-19 period. Conclusion: The KD CoV+ patients mostly meet pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19/multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children criteria. Whether this is a novel entity or the same disease on different ends of the spectrum is yet to be clarified.	false
0	The Relationship Between Social Vulnerability and COVID-19 Incidence Among Louisiana Census Tracts. Objective: To examine the association between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and COVID-19 incidence among Louisiana census tracts. Methods: An ecological study comparing the CDC SVI and census tract-level COVID-19 case counts was conducted. Choropleth maps were used to identify census tracts with high levels of both social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence. Negative binomial regression with random intercepts was used to compare the relationship between overall CDC SVI percentile and its four sub-themes and COVID-19 incidence, adjusting for population density. Results: In a crude stratified analysis, all four CDC SVI sub-themes were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. Census tracts with higher levels of social vulnerability were associated with higher COVID-19 incidence after adjusting for population density (adjusted RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.41-1.65). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that increased social vulnerability is linked with COVID-19 incidence. Additional resources should be allocated to areas of increased social disadvantage to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations.	false
0	The SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Real-Time Training and Service for Preventive Medicine Residents. The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created a unique opportunity for Public Health/General Preventive Medicine (PH/GPM) and Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OM) residents to contribute to pandemic public health response activities. We surveyed all 18 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded PH/GPM and OM residency program directors to evaluate program and resident involvement in pandemic response activities from January 1 through June 30, 2020. Of 116 residents, 110 (95%) participated at some level in the response activities including screening/testing, contact tracing, surveillance, data analysis, incident command, provider support, reopening, direct patient care, education, and risk communication. Residents' response activities were in multiple settings, such as state, local, and federal health agencies; hospital systems; long-term care facilities; academic centers; local businesses and labor unions; Federally Qualified Health Centers; homeless shelters; and clinics. Residents' participation was facilitated by their training in public health, epidemiology, the care of patients and populations, and emergency preparedness. Programs should continue to promote these experiences and key roles that PH/GPM and OM residents can play, as this leadership is a necessity for the successful navigation of future major public health events. As the pandemic continues, evaluation of residents' experiences will help guide longer-term changes to program curriculum and partnerships. Many trainees' contributions and expertise met both educational and service goals and therefore should be integrated into ongoing pandemic response work in PH/GPM and OM programs.

0	An Evaluation of Serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Levels in Patients with COVID-19 in New York City. AIM: Deterioration of patients from COVID-19 is associated with cytokine release syndrome attributed to an elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D reduces proinflammatory cytokines, and has the possibility of reducing complications from respiratory tract illnesses., METHOD: This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with COVID-19 disease within a New York City Health System. Adult patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level (25(OH)D) within the three previous months prior to their detected SARS-CoV-2 test. Patients were compared and evaluated based upon their 25(OH)D levels. The primary endpoints were hospitalization, need for oxygen support, and 90-day mortality., RESULTS: 437 COVID-19 patients were included [67 (IQR: 56-79) years] within this cohort. Deficient plasma 25(OH)D levels (<20 ng/ml) were associated with an increased likelihood of oxygen support [OR:2.23 (95% CI: 1.46-3.44, p = 0.0002)] from COVID-19. Deficient plasma 25(OH)D levels were not independently associated with 90-day mortality or risk of hospitalization. Hospitalization rates (98%), oxygen support (93%), and mortality rates (49%) were highest in patients who had 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/ml when compared to other 25(OH)D levels., CONCLUSION: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels may affect the need for oxygen support therapy in patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Mobile Remote Monitoring of Intimate Partner Violence Among Pregnant Patients During the COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place Order: Quality Improvement Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related death. Prenatal health care providers can offer critical screening and support to pregnant people who experience IPV. During the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order, mobile apps may offer such people the opportunity to continue receiving screening and support services., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine cases of IPV that were reported on a prenatal care app before and during the implementation of COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates., METHODS: The number of patients who underwent voluntary IPV screening and the incidence rate of IPV were determined by using a prenatal care app that was disseminated to patients from a single, large health care system. We compared the IPV screening frequencies and IPV incidence rates of patients who started using the app before the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order, to those of patients who started using the app during the shelter-in-place order., RESULTS: We found 552 patients who started using the app within 60 days prior to the enforcement of the shelter-in-place order, and 407 patients who used the app at the start of shelter-in-place enforcement until the order was lifted. The incidence rates of voluntary IPV screening for new app users during the two time periods were similar (before sheltering in place: 252/552, 46%; during sheltering in place: 163/407, 40%). The overall use of the IPV screening tool increased during the shelter-in-place order. A slight, nonsignificant increase in the incidence of physical, sexual, and psychological violence during the shelter-in-place order was found across all app users (P=.56). Notably, none of the patients who screened positively for IPV had mentions of IPV in their medical charts., CONCLUSIONS: App-based screening for IPV is feasible during times when in-person access to health care providers is limited. Our results suggest that the incidence of IPV slightly increased during the shelter-in-place order. App-based screening may also address the needs of those who are unwilling or unable to share their IPV experiences with their health care provider.

0	The right to health, public health and COVID-19: a discourse on the importance of the enforcement of humanitarian and human rights law in conflict settings for the future management of zoonotic pandemic diseases. OBJECTIVES: The catastrophic effects of armed conflict, particularly prolonged armed conflict, on individual and public health are well established. The 'right' to healthcare during armed conflict and its lack of enforcement despite a range of United Nations mandated requirements regarding health and healthcare provisions is likely to be a significant feature in future conflicts, as zoonotic-induced pandemics become a more common global public health challenge. The issue of enforcement of health rights assurance and its implications for the public health management of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in and between countries and regions in conflict is the objective of this Review., STUDY DESIGN: A narrative review was conducted., METHODS: Referenced to the framework of International humanitarian law (IHL) and International human rights law (IHRL) to explore and discuss the deficits in health rights assurances in conflict settings and illustrate how gaps in protection and lack of enforcement compounds the disease response. Both IHL, and IHRL can be leveraged to ensure human and health rights are assured in conflict settings. There is a distinct lack of international criteria with regard to standards of healthcare coverage, infrastructure and service preservation to the civilian population during times of armed conflict. This has far reaching consequences when confounded by a pandemic or even localised disease outbreak., RESULTS: We illustrate how in a pandemic disease emergency, such as COVID-19, all life is threatened; and how leaving the citizen population exposed to this contagion is a human rights breach and an indirect method of warfare. The consequences of failure to effectively address such pandemic infections, (i.e. COVID-19), in a conflict setting are potentially catastrophic as prevention and containment responses are severely constrained by state insecurity, political instability, terrorism, repression, rights abuses, and displacement of citizens. Neglect by State actors potentially constitutes a breach of the universal right to life. States cannot justify their failures to mitigate disease based on claims of lack of resources, even when available resources are minimal. Where discrimination of people with a disease, such as COVID-19, or minority groups at the point of access to health facilities occurs, this further breaches the principle of medical neutrality., CONCLUSIONS: The example of the COVID-19 response may offer a viable route to leverage greater access and coverage of healthcare in conflict and humanitarian settings. A radicalised partnership approach during these times of emergency is warranted, based on an ethical 'humanitarian intervention' approach to provide care to all affected by contagious disease in conflict settings.

0	Antibody persistence in the first 6 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers: a prospective longitudinal study. Objectives: To evaluate longitudinally the persistence of humoral immunity for up to 6 months in a cohort of hospital employees with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): We measured anti-RBD (receptor binding domain of viral spike protein), anti-N (viral nucleoprotein) and neutralizing antibodies at 1, 3 and 6 months after mostly mild COVID-19 in 200 hospital workers using commercial ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Result(s): Antibodies specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) persisted in all participants for up to 6 months. Anti-RBD geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) progressively increased between months 1 (74.2 U/mL, 95%CI: 62.7-87.8), 3 (103.2 U/mL, 95%CI: 87.9-121.2; p < 0.001), and 6 (123.3 U/mL, 95%CI: 103.4-147.0; p < 0.001) in the whole cohort. Anti-N antibodies were detectable in >97% at all times. Neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 99.5% of participants (195/196) at 6 months post infection. Their GMC progressively decreased between months 1 (20.1 AU/mL, 95%CI: 16.9-24.0), 3 (15.2 AU/mL, 95%CI: 13.2-17.6; p < 0.001) and 6 (9.4 AU/mL, 95%CI: 7.7-11.4; p < 0.001). RBD-ACE2-inhibiting antibody titres and anti-RBD antibody concentrations strongly correlated at each timepoint (all r > 0.86, p < 0.001). Disease severity was associated with higher initial anti-RBD and RBD-ACE2-inhibiting antibody titres, but not with their kinetics. Conclusion(s): Neutralizing antibodies persisted at 6 months in almost all participants, indicating more durability than initially feared. Anti-RBD antibodies persisted better and even increased over time, possibly related to the preferential detection of progressively higher-affinity antibodies.Copyright © 2021 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false

0	A longitudinal study of convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and correlation of ABO group, initial neutralizing antibodies (nAb), and body mass index (BMI) with nAb and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics: Proposals for better quality of CCP c. INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the neutralizing (nAb) and binding antibody kinetics in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, especially during the first 100 days after disease onset., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of previously RT-PCR positive (detected by nasopharyngeal swab during the acute phase), male convalescent patients, all with mild symptoms, were enrolled in serial blood sample collection for a longitudinal nAb titers and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA) evaluation. NAbs were detected by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-based VNT), carried out with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MT350282)., RESULTS: A total of 78 male volunteers provided 316 samples, spanning a total of 4820 days of study. Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers >=160 within 100 days after the onset of disease, there was >75% probability of sustaining nAb titers >=160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was >=1280, weight >= 90 kg or obese, according to their body mass index (BMI), as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox hazard regression (all p < .02). There was no correlation between the ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers. High IgG anti-NP (S/CO >=5.0) is a good surrogate for detecting nAb >= 160, defined by the ROC curve (sensitivity = 90.5%; CI95%: 84.5%-94.7%)., CONCLUSION: Selection of CCP donors for multiple collections based on initial high nAb titers (>=1280) or BMI >= 30 kg/m2 provides a simple strategy to achieve higher quality in CCP programs. High IgG anti-NP levels can also be used as surrogate markers for high nAb screening. Copyright © 2021 AABB.	false
0	Generation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Virus for Viral Entry and Neutralization Assays: A 1-Week Protocol. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus requires reliable assays for studying viral entry mechanisms which remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important for the development of therapeutic approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 infection by permitting the screening for neutralizing antibodies and other agents that can block infection. This is particularly important for patients who are at high risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19. The production of pseudotyped viral particles may seem like a daunting task for a non-virology laboratory without experience in the two most commonly used pseudotyping systems, namely retro/lentiviruses and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which lacks the VSV envelope glycoprotein (VSV Delta G). By incorporating the most up-to-date knowledge, we have developed a detailed, easy-to-follow novel protocol for producing SARS-CoV-2 spike-bearing pseudovirus using the VSV-Delta G system. We describe the infection assay which uses GFP fluorescence as a measure of infection in a 24-well live imaging system. We present results of our optimization of the system to enhance viral infection levels through the over-expression of human ACE2 receptor and the overexpression of at least one of two proteases - TMPRSS2 or Furin, as well as, supplementation with Poloxamer 407 (P407) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as adjuvants. We show that the system works efficiently in three unrelated, clinically relevant cell lines: human 293T (renal epithelial) cells, human Calu-3 (lung epithelial) cells, and the non-human primate (African Green Monkey) cell line, Vero-E6 (renal epithelial) cells. In addition, we have used this system to show infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). This system is efficient (virus generation, titration, and infection assays can be performed in 1 week), quantitative, inexpensive, and readily scalable for application in drug development and therapeutic screening approaches.	false
0	Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, coronavirus disease 2019 and abdominal aortic aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the current, world-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor for cellular inoculation and target organ injury. We reviewed ACE2 expression and the role of ACE2 - angiotensin 1-7- Mas receptor axis activity in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis to identify potential COVID-19 influences on AAA disease pathogenesis., METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, National Library of Medicine, USA. Key words included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, AAA, ACE2, ACE or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibitor, angiotensin 1-7, Mas receptor, age, gender, respiratory diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases. Key publications on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AAAs were identified and reviewed., RESULTS: All vascular structural cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and pericytes express ACE2. Cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lupus, certain types of malignancies and viral infection promote ACE2 expression and activity, with the magnitude of response varying by sex and age. Genetic deficiency of AT1 receptor, or pharmacological ACE or AT1 inhibition also increases ACE2 and its catalytic product angiotensin 1-7. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 or Mas receptor augments, whereas ACE2 activation or angiotensin 1-7 treatment attenuates, progression of experimental AAAs. Potential influences of SARS-CoV-2 on AAA pathogenesis include augmented ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor activity resulting from reduced reciprocal ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas activation; increased production of proaneurysmal mediators stimulated by viral spike proteins in ACE2-negative myeloid cells or by ACE2-expressing vascular structural cells; augmented local or systemic cross-talk between viral targeted non-vascular, non-leukocytic ACE2-expressing cells via ligand recognition of their cognate leukocyte receptors; and hypoxemia and increased systemic inflammatory tone experienced during severe COVID-19 illness., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may theoretically influence AAA disease through multiple SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanisms. Further investigation and clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will influence the prevalence, progression and lethality of AAA disease in the coming decade.

0	Building Strong Futures: The Feasibility of Using a Targeted Digital Media Campaign to Improve Knowledge About Pregnancy and Low Birthweight Among Black Women. OBJECTIVE: Low birthweight is one of the main causes of poor health outcomes among newborns, with Black women having a disproportionately high prevalence. A digital intervention targeted Black women in Orange County, Florida with information on positive pregnancy-related knowledge and attitudes related to low birthweight. This paper reports on campaign methods for the first 2.5 years of implementation. METHOD(S): Campaign content was tailored toward Black women, around a reproductive empowerment lens. Content focused on emphasizing healthy pregnancy-related behaviors and creating positive representations of Black women throughout the various stages of pregnancy through both static images and a web series. Digital metrics gauged campaign engagement. Three cross-sectional online surveys conducted in the intervention county examined Black women's pregnancy-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. RESULT(S): After two years of campaign implementation, social media accounts showed 1784 followers. While Facebook showed more average monthly impressions, Instagram showed more average monthly engagements. Survey results showed some increases in knowledge about prenatal care, weight gain, exercise, and the health impacts of low birthweight. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study highlights the potential for a culturally-appropriate digital intervention to promote positive pregnancy outcomes among at-risk women. Digital interventions offer a potential way to achieve positive pregnancy-related behavior changes on a larger scale. This may be particularly important given that the COVID-19 pandemic may be changing the ways that pregnant women access information. Studies should examine the impact and feasibility of using culturally-appropriate digital interventions that directly address Black women and their specific experiences during pregnancy.	false
0	Clinical course of COVID-19 infection in inflammatory rheumatological patients: A monocentric Belgian experience. Objective: Little is known about the incidence and consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. To improve our knowledge in this field, we collected data from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed COVID-19 infection. Method(s): We performed a monocentric observational longitudinal study and collected data retrospectively from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection between 3 March and 10 June 2020. Result(s): A total of 23 patients developed COVID-19 infection. Seven patients needed hospitalization [female 57%, mean age 59 +/- 9 years], and 16 patients were followed as outpatients [female 80%, mean age 50 +/- 14 years]. All hospitalized patients had more than one co-morbidity. At the time of infection, all patients were on immunosuppressive therapy consisting of either conventional synthetic DMARDs and/or biotherapy, with or without CSs. A minority received Corticoids (CSs) only. The most common symptoms of COVID-19-infected patients were fever, dyspnoea, cough and fatigue. PCR and chest CT were performed in all hospitalized patients to confirm the diagnosis (100% positive PCR, 71% positive CT). All outclinic patients were diagnosed clinically (confirmed by PCR in only one). The mean length of hospital stay was 21 +/- 19 days. Three patients developed an ARDS, including one who died. Conclusion(s): A limited number of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases suffered from COVID-19 infection. Two patients needed mechanical ventilation and survived, whereas one patient died. All patients with a severe form of infection had at least one co-morbidity. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

0	Pathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients: a scoping review. OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic had intense social and economic effects. Patients infected with COVID-19 may present with a series of conditions. A considerable number of patients express taste and smell disturbances as a prodromal, coexistent, or as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The objective of the present review is to review the hypothetical mechanisms of action and etiopathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple scientific databases were explored, including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane-library, LILACS, Livivo and OpenGrey. All types of articles that discussed the pathogenesis of dysgeusia were included, while articles that described dysgeusia without detail about its mode of action were excluded., RESULTS: A total of 47 articles, with different designs, were included in this review. These articles suggested direct viral neural invasion to olfactory and gustatory nerves, viral cytotoxicity to taste buds, angiotensin II imbalance, augmented pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disturbances in salivary glands and sialic acid. COVID-19 induced-dysgeusia was also associated with systemic diseases, medications, zinc, chemicals, and disinfectants., CONCLUSIONS: The most likely cause of transient dysgeusia in COVID-19 is peripheral neurotropism and direct toxicity to taste buds or olfactory epithelium. Other factors may also play a contributory role in dysgeusia, such as a defect in the quality and quantity of saliva, pro-inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin II accumulation, systemic diseases, hypozincemia, and excessive use of chemicals.	false
0	Massive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing on Rural Communities in Manabi Province (Ecuador) Reveals Severe COVID-19 Outbreaks. Rural communities from Latin America are particularly susceptible to develop serious outbreaks of infectious diseases. Inadequate diagnosis and poor health infrastructure jeopardize proper contact tracing and other actions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in the region. We herein describe the preliminary data of our ongoing fieldwork of massive testing among nonhospitalized rural population in Manabi Province of the coastal region of Ecuador. A total of 1,479 people from six different rural communities were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR following the CDC protocol; 350 individuals tested positive, resulting in an overall attack rate of 23.7% for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This ultrahigh prevalence must urge to the public health authorities from Ecuador to take immediate actions to counteract this dramatic scenario in Manabi Province and to improve SARS-CoV-2 testing countrywide.	false
0	Hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver cancer remains a global health challenge, with an estimated incidence of >1 million cases by 2025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for ~90% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for HCC development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced HCC. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of HCC management at all evolutionary stages.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.	false
0	Clinical performance evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test for determining past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Objectives: Due to the number of asymptomatic infections and limited access to high-performance antibody tests, the true prevalence and seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. To fill this gap, the clinical performance of a point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Assay, a chromatographic immunoassay for detecting IgM/IgG antibodies, in near patient settings was assessed. Method(s): Forty-two anti-SARS-Cov-2 positive (CoV+) and 92 anti-SARS-Cov-2 negative (CoV-) leftover samples from before December 2019 were assessed; the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 was used as the reference assay. Analytical specificity was tested using leftover samples collected before December 2019 from patients with common cold symptoms. Result(s): The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test was 100.0% (95% CI 91.59-100.0) sensitive and 96.74% (95% CI 90.77-99.32) specific, with 0.00% assay failure rate. No cross-reactivity was observed against the common cold panel. Method comparison was additionally conducted by two external laboratories, using 100 CoV+ and 275 CoV- samples, also comparing whole blood versus plasma matrix. The comparison demonstrated 96.00% positive and 96.36% negative percent agreement for plasma with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and 99.20% percent overall agreement between whole blood and EDTA plasma. Conclusion(s): The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test demonstrated similar performance to the manufacturer's data and a centralised automated immunoassay, with no cross-reactivity with common cold panels.Copyright © 2021 The Authors	false
0	Depressive symptoms among Peruvian adult residents amidst a National Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Population health and well-being in Latin America, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been severely affected during the past semester. Despite the growing evidence about the link between the pandemic, its control measures, and mental health worldwide, there is still no regional evidence of the potential mental health impact. We describe the prevalence and distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic and socioeconomic risk factors in the Peruvian population amidst a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted during the community transmission phase and national lockdown in Peru (May 4th-16th, 2020). We recorded 64,493 responses from adult Peruvian residents through an opt-in online questionnaire. All analyses were weighted using raking based on proportions of sociodemographic variables from the last Peruvian census in 2017. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was calculated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 10 or more. We identified associated demographic and socioeconomic factors by prior mental health diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis considered an alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms of PHQ-9 >= 14., RESULTS: A total of 57,446 participants were included in the analytical sample. A third of the participants (n = 23,526, unweighted) showed depressive symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the study. Participants who reported a previous mental health diagnosis doubled the sample prevalence of depressive symptoms (59, 95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) of those without a prior diagnosis. Psychosocial and functioning reactions were largely more prevalent among females and young adults. A dose-response relationship was found between household income and depressive symptoms across previous mental health diagnosis strata, being as low as 32% less in the wealthiest than the most impoverished group (PR: 0.68, 95%CI 0.58,0.79). Other critical factors associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms were lower education level, single, unemployed, and chronic comorbidity., CONCLUSIONS: An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compared to previous years. The mental health burden disproportionately affects women, the younger population, and those with low income and education. As the country eases the social distancing measures, it is crucial to use local evidence to adjust public health policies and mental health services to the renewed population needs.	false
0	The use of electrocardiogram screening to clear athletes for return to sport following COVID-19 infection. Objective: To quantify the occurrence rate of abnormal ECG findings and symptoms following COVID-19 infection., Patients: Adult patients (>18 years old) who were participating in collegiate athletics and previously tested positive for COVID-19 between August 2020 to November 2020., Methods: In this retrospective study, we report findings of electrocardiogram (ECG) testing to screen athletes for cardiac abnormalities following COVID-19. Athletes underwent general examinations and ECG screening prior to being medically cleared for a return to sport following COVID-19. Predetermined predictors were grouped into categorical variables including: 1) Sex; 2) Symptom severity; and 3) BMI (normal vs. overweight = > 24 kg.m-2). These were used to examine differences of abnormal rates occurred between different predictor categories., Results: Of the 170 athletes screened, 6 (3.5%) presented with abnormal ECG criteria and were referred to cardiology. We found no evidence that symptom severity, sex and BMI category were associated with a higher rate of abnormal ECG (p > 0.05). Greater severity of COVID-19 symptoms were associated with higher percentage of ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes and presence of fQRS. Loss of smell, loss of taste, headache and sore throat were the most prevalent symptoms with 32.9%, 38.8%, 36.5% and 25.3% of athletes reporting each symptom, respectively., Conclusions: Preliminary findings indicate a low risk of myocardial injury secondary to COVID-19 infection with less than4% of patients presenting with abnormal ECG and 10% requiring referral to a cardiologist. While viral myocarditis was not demonstrated in any athlete referred for cardiology assessment, two patients developed effusative viral pericarditis. Copyright .	false
0	COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptability among U.S. Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study. OBJECTIVES: Estimate the point prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among U.S. firefighters and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers., METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to administer an anonymous online survey to a national non-probabilistic sample of firefighter and EMS workers., RESULTS: Among the 3,169 respondents, 48.2% expressed high acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available, while 24.2% were unsure and 27.6% reported low acceptability. Using the 'high COVID-19 vaccine acceptability' group as the reference category, the groups with greater odds of reporting low acceptability included those: 30-39 years of age (OR = 3.62 [95% confidence interval = 2.00-6.55]), Black race (3.60[1.12-11.53]), Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity (2.39[1.45-3.92]), with some college education (2.06[1.29-3.27]), married (1.65[1.03-2.65]), of current rank firefighter/ems (2.21[1.60-3.08])., CONCLUSIONS: Over half of U.S. firefighters and EMS workers were uncertain or reported low acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.

0	COVID-19 Imaging: What We Know Now and What Remains Unknown. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus ranges from asymptomatic to severe and sometimes fatal disease, most frequently the result of acute lung injury. The role of imaging has evolved during the pandemic, initially with CT as alternative and possibly superior test compared to RT-PCR, to a more limited role based on specific indications. Several classification and reporting schemes were developed for chest imaging early during the pandemic for patients with suspected COVID-19 to aid in triage when the availability of RT-PCR testing was limited and its performance unclear. Interobserver agreement for categories with findings typical of COVID-19 and those suggesting an alternative diagnosis is high across multiple studies. Furthermore, some studies looking at the extent of lung involvement on chest radiography and CT showed correlations with critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation. In addition to pulmonary manifestations, cardiovascular complications such as thromboembolism and myocarditis have been ascribed to COVID-19, sometimes contributing to neurologic and abdominal manifestations. Finally, artificial intelligence has shown promise in both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia both with respect to radiography and CT.	false
0	A case of an Infant with SARS-CoV-2 hepatitis early after liver transplantation. We present a case of a pediatric liver transplant recipient diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection four days after receiving a living donor liver allograft from her mother. The recipient was a 6-month-old with end-stage liver disease due to biliary atresia and failed Kasai. The infant had an uncomplicated implantation, excellent graft function and down-trending liver enzymes until developing fevers, diarrhea, and moderate respiratory distress requiring non-invasive respiratory support. SARS-CoV-2 testing (nasal swab Polymerase Chain Reaction) was positive on post-operative day (POD) 4. Liver enzymes peaked ~1000 U/L (5-fold higher than the previous day) on POD 6. Histology demonstrated a mixed picture of moderate acute hepatitis and classical elements of mild to moderate acute cellular rejection. Her hepatitis and respiratory symptoms improved coincident with completing treatment with hydroxychloroquine, reduced immunosuppression, and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG).Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"Opportunities for immunocorrection aiming for reduction of morbidity in the areas with adverse occupational and environmental conditions. Previous studies have shown that prolonged professional contact with chemical xenobiotics contributes to sensitization of immune system and development of typical immunopathological processes, i.e., allergies and autoimmune diseases. Origin and severity of immune system disorders depends on the spectrum and duration of exposure to adverse factors and patterns of professional activity at the chemically hazardous facilities. The study of structural and functional changes in cellular, humoral and some factors of innate immunity in people working and living in areas with unfavorable environmental conditions revealed a number of immunological disorders that can be characterized as secondary immunodeficiency conditions, which may manifest with increased frequency of acute respiratory infections and other chronic diseases. Much attention is given to prevention and treatment of secondary immunodeficiency conditions, which are associated with decreased numbers of lymphocytes expressing CD3, CD4, CD8. The purpose of the study was determined by recent positive experience of using highly effective drugs based on thymic regulatory peptides affecting various steps of homeostasis, in order to correct immune disorders caused by exposure to radiation and other toxic substances. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in immunity and effectiveness of immune correction by means of immunotropic drugs, i.e., Thymogen nasal spray, and Cytovir-3 capsules, in the cohorts living and working under the conditions of heavy chemical exposure. We observed 249 persons aged 18 years to 63 years recruited from the employees of the ""Polygon ""Krasny Bor""State Enterprise. The people had longterm professional contacts with the components of industrial toxic waste were under examination. Group 1 consisted of the administration staff, group 2 included drivers of special cargo transport. The control group consisted of 137 employees at the car enterprises in Saint Petersburg. The duration of follow-up observation was 1 year. The patients with a detected decrease in cellular immunity received immunotropic drugs based on alpha-glutamyl-tryptophan (Thymogen nasal spray dosed (Thymogen, 62 persons), or combined encapsuleted Cytovir-3 drug (Cytovir, 31 cases). 14 days after finishing the course, a second immunological study was conducted. Following the immunotropic therapies, the subjects showed an increase in relative content of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ subpopulations, normalization of functional oxygen-dependent metabolism of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocyte system in the NBT test, as well as harmonization of the content of serum immunoglobulin contents. The one-year follow-up showed high effectiveness of these drugs, as shown by decreased incidence of acute infectious and lower exacerbation rates of chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. For the group 1 with working experience of 1 to 5 years, the persons who received Thymogen exhibited lower incidence of acute respiratory viral infections (a 37% decrease), like as less frequency of bronchopulmonary diseases (by 25% from the baseline). The patients with long-term work experience in an unfavorable area (Group 2), who received Thymogen, have shown four-fold reduction in acute respiratory morbidity, decreased frequency of other respiratory diseases (1.5-fold), and disorders of digestive organs (a 1.75-fold decrease). Among persons from the 1st and 2nd groups with work experience of up to 1 year, who received Cytovir-3, the SARS incidence decreased by 1.95 and 2.0 times, respectively. It is shown that timely detection of immune system disorders induced by the influence of complex harmful chemical factors, and administration of selective immunocorrecting therapy may contribute to reduction of acute and chronic morbidity in the people working under unfavorable environmental conditions.Copyright © 2020, SPb RAACI."	false
0	Peri-operative outcomes in children and young people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The peri-operative outcomes of children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are poorly understood. Unpublished national databases suggest children follow a 'normal' peri-operative course; however, adult studies, such as COVIDSurg, demonstrate postoperative pulmonary complications of 51.2% and associated mortality of 23.8% [1]. We present the outcomes of five children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent procedures ranging from emergency cardiac to minor day-case surgery. Description Two of five children presented with non-specific symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, three were asymptomatic. The cases are summarised in Table 1. Patients 1 and 2 were complex ASA 3 infants with congenital heart disease and were ventilated in critical care postoperatively. Patient 1 presented with profound hypoxia due to undiagnosed transposition of the great arteries. He underwent an emergency balloon atrial septostomy and an arterial switch operation (open cardiac surgery) following a period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patient 2, with complex medical needs, had non-specific respiratory symptoms. She underwent three general anaesthetics for minor procedures. Neither patient suffered peri-operative respiratory complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and both patients followed the expected postoperative course proportionate with their underlying pathology. ASA 1-2 patients 3, 4 and 5, also followed the expected postoperative course without respiratory complication. Patient 4 was pyrexial with abdominal symptoms and underwent open appendicectomy. Patient 3 had two general anaesthetics to manage a urological malignancy and Patient 5 had an ear laceration repaired under local anaesthesia. Both were asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Discussion This case series adds to the limited existing data on the peri-operative impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Our work supports the hypothesis that children and young people with SARS-CoV-2 follow the 'expected' peri-operative course [1, 2]. Despite their heterogeneity, small size and complexity, no infants or children at our institution experienced adverse outcomes secondary to SARS-CoV-2. These findings are reassuring to anaesthetists delivering paediatric care. The disease burden and severity of COVID-19 is understood to be lower in paediatric populations; however, multicentre studies are required to formally characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children undergoing surgery.	false
0	Transcranial magnetic stimulation in us military veterans-a naturalistic study in the veterans health administration. Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, hereafter TMS) has emerged as evidence-based treatment for pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for over a decade. In that time, data has emerged supporting the use of TMS utilizing different devices, settings, and patient populations. One particular patient population of interest in the US are military Veterans; this patient group is thought to have generally higher levels of medical and psychiatric comorbidity, as well as elevated risk for suicide. A recent negative study of TMS indicated that active stimulation did not separate from sham, and poor response was particularly prevalent in Veterans who had comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder. Yet, other studies have consistently indicated efficacy of TMS for Veterans including with PTSD in other studies. To this end, the VA instituted a nationwide rollout of TMS, with the purpose to evaluate clinical outcomes in naturalistic settings and thus inform real-world practice. This abstract reports clinical outcomes of the first cohort of patients to receive TMS at the VA as part of this program, where we hypothesized that TMS would be safe, well tolerated, and provide clinically meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms as well as comorbid PTSD symptoms. Method(s): VA Palo Alto Healthcare System Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center served as the central coordinating site for this naturalistic study; the VA Palo Alto/ Stanford Institutional Review Board approved procedures related to this report. Individual sites received training through the coordinating site and data gathered through a centralized VA REDCap database. Veterans were eligible for TMS if they met standard inclusion/clearance criteria for TMS (e.g., failure of at least one antidepressant in the current major depressive episode, etc.); in general other treatments were unchanged for approximately six weeks before stimulation, and remained unchanged during stimulation, although this could be modified depending on a Veteran's clinical situation. TMS parameters were at local clinical discretion, and generally were high frequency stimulation (10Hz or intermittent theta burst) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 120% of motor threshold over 6-8 weeks. Depression and PTSD symptoms were measured using the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ9) and PTSD symptom checklist for DSM5 (PCL-5); outcomes of interest included mean changes in both rating scales, as well as dichotomous outcomes describing response (>50% reduction) and remission (score<5) on the PHQ9, and clinically meaningful reduction (>10 points) and those no longer meeting threshold criteria for PTSD (score <33) on the PCL-5. Safety outcomes were measured through database queries and separate inquiries across the sites. Outcomes were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests and missing data were addressed using multiple imputations. This report includes all Veterans that received TMS up until March 2020 (i.e., pre-COVID). Result(s): The cohort included N=413 Veterans with major depression. 380 (92%) reported some degree of PTSD symptoms, and 275 (66.6%) had threshold-level PTSD symptoms. Average age was 51 years (SD = 14.14, range 22 - 89), and 74.2 % identified as male. The majority of Veterans were treated with high frequency stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There was a significant decrease in self-reported depression symptoms on the PHQ9 (t(412) = 24.15, p < 0.01; pre-TMS: mean = 18.2, standard deviation = 5.06, post-TMS: mean = 10.66, standard deviation = 7.12). Depression response and remission rates were 46.2% (n=191) and 23.7% (n=98), respectively. There was also a significant decrease on self-reported PTSD symptoms on the PCL-5 (t(379) = 18.85, p < 0.01; pre-TMS : mean = 43.80 SD = 18.36, post-TMS: M = 28.15, SD = 20.42). Of the Veterans with threshold-level PTSD symptoms at baseline, n=159 (57.5%) demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction and n=130 (47.2%) no longer met PTSD threshold criteria post-treatment. TMS was generally safe as delivered; four Veterans experienced unexpected side effects requiring significant medical intervention. One Veteran reportedly had a seizure (H-coil), and five were hospitalized for worsened psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion(s): This data represents the first multisite naturalistic study of TMS for Veterans with pharmacoresistant major depression. Consistent with this patient population, the majority reported comorbid MDD & PTSD. TMS resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in depressive and PTSD symptoms. Stimulation was safe as provided, with side effects consistent with the known profile of TMS. Limitations include those inherent to naturalistic cohort studies. Furthermore, all Veterans were engaged in concurrent clinical care, and we did not differentiate between different stimulation parameters. Future reports, using the associated network of clinical sites, will focus on. key related questions including evaluating the impact of different TMS parameters or approaches, as well as the study of biological outcomes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography to better identify biomarkers of treatment response in this population. Caveats notwithstanding, this is the largest report of TMS in Veterans and provides a clear indication of efficacy and safety in real-world environments.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aquatic food animal species or their products: A review. Outbreaks of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) have been reported in workers in fish farms and fish processing plants arising from person-to-person transmission, raising concerns about aquatic animal food products' safety. A better understanding of such incidents is important for the aquaculture industry's sustainability, particularly with the global trade in fresh and frozen aquatic animal food products where contaminating virus could survive for some time. Despite a plethora of COVID-19-related scientific publications, there is a lack of reports on the risk of contact with aquatic food animal species or their products. This review aimed to examine the potential for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) contamination and the potential transmission via aquatic food animals or their products and wastewater effluents. The extracellular viability of SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus is spread are reviewed, supporting the understanding that contaminated cold-chain food sources may introduce SAR-CoV-2 via food imports although the virus is unlikely to infect humans through consumption of aquatic food animals or their products or drinking water; i.e., SARS-CoV-2 is not a foodborne virus and should not be managed as such but instead through strong, multifaceted public health interventions including physical distancing, rapid contact tracing, and testing, enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, frequent disinfection of high-touch surfaces, isolation of infected workers and their contacts, as well as enhanced screening protocols for international seafood trade.

0	COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although most of the infected individuals are asymptomatic, a proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease with multiple organ injuries. Evidence suggests that some medications used to treat autoimmune rheumatologic diseases might have therapeutic effect in patients with severe COVID-19 infections, drawing attention to the relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. COVID-19 shares similarities with autoimmune diseases in clinical manifestations, immune responses and pathogenic mechanisms. Robust immune reactions participate in the pathogenesis of both disease conditions. Autoantibodies as a hallmark of autoimmune diseases can also be detected in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some patients have been reported to develop autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain--Barre syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, after COVID-19 infection. It is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can disturb self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune responses through cross-reactivity with host cells. The infection risk and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune diseases remains controversial, but patient adherence to medication regimens to prevent autoimmune disease flares is strongly recommended. SUMMARY: We present a review of the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, focusing on similarities in immune responses, cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2, the development of autoimmune diseases in COVID-19 patients and the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with preexisting autoimmune conditions.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	The psychological impact of COVID-19-related lockdown measures among a sample of Italian patients with eating disorders: a preliminary longitudinal study. PURPOSE: To explore the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression, along with PTSD- and ED-related symptoms, across a sample of patients with Eating Disorders (EDs) compared to a group of healthy controls (HC) during the lockdown period in Italy; to assess whether patients' reported aforementioned psychiatric symptoms improved, remained stable or worsened with the easing of the lockdown measures., METHODS: t0 assessment (during lockdown): 59 ED patients and 43 HC completed an online survey, including the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and specific ad-hoc questions extracted from the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; t1 assessment (post-lockdown): 40 EDs patients, a subset of the t0 sample, completed the same assessment 2 months after t0., RESULTS: EDs patients scored higher than HC at the DASS-21, IES-R and PSS. At t1, levels of stress, anxiety and depression were not different than at t0, but symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), patients' reported level of psychological wellbeing and specific EDs symptomatology improved., DISCUSSION: During the lockdown, EDs patients presented significantly higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD- and ED-related symptoms than HC. With the easing of the lockdown, PTSD- and ED-related symptoms improved, but high levels of stress, anxiety and depression persisted., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, experimental study.	false
0	A survey of anxiety and burnout in the radiology workforce of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION: We aimed to study anxiety and burnout among Division of Radiological Sciences (RADSC) staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential risk and protective factors. These outcomes were compared with non-RADSC staff., METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted between 12 March and 20 July 2020 in the largest public tertiary hospital receiving COVID-19 cases. Burnout and anxiety were assessed with the Physician Work-Life Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, respectively. Workplace factors were examined as potential risk and protective factors using multivariable ordinary least squares regression analyses, adjusting for pertinent demographic characteristics., RESULTS: RADSC staff (n = 180) and non-RADSC staff (n = 1458) demonstrated moderate-to-severe anxiety rates of 6.7 and 13.2 % and burnout rates of 17.8 and 23.9 %, respectively. RADSC staff reported significantly lower anxiety (mean +/- SD: 4.0 +/- 3.7 vs 4.9 +/- 4.5; P-value < 0.05), burnout (mean +/- SD: 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs 2.1 +/- 0.8; P-value < 0.01), increased teamwork (82.2% vs 74.1%; P-value < 0.05) and fewer night shifts (36.7% vs 41.1%; P-value < 0.01). Among RADSC staff, higher job dedication was associated with lower anxiety (b (95% CI) = -0.28 (-0.45, -0.11)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = -0.07 (-0.11,-0.04)), while longer than usual working hours was associated with increased anxiety (b (95% CI) = 1.42 (0.36, 2.45)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = 0.28 (0.09, 0.48))., CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of RADSC staff reported significant burnout and anxiety, although less compared to the larger hospital cohort. Measures to prevent longer than usual work hours and increase feelings of enthusiasm and pride in one's job may further reduce the prevalence of anxiety problems and burnout in radiology departments.

0	A systematic review on treatment-related mucocutaneous reactions in COVID-19 patients. Most of drugs could have certain mucocutaneous reactions and COVID-19 drugs are not an exception that we focused. We systematically reviewed databases until August 15, 2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts, and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, and so on. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and and so on. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions, which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. Lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	Scoping Review of Existing Stroke Guidelines; Argument for a Value-Added Change. <h4>Background and Purpose</h4> Stroke represents one of the most important causes of morbidity ( eighty million patients with disabling of ongoing effects of stroke at a given time, globally) and mortality (the second leading cause of death) worldwide. Innovative systems biology-based approach is likely to increase the understanding of the underpinning of acute stroke promise to enhance stroke prevention, acute treatment, and neurorehabilitation. Recent growing body of evidence with shared pathobiology with COVID-19 and the critically important role of inflammation in the context of stroke points to far-reaching consequences of acute stroke, just as in the case of COVID-19 ( post-acute event issues as well as long term issues). So far, stroke typically defined by late-appearing disease manifestation by the range of stroke subtypes as defined by the WHO or American Stroke Association. This definition neglects the underlying pathobiological mechanisms such as low-grade chronic inflammation and already compromised vascular system. Diseases such as stroke is hardly a simple result of a single problem, but rather a complex cascade of pathobiological processes and interactions in a complex biochemical environment. The evidence of changes in innate immunity and adaptive immunity during the index event of acute stroke and recovery over next 3-12 months can be easily elicited with simple bedside blood tests such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with well over 300 published papers including several systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirming this. Global standard operating procedures (SOP) of stroke care dictated by the national and international stroke guidelines at present. It is imperative to explore the evidence of systems biology approach in current stroke guidelines. This is likely to be a key turning point in managing stroke across the continuum (prevention, management of acute event and rehabilitation). <h4>Methods</h4> We systematically searched for guideline recommendation on the day-to-day use of peripheral inflammatory markers such as NLR published in the English language between January 1, 2005, and December 2020. Any other evidence of systems biology-based approach or recommendation was explored within the selected guidelines for this scoping review. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 4 authors to determine clinical scenarios explained/given, scientific evidence used, and recommendations presented in the context of systems biology. <h4>Results</h4> The scoping review found 3,830 (3830) titles with 119 guidelines from 46 countries included for this review ( Figure 1; PRISMA diagram). Stroke-related organizations wrote Sixty-five per cent of the guidelines while national ministries wrote a fewer number of guidelines. We were primarily interested in recommendations for acute management in AIS published in the English language. Fifteen eligible guidelines were identified from 15 different countries/regions. None of the guidelines recommended the routine use of peripheral markers of inflammation, such as NLR, among their acute assessment and management recommendations. None of the existing guidelines explored the systems biology approach to one of the most complex diseases affecting the human brain, stroke. Figure 1 Acute Ischemic Stroke Guidelines Worldwide Figure 2: PRISMA Diagram <h4>Conclusions</h4> This systematic review has identified a significant evidence-practice gap in all existing national stroke guidelines published in English medium as of October 2020. These guidelines included the only current “living stroke guidelines, Stroke Guidelines from Australia with a real opportunity to modernize the living stroke guidelines with systems biology approach and provide 2020 vision towards better stroke care globally. Investigation of complex disease such as stroke is best served through a systems biology approach. One of the easiest places to start is simple blood tests such as total white cell count and NLR. Systems biology approach point us towards simple tools such immune-inflammatory index (SII), Sunshine Prognostic Score (SPS) which should pave the way for the stroke physician community address the challenges in systems biology approach in stroke care. These challenges include translating bench research to the bedside, managing big data ( continuous pulse, blood pressure, sleep, Oxygen saturation, progressive changes in NLR, SII, SPS, etc.). Working with an interdisciplinary team is also provide a distinct advantage.	false

0	Quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and outcome in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. The disease spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic infection to critical illness and death. Identification of prognostic marker is vital for predicting progression and clinical practice. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, known as RNAemia has been detected in blood. However, the potential clinical value of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia remains unknown. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as well as summary strength of RNAemia in association with disease severity and unfavorable clinical outcomes. A total of 21 studies involving 2181 patients were included. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in COVID-19 patients varied from 9.4% to 74.1%, with a pooled estimate of 34% (95% CI: 26-43%). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was associated with COVID-19 severity with OR of 5.43 (95% CI: 3.46-8.53). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was a significant risk factor for unfavorable clinical outcomes (OR = 6.54, 95% CI: 3.82-11.21). The summary OR was 4.28 (95% CI: 2.20-8.33) for ICU admission, 11.07 (95% CI: 5.60-21.88) for mortality. Furthermore, RNAemia was also a significant risk factor for invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is associated with disease severity, ICU admission, death in COVID-19 and may serve as clinical predictor. More prospective trials in evaluating the potential of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as prognostic indicator are necessary. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Thrombo-inflammatory Biomarkers in COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 17,052 patients. Objective: To evaluate differences in thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers between patients with severe COVID-19 infection/death and mild infection., Patients and Methods: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies comparing thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 among severe/non-survivors and non-severe/survivors from January 1, 2020 through July 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria: (1) hospitalized patients >=18 years comparing severe/non-survivors vs. non-severe/survivors; (2) biomarkers of inflammation and/or thrombosis. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the two groups of COVID-19 severity., Results: Seventy-five studies were included (17,052 patients). Patients with severe COVID-19/non-survivors were older, a greater proportion were men, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and COPD. The thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers were significantly higher in patients with severe disease including D-dimer (WMD 0.60, 0.49-0.71, I2=83.85%), fibrinogen (WMD 0.42, 0.18-0.67, I2=61.88%, p<0.001), CRP (WMD 35.74, 30.16-41.31, I2=85.27%), high sensitivity-CRP (WMD 62.68, 45.27-80.09, I2=0%), Interleukin-6 (WMD 22.81, 17.90-27.72, I2=90.42%) and, ferritin (WMD 506.15, 356.24-656.06, I2=52.02%). Moderate to significant heterogeneity was observed for all parameters. Sub-analysis based on disease severity, mortality, and geographic region of studies demonstrated similar inferences., Conclusions: Thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, Fibrinogen, CRP, hs-CRP, ferritin, and IL-6) and marker of end-organ damage (hs-Troponin I) are associated with increased severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection.

Introduction: With the sudden onset and global dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many nations including Canada attempted to reduce spread of the resultant COVID-19 syndrome with self-isolation and quarantine, while seeking a cure or vaccine for this disease. Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. Methods: The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. Results: 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-hoc analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.

0	"Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: a public health challenge? Reflection on Italian data. A recent Italian report on medicines use during COVID-19 epidemic outlined a non-significant increase in outpatient pharmaceutical antidepressant consumption in March and a significant increase in anxiolytic consumption. Along with this, an analysis of psychiatric hospitalizations in Lombardy revealed a reduction in voluntary admissions in the 40 days after the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Nevertheless, several studies reported a greater prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the Italian general population during the lockdown compared to before the pandemic. Furthermore, the request for psychological support by the Italian population appeared to be high during lockdown. Indeed, the Italian Ministry of Health declared that more than 50,000 calls to the telephone number for psychological support activated by the Ministry of Health and the Civil Protection because of the pandemic, with peaks during the lockdown. In addition, looking at Google Trends, the greatest searching activity for ""psychological support"" in recent years was detected the week of the 26th April 2020, followed by the week of the 22nd March 2020. We think that stronger indicators of mental health status and psychological well-being should be found to understand the long-term effects of the pandemic. The necessity of research for population-level and universal strategies is urgent, through repurposing, developing, and testing interventions to create evidence-based action plans for the entire population. Lastly, it is also essential to keep offering a psychological support suitable for all as done in past months to help individuals who have fewer opportunities to access care."	false
0	Evaluating the effect of infographics on public recall, sentiment and willingness to use face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic: a randomised internet-based questionnaire study. BACKGROUND: The use of face masks remains contentious, with international variation in practice. Their prevalence in the UK, is likely to increase due to new legislation. Clear information regarding the appropriate use of masks is needed, to ensure compliance with policies to reduce transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to assess the impact of visual representations of guidance, or infographics, upon the knowledge of appropriate face mask usage in a representative UK cohort., METHODS: Adult patients were recruited to this randomised internet-based questionnaire study during the 12-14 May 2020 from across the UK. Respondents viewed one of five public health stimuli regarding the use of face masks, or no stimulus. The groups accessed aids by the European Centre for Disease Control (EUCDC), World Health Organisation (WHO), Singaporean Ministry of Health (SMOH), text from the UK government (UK Gov), or an infographic designed by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT). The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of each infographic upon participants' recall of face mask technique, sentiments and willingness to wear a face covering. Secondary outcomes included the effect of symptomology and socio-demographic factors., RESULTS: 4099 respondents were randomised (1009 control, 628 EUCDC, 526 WHO, 639 SMOH, 661 UKGOV and 606 BIT). Stimuli from the WHO, SMOH and BIT demonstrated significantly higher average recall scores compared to the controls (7.40 v. 7.38 v. 7.34 v. 6.97, P < 0.001). BIT's stimulus led to the highest confidence about mask-wearing (87%). Only 48.2% of the cohort felt stimuli reduced anxiety about COVID-19. However, willingness to use a mask was high, (range 84 to 88%)., CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the appropriate use of masks, as mandated by UK law, guidance must provide sufficient information, yet remain understandable. Infographics can aid the recall of correct mask techniques by highlighting salient steps and reducing cognitive burden. They have also demonstrated greater trustworthiness than text-only guidance. The effect of infographics upon COVID-19-related anxiety was poor, and they should be further developed to address this sentiment. A willingness to wear face masks has, however, been demonstrated.	false
0	The modified NUTRIC score can be used for nutritional risk assessment as well as prognosis prediction in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Background & aims: In the newly emerged Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disaster, little is known about the nutritional risks for critically ill patients. It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. Method(s): This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of <18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of <24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of >=5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients' outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. Result(s): A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (>=5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P <0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism	false

0	A Case of Mild COVID-19 in a Teenager with Common Variable Immunodeficiency and Granulomatous Interstitial Lung Disease on Replacement Immunoglobulin and Infliximab. Rationale: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a disorder of the immune system. Patients are generally diagnosed in their adolescence and require regular immunoglobulin replacement. Due to their immune dysregulation, they are at increased risk of infections, autoimmune disease, and cancer. Method(s): To describe a case of mild COVID-19 in a patient with CVID and granulomatous interstitial lung disease on replacement immunoglobulin and infliximab. Result(s): The patient is a 15 year old female with CVID, granulomatous interstitial lung disease, and hepatosplenomegaly with pancytopenia and portal hypertension. She receives weekly SCIG and monthly infliximab. In July, an uncle who visits frequently tested positive for COVID-19. Mother, father, and brother subsequently had mild nasal congestion and tested positive for COVID-19. Our patient developed symptoms of headache and nasal congestion, for which Azithromycin was prescribed and symptoms resolved. No fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of sense of smell or taste was reported. No hospitalization was required. Her most recent labs with lymphocyte subsets revealed normal CD4 and CD8 T cell levels, low CD19 B cell levels, and normal immunoglobulins. Follow up COVID-19 PCR testing 1 month later remains positive. Conclusion(s): There are concerns regarding persons with immunodeficiency being at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. However, our patient's clinical course suggests that certain types of immunodeficiency or immunomodulators may potentially limit the cytokine storm which causes some COVID-19 complications. Further studies are needed.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 Immediately Increases Burnout Symptoms in ICU Professionals: A Longitudinal Cohort Study. OBJECTIVES: ICU professionals are at risk of developing burnout due to coronavirus disease 2019. This study assesses the prevalence and incidence of burnout symptoms and moral distress in ICU professionals before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis., DESIGN: This is a longitudinal open cohort study., SETTING: Five ICUs based in a single university medical center plus another adult ICU based on a separate teaching hospital in the Netherlands., SUBJECTS: All ICU professionals were sent a baseline survey in October-December 2019 (252 respondents, response rate: 53%), and a follow-up survey was sent in May-June 2020 (233 respondents, response rate: 50%)., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Burnout symptoms and moral distress measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Moral Distress Scale, respectively. The prevalence of burnout symptoms was 23.0% before coronavirus disease 2019 and 36.1% at postpeak time, with higher rates in nurses (38.0%) than in physicians (28.6%). Reversely, the incidence rate of new burnout cases among physicians was higher (26.7%) than nurses (21.9%). Higher prevalence of burnout symptoms was observed in the postpeak coronavirus disease 2019 period (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32-2.53), for nurses (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.04), for professionals working overtime (odds ratio 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02), and for professionals directly engaged with care for coronavirus disease 2019 patients (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60). Physicians were more likely than nurses to develop burnout symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.06-12.21)., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that overburdening of ICU professionals during an extended period of time leads to symptoms of burnout. Working long hours and under conditions of scarcity of staff, time, and resources comes at the prize of ICU professionals' mental health.	false
0	Development and clinical application of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strip: A multi-center assessment across China. Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is posing a threat to the public health globally. Serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody can improve early diagnosis of COVID-19 and serves as a valuable supplement to RNA detection. Method(s): A SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test strip based on colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was developed, with both spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 antigen used for antibody detection. From 3 medical institutions across China, serum or plasma of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and 300 normal controls were collected and tested with the strip. Sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Positive rates in different medical centers, age group, gender, and different disease course were compared. Result(s): 158 out 170 samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients had positive results from the test, and 296 out of 300 samples from normal controls had negative results. The kit was 92.9% sensitive and 98.7% specific. The positive rate was 77.3% during the first week after disease onset, but reached 100% since day 9. AUC and kappa coefficient were 0.958 and 0.926, respectively, which showed the consistency of the test results with the standard diagnosis. Age or gender caused little variations in the kit sensitivity. Conclusion(s): The rapid, easy-to-use SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test kit has a superior performance, which can help with accurate diagnosis and thus timely treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients, that contributes to the better control of the global pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Characteristics of intracerebral haemorrhage associated with COVID-19: a systematic review and pooled analysis of individual patient and aggregate data. Background and purpose: There are very few studies of the characteristics and causes of ICH in COVID-19, yet such data are essential to guide clinicians in clinical management, including challenging anticoagulation decisions. We aimed to describe the characteristics of spontaneous symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) associated with COVID-19. Method(s): We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Database for data from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected prior to or within 7 days after symptomatic ICH. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data, then combined data from this pooled analysis with aggregate-level data. Result(s): We included data from 139 patients (98 with individual data and 41 with aggregate-level data). In our pooled individual data analysis, the median age (IQR) was 60 (53-67) years and 64% (95% CI 54-73.7%) were male; 79% (95% CI 70.0-86.9%) had critically severe COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of lobar ICH was 67% (95% CI 56.3-76.0%), and of multifocal ICH was 36% (95% CI 26.4-47.0%). 71% (95% CI 61.0-80.4%) of patients were treated with anticoagulation (58% (95% CI 48-67.8%) therapeutic). The median NIHSS was 28 (IQR 15-28); mortality was 54% (95% CI 43.7-64.2%). Our combined analysis of individual and aggregate data showed similar findings. The pooled incidence of ICH across 12 cohort studies of inpatients with COVID-19 (n = 63,390) was 0.38% (95% CI 0.22-0.58%). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that ICH associated with COVID-19 has different characteristics compared to ICH not associated with COVID-19, including frequent lobar location and multifocality, a high rate of anticoagulation, and high mortality. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms of ICH in COVID-19 with potential implications for clinical treatment and trials.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Scoping Review of Existing Stroke Guidelines; Argument for a Value-Added Change<strong> </strong>. Stroke represents one of the most important causes of morbidity ( eighty million patients with disabling of ongoing effects of stroke at a given time, globally) and mortality (the second leading cause of death) worldwide. Innovative systems biology-based approach is likely to increase the understanding of the underpinning of acute stroke promise to enhance stroke prevention, acute treatment, and neurorehabilitation. Recent growing body of evidence with shared pathobiology with COVID-19 and the critically important role of inflammation in the context of stroke points to far-reaching consequences of acute stroke, just as in the case of COVID-19 ( post-acute event issues as well as long term issues ) . So far, stroke typically defined by late-appearing disease manifestation by the range of stroke subtypes as defined by the WHO or American Stroke Association. This definition neglects the underlying pathobiological mechanisms such as low-grade chronic inflammation and already compromised vascular system. Diseases such as stroke is hardly a simple result of a single problem, but rather a complex cascade of pathobiological processes and interactions in a complex biochemical environment. The evidence of changes in innate immunity and adaptive immunity during the index event of acute stroke and recovery over next 3-12 months can be easily elicited with simple bedside blood tests such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with well over 300 published papers including several systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirming this. Global standard operating procedures (SOP) of stroke care dictated by the national and international stroke guidelines at present. It is imperative to explore the evidence of systems biology approach in current stroke guidelines. This is likely to be a key turning point in managing stroke across the continuum (prevention, management of acute event and rehabilitation).	false
0	A Case Series of Severe Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients Treated with Tocilizumab and Glucocorticoids: A Report from Saudi Arabian Hospital. BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is variable and ranges from asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, moderately severe and severe disease. A small proportion might develop severe disease and may have cytokine storm. One of the therapeutic options to treat such cases is Tocilizumab (TCZ). In this study, we present cases of severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids and discuss the treatment responses., METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of severe COVID-19 cases treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids. The case series examined the characteristics and outcome of those patients., RESULTS: This study included 40 Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed patients who received TCZ and glucocorticoids. The mean age of the included patients was 57.55 (+/-Standard deviation 12.86) years. There were 34 (85%) males, 19 (47.5%) were obese (BMI >30), 13 (32.5%) over weight, and five (12.5%) normal weight. The mean days from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to admission was 1.641 (+/-3.2) days. Of the patients, 18 (45%) had diabetes mellitus, 14 (35%) had hypertension. The mean days from hospital admission to ICU was 1.8 (+/-2.6), 20 (50%) required mechanical ventilation, 39 (97.5%) had received prone position, seven (17.5%) had renal replacement therapy, 13 (32.5%) required inotropes, four (10%) had plasmapheresis, one (2.5%) had intravenous immunoglobulin, all patients received steroid therapy, and the majority 31 (77.5%) did not receive any anti-viral therapy. Of all the patients, six (15%) died, 28 (70%) were discharged and six (15%) were still in hospital., CONCLUSION: The overall mortality rate was lower than those cited in meta-analysis. As our understanding of the COVID-19 continues, the approach and therapeutics are also evolving. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press International B.V.	false
0	Is liver involvement overestimated in COVID-19 patients? A meta-analysis. Background: Considering transaminase more than the upper limit of normal value as liver injury might overestimate the prevalence of liver involvement in COVID-19 patients. No meta-analysis has explored the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the reported prevalence of liver injury. Moreover, few studies reported the extent of hypertransaminasemia stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. Method(s): A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The pooled prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia was estimated. Result(s): In total, 60 studies were included. The overall prevalence of liver injury was 25%. Compared to subgroups with the non-strict definition of liver injury (33%) and subgroups without giving detailed definition (26%), the subgroup with a strict definition had a much lower prevalence of liver injury (9%). The overall prevalence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 19% and 22%. The prevalence of elevated ALT and AST were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases (31% vs 16% and 44% vs 11%). In critically ill and fatal cases, no difference was found in the prevalence of elevated ALT (24% vs 30%) or AST (54% vs 49%). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the adjusted prevalence of ALT elevation, AST elevation, and liver injury decreased to 14%, 7%, and 12%. Conclusion(s): The overall prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia in COVID-19 patients might be overestimated. Only a small fraction of COVID-19 patients have clinically significant liver injury. The prevalence of hypertransaminasemia was significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases. Hence, in severe COVID-19 patients, more attention should be paid to liver function tests.Copyright © The author(s).	false
0	The prognostic value of comorbidity for the severity of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With the increase in the number of COVID-19 infections, the global health apparatus is facing insufficient resources. The main objective of the current study is to provide additional data regarding the clinical characteristics of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and in particular to analyze the factors associated with disease severity, lack of improvement, and mortality., METHODS: 102 studies were included in the present meta-analysis, all of which were published before September 24, 2020. The studies were found by searching a number of databases, including Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase. We performed a thorough search from early February until September 24. The selected papers were evaluated and analyzed using Stata software application version 14., RESULTS: Ultimately, 102 papers were selected for this meta- analysis, covering 121,437 infected patients. The mean age of the patients was 58.42 years. The results indicate a prevalence of 79.26% for fever (95% CI: 74.98-83.26; I2 = 97.35%), 60.70% for cough (95% CI: 56.91-64.43; I2 = 94.98%), 33.21% for fatigue or myalgia (95% CI: 28.86-37.70; I2 = 96.12%), 31.30% for dyspnea (95% CI: 26.14-36.69; I2 = 97.67%), and 10.65% for diarrhea (95% CI: 8.26-13.27; I2 = 94.20%). The prevalence for the most common comorbidities was 28.30% for hypertension (95% CI: 23.66-33.18; I2 = 99.58%), 14.29% for diabetes (95% CI: 11.88-16.87; I2 = 99.10%), 12.30% for cardiovascular diseases (95% CI: 9.59-15.27; I2 = 99.33%), and 5.19% for chronic kidney disease (95% CI: 3.95-6.58; I2 = 96.42%)., CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the prevalence of some of the most important comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, indicating that some underlying disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney disease, can be considered as risk factors for patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the results show that an elderly male with underlying diseases is more likely to have severe COVID-19.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) markedly increased mortality in patients with hip fracture - A systematic review and meta-analysis. Introduction: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on mortality in patients with hip fracture. Method(s): We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Central Database, and medRvix from inception up to July 13, 2020 on research articles that enrolled hip fracture patients who had information on COVID-19 and clinically validated definition of death. Result(s): A total of 984 participants from 6 studies were included in our study. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 was 9% [95% CI: 7-11%]. The mortality rate in patients with concomitant hip fracture and COVID-19 was found to be 36% (95% CI: 26-47%), whereas the mortality rate in hip fracture without COVID-19 is 2% (95% CI: 1-3%). Meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 was associated with a seven-fold increase in risk (RR 7.45 [95% CI: 2.72, 20.43], p < 0.001; I2: 68.6%) of mortality in patients with hip fracture. Regression-based Harbord's test showed no indication of small-study effects (p = 0.06). Conclusion(s): The present meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 increased the risk of mortality in patients with hip fracture.

0	Sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic by population: a systematic review and meta-analysis. STUDY OBJECTIVES: No systematic review or meta-analysis has yet been conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of sleep problems among the general population, health care workers, or patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to assess the impact and prevalence of sleep problems among those categories. METHOD(S): American Psychological Association PsycINFO, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EBSCOhost, EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ProQuest Medical, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019 to July 5, 2020 were used. Additionally, 5 preprints servers (medRxiv.org; preprints.org; psyarxiv.com; arXiv.org; biorxiv.org) were also searched for papers accepted after peer review but not yet published and indexed. There was no language restriction. The random-effect models meta-analysis model was used with the DerSimonian and Laird methodology. RESULT(S): Forty-four papers, involving a total of 54,231 participants from 13 countries, were judged relevant and contributed to the systematic review and meta-analysis of sleep problems during COVID-19. The global pooled prevalence rate of sleep problems among all populations was 35.7% (95% confidence interval, 29.4-42.4%). Patients with COVID-19 appeared to be the most affected group, with a pooled rate of 74.8% (95% confidence interval, 28.7-95.6%). Health care workers and the general population had comparative rates of sleep problems, with rates of 36.0% (95% confidence interval, 21.1-54.2%) and 32.3% (95% confidence interval, 25.3-40.2%), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic is high and affects approximately 40% of people from the general and health care populations. Patients with active COVID-19 appeared to have a higher prevalence rates of sleep problems.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.	false
0	On the Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a Temperate Climate. An epidemiological model, which describes the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under specific consideration of the incubation period including the population with subclinical infections and being infective is presented. The COVID-19 epidemic in Greece was explored through a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis framework, and the optimal values for the parameters that determined the transmission dynamics could be obtained before, during, and after the interventions to control the epidemic. The dynamic change of the fraction of asymptomatic individuals was shown. The analysis of the modelling results at the intra-annual climatic scale allowed for in depth investigation of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the significance and relative importance of the model parameters. Moreover, the analysis at this scale incorporated the exploration of the forecast horizon and its variability. Three discrete peaks were found in the transmission rates throughout the investigated period (15 February-15 December 2020). Two of them corresponded to the timing of the spring and autumn epidemic waves while the third one occurred in mid-summer, implying that relaxation of social distancing and increased mobility may have a strong effect on rekindling the epidemic dynamics offsetting positive effects from factors such as decreased household crowding and increased environmental ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the epidemiological state was found to constitute a significant indicator of the forecast reliability horizon, spanning from as low as few days to more than four weeks. Embedding the model in an ensemble framework may extend the predictability horizon. Therefore, it may contribute to the accuracy of health risk assessment and inform public health decision making of more efficient control measures.	false
0	Interprofessional burnout and the impact of leadership. Burnout is an area of topical interest particularly with the recent impact of COVID-19. Many staff had to go above and beyond their normal role to support critically ill patients. Much like Maslow's hierarchy of needs [1], wellbeing approaches have to be adapted to multiple levels in order to be effective. Although many reported initiatives report short-term success, we aimed to identify issues that reduce the success of wellbeing initiatives over the longer term. Methods We launched multi-level intervention initiatives to promote interprofessional wellbeing. These interventions included staff education sessions, 'praise a colleague box', critical incident debriefs, departmental snacks and a wellbeing social media group. To measure the impact of these interventions, we launched feedback sheets for teaching interventions and a qualitative survey towards the end of the first peak, featuring Likert scale and free-text sections. Results Initial feedback was promising from the teaching events and social media group. All teaching events scored highly with free-text themes suggesting they were beneficial and relevant; however, our qualitative study of 38 participants showed an overall negative wellbeing score that approached significance on Student's t test. Free-text themes suggested communication issues, particularly misinformation, contributed to negativity. The most successful intervention from our study was peer support from colleagues. Discussion Despite multiple interventions, we failed to demonstrate a sustained response. Interestingly peer support proved the most effective to maintain staff morale. Although we had initial apparent success, factors such as misinformation impaired impact. On reflection, we suggest the leadership model used to implement these initiatives was ineffective. The authors propose leadership education, utilising transformative leadership models, which may have allowed greater targeting of junior doctor run wellbeing initiatives allowing adaptation to concern from frontline staff. Utilising leadership models in junior doctor wellbeing projects would benefit from Johari windowing [2], potentially achieving a unique perspective to target interventions.	false
0	Implications of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Dengue Transmission in Malaysia. We aim to investigate the effect of large-scale human movement restrictions during the COVID-19 lockdown on both the dengue transmission and vector occurrences. This study compared the weekly dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the previous years (2015 to 2019) and a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the trend of dengue incidence during the first two weeks (stage 1) of lockdown decreased significantly with the incidences lower than the lower confidence level (LCL) of SARIMA. By comparing the magnitude of the gradient of decrease, the trend is 319% steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 650% steeper than the simulated model, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from stage 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by four weeks and grew with an exponential pattern. We revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species and demonstrated a strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences, and therefore we proposed the possible diffusive effect of the vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate.	false
0	Review of risk of covid-19 in cancer patients and their cohabitants. BACKGROUND: Patients with history of active malignancy are at increased risk of infection and COVID-19 related complications. Sanitary protection measures are not specifically recommended within household. We wanted to study the risk of seroconversion in cancer patients according to their household exposure., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The seroprevalence study is a prevalence study in Torrejon de Ardoz (Spain), and analyzed the seeroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies in 104,299 volunteers (participation rate of 74.8% of population) from May 29th to June 5th, 2020. Personal authorization was requested to collect by questionnaire the test result from cancer patients who attended the outpatients department of the University Hospital of Torrejon and their cohabitants between June 1 st and June 19th 2020., RESULTS: 229 cancer patients were included in the study. Sixty-four of the 229 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (27.9%) and 22 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies (9.6%). The overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) was 31.4% (general population seroprevalence was of 10% in Spain). Of 72 seropositive patients, 54.2% had intrafamilial exposure vs 45.8% did not. Among seronegative patients, 30.6% had seropositive cohabitants. The probability of seropositivity for a cancer patient was significantly related to intrafamilial exposure (OR of 2.684, 95% CI 1.51 - 4.76, p = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and could need to implement recommendations against virus transmission even in a household scenario as it is the main factor significantly related to seroconversion.

0	COVID-19 as an independent risk factor for subclinical placental dysfunction. BACKGROUND: The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions around the world. In pregnancy the dangers to the mother and fetus are still being explored. SARS-CoV2 can potentially compromise maternal and neonatal outcomes and this may be dependent on the pregnancy stage during which the infection occurs., OBJECTIVE: The present study was done to find the histopathological alterations in the placenta of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies with either no symptoms or mild coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 related symptoms and its association with neonatal outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective analytical study. Twenty seven asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy delivered between 1st July 2020 and 15th September 2020, were included as cases. An equal number of SARS-CoV-2 negative singleton pregnancies matched for maternal and gestational age during the same period were included as controls. After delivery the histopathological examination of the placenta of these women was done and the findings recorded on a predesigned proforma based on the Amsterdam consensus criteria for evidence of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion changes., RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the cases and controls. The following features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) were significantly higher in the placentae of COVID-19 positive pregnancies: retroplacental hematomas (RPH), accelerated villous maturation (AVM), distal villous hyperplasia (DVH), atherosis, fibrinoid necrosis, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles (MHMA), vessel ectasia and persistence of intramural endovascular trophoblast (PIEVT). Fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) significantly associated with the positive pregnancies were chorioangiosis, thrombosis of the fetal chorionic plate (TFCP), intramural fibrin deposition (IMFD) and vascular ectasia. Additionally, perivillous fibrin deposition was also significantly higher in the placentae of cases. The percentage of spontaneously delivered women was comparable in the two groups. The sex and weight of the newborn and the number of live births were comparable between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, show evidence of placental injury at a microscopic level. Similar findings have been demonstrated in other studies too. This placental injury apparently does not lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. The extent of this injury in symptomatic cases of COVID-19 pregnancies and its consequences on the outcomes need to be analysed. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Deep vein thrombosis protocol optimization to minimize healthcare worker exposure in coronavirus disease-2019. Objective: There are no societal ultrasound (US) guidelines detailing appropriate patient selection for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) imaging in patients with COVID-19, nor are there protocol recommendations aimed at decreasing exposure time for US technologists. We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific protocol optimization recommendations limiting US technologist exposure while optimizing patient selection. Method(s): A novel two-pronged algorithm was implemented to limit the DVT US studies on patients with COVID-19 prospectively, which included direct physician communication with the care team and a COVID-19-specific imaging protocol was instated to reduce US technologist exposure. To assess the pretest risk of DVT, the sensitivity and specificity of serum D-dimer in 500-unit increments from 500 to 8000 ng/mL and a receiver operating characteristic curve to assess performance of serum D-dimer in predicting DVT was generated. Rates of DVT, pulmonary embolism, and scan times were compared using t-test and Fisher's exact test (before and after implementation of the protocol). Result(s): Direct physician communication resulted in cancellation or deferral of 72% of requested examinations in COVID-19-positive patients. A serum D-dimer of >4000 ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 70% (95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.86) for venous thromboembolism. Using the COVID-19-specific protocol, there was a significant (50%) decrease in the scan time (P <.0001) in comparison with the conventional protocol. Conclusion(s): A direct physician communication policy between imaging physician and referring physician resulted in deferral or cancellation of a majority of requested DVT US examinations. An abbreviated COVID-19-specific imaging protocol significantly decreased exposure time to the US technologist.Copyright © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery	false
0	Neutralization of viruses with European, South African, and United States SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins by convalescent sera and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies. The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein has raised concerns that recovered individuals may not be protected from reinfection and that current vaccines will become less effective. The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein. Serum specimens from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine neutralized D614G virus with titers that were on average 7-fold greater than convalescent sera. Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD. The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses were not more infectious than D614G on ACE2.293T cells in vitro but N501Y, an ACE2 contacting residue present in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and COH.20G/677H spike proteins caused higher affinity binding to ACE2, likely contributing to their increased transmissibility. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by primary infection and by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are likely to maintain protective efficacy against B.1.1.7 and most other variants but that the partial resistance of virus with the B.1.351 spike protein could render some individuals less well protected, supporting a rationale for the development of modified vaccines containing E484K.	false
0	Identification of Serum Prognostic Biomarkers of Severe COVID-19 by Quantitative Proteomic Approach. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented threat to humanity provoking global health concerns. Since the etio-pathogenesis of this illness is not fully characterized, the prognostic factors enabling treatment decisions have not been well documented. An accurate prediction of the disease progression can aid in appropriate patient categorization to determine the best treatment option. Here, we have introduced a proteomic approach utilizing data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) to identify the serum proteins closely associated with the prognosis of COVID-19. We observed 27 proteins to be differentially expressed between the cohorts of severely ill COVID-19 patients with adverse and favorable prognosis. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that 15 out of the 27 proteins might be regulated by cytokine signalling relevant to interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and their differential expression was possibly implicated in the systemic inflammatory response and cardiovascular disorders. We further evaluated the practical prognosticators for the clinical prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Subsequent ELISA analyses further uncovered that CHI3L1 and IGFALS could be potent prognostic markers with a high sensitivity. Our findings can help in formulating a diagnostic approach for accurately discriminating severe COVID-19 patients and provide appropriate treatment based on their predicted prognosis.	false
0	Immune cell residency in the nasal mucosa and COVID-19 severity across the age range. <h4>Summary</h4> Severe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) positively correlates with age (Centers for Disease Control), develops after progression of infection from the upper airway to the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and can worsen into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Shi et al., 2020). Why children seem to be less likely to develop severe disease remains unclear. As the nasal mucosa (NM) is the first site of contact and defense for respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 before dissemination to the LRT (Casadei and Salinas, 2019), we hypothesized that differences in this tissue across the age range may help explain the disparity in COVID-19 severity. To this end, we profiled NM samples across the lifespan in health and disease. We find that global transcriptomic changes including the expression of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors are not correlated with age or the novel virus type, since pediatric NM cells mount similar antiviral response to both SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza B. Rather, we find immune cell residency in NM decreases dramatically with age especially cells of the innate immune system. This includes a resident-memory-like T cell subset with antiviral properties. These observations give plausible biological explanation to the observed clinical differences in disease spectrum and provide a foundation for future experimental studies.	false
0	Classification of COVID-19 by Compressed Chest CT Image through Deep Learning on a Large Patients Cohort. Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has spread globally quickly, and has resulted in a large number of causalities and medical resources insufficiency in many countries. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is adopted as biopsy tool for confirmation of virus infection. However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost. We also applied our model on 48 asymptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that: (1) the positive rate of RT-PCR assay is 63.5% (687/1082). (2) 45.8% (22/48) of the RT-PCR assay is negative for asymptomatic patients, yet the accuracy of CT scans is 95.8%. The online detection system is available: http://212.64.70.65/covid .	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 on Urban Population Flow in China. The COVID-19 epidemic has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Thus, this sudden health incident has brought great risk and pressure to the city with dense population flow. A deep understanding of the migration characteristics and laws of the urban population in China will play a very positive role in the prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Based on Baidu location-based service (LBS) big data, using complex networks method and geographic visualization tools, this paper explores the spatial structure evolution of population flow network (PFN) in 368 cities of China under different traffic control situations. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze how the population flow across cities affects the spread of the epidemic. Our findings show that: (1) the scope of population flow is closely related to the administrative level of the city and the traffic control policies in various cities which adjust with the epidemic situation; The PFN mainly presents the hierarchical structure dominated by the urban hierarchy and the regional isolation structure adjacent to the geographical location.(2) through the analysis network topology structure of PFN, it is found that only the first stage has a large clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length, which conforms to the characteristics of small world network. The epidemic situation has a great impact on the network topology in other stages, and the network structure tends to be centralized. (3) The overall migration scale of the whole country decreased by 36.85% compared with the same period of last year's lunar calendar, and a further reduction of 78.52% in the nationwide traffic control stage after the festival. (4) Finally, based on the comparison of the effective distance and the spatial distance from the Wuhan to other destination cities, it is demonstrated that there is a higher correlation between the effective distance and the epidemic spread both in Hubei province and the whole country.	false

0	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in an Adolescent Nigerian Girl with COVID-19: A call for vigilance in Africa. Most reports of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) have come from Europe and North America. The paucity of reports in Africa is in contrast with the demographics of the series in New York, Paris and UK with children of African ancestry accounting for over 40%, of all cases of MIS-C. With the global trend of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry, enhanced surveillance and awareness for this syndrome in children with COVID-19 in Africa are therefore important. A case report of a 12-year old Nigerian girl with MIS-C is presented in line with the WHO global surveillance especially in areas were MIS-C is considered a rarity. This case report stimulates a call for vigilance and expanded effort at surveillance to promote early recognition and diagnosis of MIS-C in Nigeria and Africa. The favourable outcome and experience from this case will create awareness, expand knowledge, and support clinicians in Nigeria and the African continent in their approach to other potential cases.

0	COVID-19 pandemic distress among a sample of Italian psycho-oncologists: risk of isolation and loneliness. PURPOSE: To measure the prevalence and characteristics of distress and hope for the future among psycho-oncologists, who faced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency along with other healthcare workers., METHODS: A web-based study was conducted among members of the Italian Society of Psycho-Oncology between May 29 and June 5, 2020., RESULTS: A total of 237 members, aged 28-72 years, completed the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and HOPE questionnaires; 86.92% were female, 58.65% worked in hospitals, 21.10% were exposed to COVID-19, 11.39% experienced peritraumatic distress, and 3.38% had posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Peritraumatic distress was associated with living alone (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-8.13), using sleep remedies (AOR 3.79; 95% CI 1.41-10.21), and the perception of being avoided by family or friends because of work (AOR 2.69; 95% CI 1.02-7.11); high HOPE-Agency scores were associated with the absence of peritraumatic stress (AOR 0.40; 95% CI 0.16-0.96) after adjustment for age and sex., CONCLUSIONS: Psycho-oncologists showed greater resilience than other healthcare workers as they are trained to help others, but also to review their own values and behavior in light of stressful events. Of interest is the association between peritraumatic distress and social isolation, real or perceived. Healthcare institutions should pay attention to the mental well-being of their employees by promoting distress screening using simple tools such as the CPDI and implementing support interventions. Psycho-oncology associations should introduce policies aimed at developing a sense of social connectedness by providing an interactive system of orientation and scientific reference.	false
0	Lack of changes in preterm delivery and stillbirths during COVID-19 lockdown in a European region. Preliminary data in Europe have suggested a reduction in prematurity rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, implying that contingency measures could have an impact on prematurity rates. We designed a population-based prevalence proportion study to explore the potential link between national lockdown measures and a change in preterm births and stillbirths. Adjusted multivariate analyses did not show any decrease in preterm proportions during the lockdown period with respect to the whole prelockdown period or to the prelockdown comparison periods (2015-2019): 6.5% (95%CI 5.6-7.4), 6.6% (95%CI 6.5-6.8), and 6.2% (95%CI 5.7-6.7), respectively. Proportions of preterm live births did not change during lockdown when different gestational age categories were analyzed, nor when birthweight categories were considered. No differences in stillbirth rates among the different study periods were found: 0.33% (95%CI 0.04-0.61) during the lockdown period vs. 0.34% (95%CI 0.22-0.46) during the prelockdown comparison period (2015-2019). Conclusion: We did not find any link between prematurity and lockdown, nor between stillbirths and lockdown. Collaborative efforts are desirable to gather more data and additional evidence on this global health issue. What is Known: * Prematurity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. * Contingency measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on reducing prematurity rates. What is New: * Prematurity and stillbirth rates remained stable in Castilla-y-Leon, a Spanish region, during COVID-19 lockdown. * The role of behavioral patterns and sociocultural factors in the prevention of preterm birth as a result of lockdown measures remains a subject for debate.	false

On global scale, the current situation of pandemic is symptomatic of increased incidences of contagious diseases caused by pathogens. The faster spread of these diseases, in a moderately short timeframe, is threatening the overall population wellbeing and conceivably the economy. The inadequacy of conventional diagnostic tools in terms of time consuming and complex laboratory-based diagnosis process is a major challenge to medical care. In present era, the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) is in demand for fast detection of infectious diseases along with ""on-site"" results that are helpful in timely and early action for better treatment. In addition, POCT devices also play a crucial role in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases by offering real-time testing and lab quality microbial diagnosis within minutes. Timely diagnosis and further treatment optimization facilitate the containment of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Presently, efforts are being made to support such POCT by the technological development in the field of internet of medical things (IoMT). The IoMT offers wireless-based operation and connectivity of POCT devices with health expert and medical centre. In this review, the recently developed POC diagnostics integrated or future possibilities of integration with IoMT are discussed with focus on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, influenza A (H1N1), human papilloma virus (HPV), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronavirus (COVID-19). The IoMT-assisted POCT systems are capable enough to fill the gap between bioinformatics generation, big rapid analytics, and clinical validation. An optimized IoMT-assisted POCT will be useful in understanding the diseases progression, treatment decision, and evaluation of efficacy of prescribed therapy. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

0	The rate of COVID-19 and associated mortality after elective hip and knee arthroplasty prior to cessation of elective services in UK. AIMS: The primary aim was to assess the rate of postoperative COVID-19 following hip and knee arthroplasty performed in March 2020 in the UK. The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services., METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19., RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.	false
0	Exposure to Spoken Communication in Children With Cochlear Implants During the COVID-19 Lockdown. Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns in Ontario, Canada in the spring of 2020 created unprecedented changes in the lives of all children, including children with hearing loss., Objective: To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses., Design, Setting, and Participants: This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, >=80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method., Results: A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31)., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study indicate a clear association of COVID-19 lockdowns with a reduction in children's access to spoken communication.	false
0	Association between Implementation of a Universal Face Mask Policy for Healthcare Workers in a Health Care System & SARS-CoV-2 positivity testing rate in Healthcare Workers. OBJECTIVE: Examine the effect of a universal facemask policy for healthcare workers(HCW) and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity., METHODS: Daily number of symptomatic HCW tested, SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates, and HCW job-descriptions were collected pre and post Universal HCW facemask policy(March 26). Multiple change point regression was used to model positive-test-rate data. SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity rates were compared for pre-intervention, transition, post-intervention, and follow-up periods., RESULTS: Between March 12-August 10, 2020, 19.2% of HCW were symptomatic for COVID-19 and underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. A single change point was identified ~March 28-30(95% probability). Before the change point, the odds of a tested HCW having a positive result doubled every 4.5-7.5 days. Post-change-point, the odds of a tested HCW having a positive result halved every 10.5-13.5 days., CONCLUSIONS: Universal facemasks was associated with reducing HCW's risk of acquiring COVID-19.

0	HealthcareCOVID: A national cross-sectional observational study identifying risk factors for developing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in UK healthcare workers. Objective: To establish the prevalence, risk factors and implications of suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among healthcare workers in the United Kingdom (UK). Design(s): Cross-sectional observational study. Setting(s): UK-based primary and secondary care. Participant(s): Healthcare workers aged =18 years working between 1 February and 25 May 2020. Main Outcome Measure(s): A composite endpoint of laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, or self-isolation or hospitalisation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Of 6,152 eligible responses, the composite endpoint was present in 1,806 (29.4%) healthcare workers, of whom 49 (0.8%) were hospitalised, 459 (7.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1,776 (28.9%) reported self-isolation. Overall, between 11,870 and 21,158 days of self-isolation were required by the cohort, equalling approximately 71 to 127 working days lost per 1,000 working days. The strongest risk factor associated with the presence of the primary composite endpoint was increasing frequency of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE): 'Never' (reference), 'Rarely' (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, (95% confidence interval: [0.87-1.29])), 'Sometimes' (1.7 [1.37-2.10]), 'Often' (1.84 [1.28-2.63]), 'Always' (2.93, [1.75-5.06]). Additionally, several comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, and obesity); working in a 'doctors' role; using public transportation for work; regular contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; and lack of PPE were also associated with the presence of the primary endpoint. A total of 1,382 (22.5%) healthcare workers reported lacking access to PPE items while having clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Conclusion(s): Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was more common in healthcare workers than in the general population and is associated with significant workforce implications. Risk factors included inadequate PPE, which was reported by nearly a quarter of healthcare workers. Governments and policymakers must ensure adequate PPE is available as well as developing strategies to mitigate risk for high-risk healthcare workers during future COVID-19 waves.

0	"Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP): Environmental and Health Security Perspectives in the post COVID-19 Anthropocene. The present work summarizes the major research findings related to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) study of COVID-19 and puts forward a conceptual framework, termed as ""Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP)"" for implementation of WBE. SWEEP framework is likely to tackle few practical issues related to WBE and simultaneously proposes refinements to the approach for better outcome and efficiency to save precious lives around the globe. It is observed that the present pandemic offers an opportunity for SWEEP to get included in routine urban water management to put the humankind at front to stop such pandemic in future or at least be prepared to fight against it. With global collaboration, SWEEP can be fine-tuned to meet diverse needs, making the present and future generations resilient to future viral outbreaks. Recent WBE studies conducted to check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater revealed that raw sewage samples tested positive to PCR-based assays while the treated samples showed absence of viral titers. Moreover, the lockdown had a positive impact on decreasing the viral loading in sewage. The proposed SWEEP protocol has an advantage over testifying individuals for predicting the stage of pandemic.

0	A Novel Cause of Vulval Ulcers?. An 11-month-old girl presented with a four day history of fever and evolving necrotic ulcers on the labia majora. Six weeks prior to her hospital admission she had an unexplained 11 day history of fever. None of her family members were symptomatic. Clinical examination revealed four well demarcated, asymptomatic ulcers with necrotic eschar, on a background of prominent vulval erythema and oedema, on the outer labia majora and the perianal skin. She was tachycardic and hypotensive. Viral swabs were negative for HSV/VZV and the bacterial swabs revealed a growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa. The COVID-19 swabs were negative on three occasions. An ECHO and CT angiogram were performed on the basis of clinicopathological results, confirming prominent coronary artery ectasia. A diagnosis of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) was made.1 Treatment included a course of IV ceftriaxone and clindamycin, an oral course of aspirin, a single dose of IVIG and a 3 day course of IV methylprednisolone which was then switched to oral prednisolone. Within two days of initiation of the treatment the vulval erythema reduced and the ulcers were shallower. These continued to improve throughout admission. We present a novel paediatric case of PIMS-TS associated with vulval ulcers. It was felt that the positive bacterial skin swabs represented a superimposed infection rather than the primary cause as the steroid course would lead to deterioration of the clinical picture. Kawasaki disease would have triggered a more diffuse vulval inflammation rather than localised vulval changes. Reference: 1. Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health.

0	Perforated duodenal ulcer in a child with beta-thalassemia major taking iron chelation. An ultra-rare side effect?. We describe an 8-year-old male patient with a background of beta-thalassemia major presenting in shock, secondary to duodenal perforation, likely caused by iron chelation treatment with Exjade. He had initially presented with signs of sepsis, haemodynamic instability and tested positive for COVID-19 antibody, initially thought to be multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Description The patient was transferred to our tertiary paediatric hospital from a local district general hospital. He had a 24-h history of sudden-onset abdominal pain and malaise. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging had confirmed D1 perforation. He was resuscitated in the emergency department (ED) with 50 ml.kg-1 of crystalloid before being taken to theatre for an urgent laparotomy. A positive COVID-19 antibody test was undertaken by the transferring hospital, prior to theatre. The result of a rapid reverse-transcriptase SARS-CoV2 swab was unavailable, and the patient was treated as having a high likelihood of COVID-19. In theatre, 900 ml of bile-stained fluid was suctioned. The perforation was oversewn with an omental patch. He received a further 20 ml.kg-1 of fresh frozen plasma as volume resuscitation. He was transferred to PICU for postoperative ventilation and was extubated 48 h later and was treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and gastroenterology follow-up. Discussion The patient had beta-thalassemia major and received 4-weekly red cell transfusions. He was taking deferasirox (Exjade) iron-chelation medication 20 mg.kg-1 daily. He had no other medical history, took no other medication and was reportedly well prior to this admission. Exjade was suspected as the likely cause. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) as an uncommon side effect. We found two previous case reports of peptic ulceration in children [1, 2]. At the time of discharge, the haematologists had withheld the Exjade and were considering bone marrow transplant as a definitive treatment. The case was confounded by a COVID-19-positive antibody test and the results of a rapid reverse-transcriptase SARS-CoV2 test were unavailable. Transpiring during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took full precautions as per our hospital policy. This meant using our COVID-19 designated theatre and full personal protective equipment. Subsequent swabs confirmed that the patient had no intercurrent COVID-19 infection and the conjecture of a Kawasaki picture secondary to MIS-C was a misnomer.	false
0	Race, cytokines and depression. Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that racial discrimination and the perceived stress of racism have been associated with elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may serve as a biological risk factor for disparities in COVID- 19 cases and deaths in the US. Given the well-documented relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and major depression, the goal of the present study was to examine whether there were racial differences in the relationship between inflammation and major depression using a secondary analysis of an ethnically diverse dataset. Method(s): 121 subjects were recruited as part of a larger program of research investigating major depressive disorder (MDD) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). 46 were African American (21 healthy comparison subjects, 25 with MDD) and 75 were Caucasian (34 healthy comparison subjects, 41 with MDD). The final inclusion criterion for depressed subjects was a score of >=15 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Severity of depression was also assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression scale. In addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined in plasma/serum aliquots by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available Quantakine kits (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for human IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Between-group differences in CRP and serum cytokine levels were investigated using an ANCOVA adjusting for age, education, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index and diastolic blood pressure. Bivariate Pearson's correlation analyses using two-tailed tests were performed to examine associations between serum cytokines and depression severity. Result(s): In the non-depressed sample, African American participants had significantly higher levels of CRP and IL-6 than Caucasian participants (CRP: F =4.48, p = .04, df = 1, 46 ;IL-6: F=.9.33, p = .004, df = 1, 52). In the context of major depression, there was no difference between groups (CRP: F=.001, p = .973, df = 1,58); IL-6: F=.097, p = .757, df = 1, 64). Furthermore, IL-6 was not correlated with depression severity in African American participants (r = .14, p = .369) but was in Caucasian participants (r = .38, p = .001). Conclusion(s): The well-known relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and major depression may be moderatedby race due to high baseline levels of cytokines in African Americans. Based on the known literature, these elevations may be related to the stressful life events due to discriminatory experiences.	false
0	IL-6 serum levels predict severity and response to tocilizumab in COVID-19: An observational study. Background: Patients with coronavirus disaese 2019 (COVID-19) can develop a cytokine release syndrome that eventually leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Because IL-6 is a relevant cytokine in acute respiratory distress syndrome, the blockade of its receptor with tocilizumab (TCZ) could reduce mortality and/or morbidity in severe COVID-19. Objective(s): We sought to determine whether baseline IL-6 serum levels can predict the need for IMV and the response to TCZ. Method(s): A retrospective observational study was performed in hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with preadministration and postadministration of TCZ. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, or mortality. Result(s): One hundred forty-six patients were studied, predominantly males (66%); median age was 63 years. Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ. IL-6 levels greater than 30 pg/mL was the best predictor for IMV (odds ratio, 7.1; P < .001). Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement in oxygenation (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio) in patients with high IL-6 (P = .048). Patients with high IL-6 not treated with TCZ showed high mortality (hazard ratio, 4.6; P = .003), as well as those with low IL-6 treated with TCZ (hazard ratio, 3.6; P = .016). No relevant serious adverse events were observed in TCZ-treated patients. Conclusion(s): Baseline IL-6 greater than 30 pg/mL predicts IMV requirement in patients with COVID-19 and contributes to establish an adequate indication for TCZ administration.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology	false

0	Systemic inflammation as fuel for acute liver injury in COVID-19. Background: A cytokine storm conceivably contributes to manifestations of corona virus disease (COVID19). Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause acute liver injury while serum detectability indicates systemic inflammation. Aims: We explored a link between systemic IL-6, related acute phase proteins and liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: 655 patients with suspected COVID-19 were screened in the emergency department at the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria, between February and April 2020. 96 patients (similar to 15%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. 15 patients required intensive-care treatment (ICT). Plasma aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transferase, as well as IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined by standard clinical assays. Results: Of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 41 (42%) showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration. COVID-19 patients with elevated AST exhibited significantly higher IL-6 (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001), LDH (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.05) serum concentrations compared to patients with normal AST. Liver injury correlated with systemic IL-6 (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001) and LDH (p < 0.001) concentration. In COVID-19 patients requiring ICT, correlations were more pronounced.

0	Factors associated with the spatial heterogeneity of the first wave of COVID-19 in France: a nationwide geo-epidemiological study. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to better understand the factors associated with the heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 morbidity and mortality across France, one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic., METHODS: This geo-epidemiological analysis was based on data publicly available on government and administration websites for the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France between March 19 and May 11, 2020, including Public Health France, the Regional Health Agencies, the French national statistics institute, and the Ministry of Health. Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100 000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases., FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100 988 COVID-19 cases, including 16 597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17 062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (range 19.4-489.5), in-hospital mortality rate of 26.3 deaths per 100 000 (1.1-119.2), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16.9% (4.8-26.2). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1.04, 1.02-1.06), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1.01, 1.01-1.02). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2.17 [95% CI 1.20-3.90] for mortality and 1.43 [1.08-1.88] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1.0004, 1.0002-1.001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates., INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere., FUNDING: None.

Background: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are unclear, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa. We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions in South Africa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV-status and underlying comorbidities on in-hospital COVID-19 mortality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July. Among the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In addition, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of multiple comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: These data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention programmes, as well as early referral and treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: DATCOV is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African National Government. No additional funding was obtained towards the completion of this analysis and the development of this manuscript.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical), University of the Witwatersrand, approved the project protocol as part of a national surveillance program (M160667). This activity was reviewed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

0	Clinical Characteristics of Severe COVID-19 in China: A Case Series and Meta-analysis. <h4>Background: </h4> There have been inconsistent reports regarding the unique manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring in China. This study analyzed the clinical manifestation of 13 severe COVID-19 cases at a single institution and compared the data to previously reported characteristics of severe COVID-19 in China. <h4>Methods: </h4> This retrospective case study included patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the Shandong Chest Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020. The clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory examination results, imaging features, treatment strategies, and patient prognoses were summarized. A database search was then conducted for studies published through December 2020 documenting characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases in China. The pooled results for severe COVID-19 patients in China were calculated by using the random-effects model. <h4>Results: </h4>: A total of 4 severe and 9 critical patients were included from Shandong Chest Hospital. The average patient age was 55.3 (range 23-88) years, and 61.5% of patients were male. Chest computed tomography for all patients showed multiple lesions as ground-glass shadows in both lungs. All patients presented bacterial infection and various degrees of liver and myocardial injury. The treatment strategies for patients included antibiotics, immunoglobulin, and glucocorticoids, and mechanical ventilation was used in all patients for respiratory failure. Two patients died, and 11 recovered. In the pooled data for severe COVID-19 patients, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. The common signs in these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and a leukocyte count > 10. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Older males with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Patients should be assessed for concomitant bacterial infections. Cardiac and liver enzymes, fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and leukocytosis should be monitored for signs of disease progression.	false
0	The promise of direct-to-consumer COVID-19 testing: ethical and regulatory issues. Widespread diagnostic and serological (antibody) testing is one key to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. While at first, the majority of COVID-19 diagnostic testing in the USA took place in healthcare settings, quickly a direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing market also emerged. In these DTC provision models, the test is initiated by a consumer and the sample collection occurs at home or in a commercial laboratory. Although the provision of DTC tests has potential benefits-such as expanding access to testing and reducing the risk of exposure for consumers and medical personnel-it also raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns. This article reviews these challenges and shows how they parallel and also diverge from prior concerns raised in the DTC health testing arena. The first part of this paper provides an overview of the landscape of diagnostic and serological tests for COVID-19, anticipating how provision models are likely to evolve in the future. The second part discusses five primary issues for DTC COVID-19 tests: test accuracy; potential misinterpretation of results; misleading claims and other misinformation; privacy concerns; and fair allocation of scarce resources. We conclude with recommendations for regulators and companies that aim to ensure ethically marketed DTC COVID-19 tests. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	90 Placental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies from mothers to newborns. Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds with its spike (S) protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding domain. S-specific antibodies (Abs) induce a robust immunologic response and several studies have shown that previously infected individuals have high titers of Abs against this protein. Placental transfer of Abs is generally dependent on the specific Abs concentration, subtype, Fc glycan profile, antigen specificity and gestational age. Given the novelty of this viral disease, little is known about the immunologic response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2. We aim to assess and quantify the transfer of S-specific Abs from mothers to infants, by using paired maternal and cord blood samples. Study Design: The concentration of S-specific IgG Abs was assayed by ELISA in plasma of previously recruited, SARS-CoV-2 seropositive pregnant women. Samples were collected from peripheral blood during admission for delivery and from cord blood at the time of delivery. Result(s): We enrolled 33 women in the study. Of these, 20/33 (60.6%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of admission for delivery, and 13/33 (39.4%) were diagnosed at least 7 days before delivery; 17/33 (51.5%) were asymptomatic and 16/33 (48.5%) were symptomatic. There is transfer of S-specific IgG Abs through placenta. The concentration of S-specific Abs was slightly higher on log10 end point dilution for mothers that had tested positive at least 7 days before delivery when compared to those tested positive at time of delivery. The concentration of Abs for asymptomatic mothers was lower than for those that presented symptoms. These trends were also seen in newborns for each respective group. Conclusion(s): There is transfer of S-specific IgG Abs from mothers to newborns. Transfer appears to be dependent on timing of infection and severity of disease. Patients infected at an earlier gestational age and with clinical symptoms transfer more Abs to their newborns. Studies to examine the functionality of the Abs are in progress.Copyright © 2019	false
0	A Covid-19 Patient with Complement-Mediated Coagulopathy and Severe Thrombosis. We report a patient with severe Covid-19-associated coagulopathy and type 2 diabetes mellitus who tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Analysis of skin specimens suggested direct SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced and complement-mediated vascular injury and thrombosis, consistent with prior reports. Serial aPL testing demonstrated high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) that declined to insignificant levels over a period of 5 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swab specimens on serial assays performed over the same 5-week period, though it was not detected thereafter. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced aPL contributed to severe Covid-19-associated coagulopathy in this patient.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Carboxypeptidase B blocks ex vivo activation of the anaphylatoxin-neutrophil extracellular trap axis in neutrophils from COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Thrombosis and coagulopathy are highly prevalent in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and increase the risk of death. Immunothrombosis has recently been demonstrated to contribute to the thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy. As the primary components of immunothrombosis, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could be induced by complement cascade components and other proinflammatory mediators. We aimed to explore the clinical roles of NETs and the regulation of complement on the NET formation in COVID-19., METHODS: We recruited 135 COVID-19 patients and measured plasma levels of C5, C3, cell-free DNA and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA. Besides, the formation of NETs was detected by immunofluorescent staining and the cytotoxicity to vascular endothelial HUVEC cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay., RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of complements C3 and MPO-DNA were positively related to coagulation indicator fibrin(-ogen) degradation products (C3: r = 0.300, p = 0.005; MPO-DNA: r = 0.316, p = 0.002) in COVID-19 patients. Besides, C3 was positively related to direct bilirubin (r = 0.303, p = 0.004) and total bilirubin (r = 0.304, p = 0.005), MPO-DNA was positively related to lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.306, p = 0.003) and creatine kinase (r = 0.308, p = 0.004). By using anti-C3a and anti-C5a antibodies, we revealed that the complement component anaphylatoxins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients strongly induced NET formation. The pathological effect of the anaphylatoxin-NET axis on the damage of vascular endothelial cells could be relieved by recombinant carboxypeptidase B (CPB), a stable homolog of enzyme CPB2 which can degrade anaphylatoxins to inactive products., CONCLUSIONS: Over-activation in anaphylatoxin-NET axis plays a pathological role in COVID-19. Early intervention in anaphylatoxins might help prevent thrombosis and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	A Review of Coronary Artery Thrombosis: A New Challenging Finding in COVID-19 Patients and ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more information on the nonrespiratory effects of the coronavirus is obtained. Cardiovascular complications, especially acute coronary syndromes, are rare. However, they prove to be effective factors in the mortality rate of COVID-19 subjects. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a special angiographic pattern in the form of extensive and multivessel thrombosis, regardless of atherosclerotic plaques, has posed a new therapeutic challenge. This has been associated with an increase in the incidence of stent thrombosis. Hypercoagulation, due to severe inflammation, is the main pathology of this phenomenon. Technically, percutaneous coronary intervention with aspiration thrombectomy and injectable antiplatelet are the mainstay of treatment for these patients. In addition, it is vital that appropriate antiplatelet and ischemia treatment after the intervention be taken into account.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with high-titer convalescent plasma. We are reporting on a phase IIa study which aimed to determine the intubation rate, survival, viral clearance, and the development of endogenous antibodies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with convalescent plasma (CCP) containing high levels of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All 51 treated patients had COVID-19 pneumonia by radiographic and laboratory evaluation. Fresh or frozen CCP from donors with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was administered. The non-mechanically ventilated patients (n=36) had an intubation rate of 13.9% and a day-30 survival of 88.9%. The overall survival for a comparative group based on network data was 72.5% (1625/2241). Patients had rates of negative nasopharyngeal swab on day +10 and +30 of 43.8% and 73% respectively. Patients mechanically ventilated had a day-30 mortality of 46.7%; the mortality for a comparative group based on network data was 71% (369/520). All evaluable patients were found to have neutralizing antibodies on day +3 (n=47), and all but 1 had antibodies on day +30 and +60. The only adverse event was a mild rash. We are concluding that in this study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, CCP was safe and conferred transfer of antibodies while preserving endogenous immune response.	false
0	Back to the basics: Study of portable chest radiographic findings in 116 COVID-19 positive patients in an Indian tertiary care hospital. Context: Paucity of literature of portable CXR findings in COVID-19. Aim(s): Evaluate radiographic findings in COVID-19 patients and calculate sensitivity of radiographs with RT-PCR as gold standard. Subjects and Methods: Total 116 COVID-19 patients underwent portable CXR between April-June, 2020. Two radiologists reviewed radiographs with respect to laterality, craniocaudal, mediolateral distribution, shape, density, unifocality/multifocality and number of lung zones. Sensitivity of radiography was calculated with RT-PCR as gold standard. Statistical Analysis Used: IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription software (IBM, New York, USA). Result(s): Many patients 67.2% (78/116) were asymptomatic. Cough (21.5%, 25/116) and fever (17.6%, 20/116) were the most frequent symptoms. 36.2% (42/116) patients revealed COVID-19 pneumonia-like abnormalities on CXR. Sensitivity of CXR with RT-PCR as gold standard was 36.2% (CI: Confidence interval = 27.46% - 44.95%). More patients in symptomatic group (68.4%, 26/38) had abnormal CXR compared to asymptomatic group (20.5%, 16/78) [P < 0.0001]. Radiographs revealed both unilateral (57.1%, 24/42), bilateral (42.8%, 18/42), GGO (80.9%, 34/42), or consolidation (11/42, 26.1%) in a middle (57.1%, 24/42), lower zone (83.3%, 35/42) and peripheral distribution (78.5%, 33/42). Lesions were commonly patchy (88%, 37/42) and multifocal (59.5%, 25/42). Majority had single (40.4%, 17/42) or two zone (35.7%, 15/42) involvement. Conclusion(s): Significant number of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. Over 1/3rd of patients showed radiographic abnormalities. Symptomatic patients were more likely to show radiographic findings than asymptomatic patients. If radiographs identify pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting, CT can be avoided. Common radiographic abnormalities among COVID 19 patients were bilateral/unilateral, patchy, multifocal, ground glass opacity or consolidation in peripheral and middle/lower zone distribution.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Instead of delivering antigenic proteins directly, an mRNA-based vaccine relies on the host's cells to manufacture protein immunogens which, in turn, are targets for antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses. mRNA-based vaccines have been the subject of research for over three decades as a platform to protect against or treat a variety of cancers, amyloidosis and infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss mRNA-based approaches for the generation of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines to HIV. We examine the special immunological hurdles for a vaccine to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and effective T cell responses to HIV. Lastly, we outline an mRNA-based HIV vaccination strategy based on the immunobiology of broadly neutralizing antibody development.	false
0	Interferons and other cytokines, genetics and beyond in COVID-19 and autoimmunity. Interferons are the best antiviral agents in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 so far and genetic defects in their signaling cascade or neutralization of alfa-interferons by autoantibodies come with more severe COVID-19. However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	Clinical correlation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 cases in selected districts of Uttar Pradesh: A cross-sectional hospital-based study. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (CoV) has resulted in a global pandemic despite drastic measures to avoid contagious spread. On April 3, 2020, there were around 1 million reported cases and 51,515 deaths due to CoV disease 2019. The disease presents with flu-like symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue. India being a resource-limited country, it is very important to differentiate the suspected cases clinically., AIM: The aim was to know the correlation of various clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected cases in selected districts of UP., SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective cross-sectional hospital-based study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study performed on 1243 suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 25, 2020 to April 17, 2020 in the department of microbiology of our institute to know the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in selected districts of Uttar Pradesh. These cases were analyzed to see the association of various clinical symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For statistical analysis, Pearson's Chi-square test was performed using SPSS version 23., RESULTS: Out of total suspected cases, 4.5% were positive. Travel history was present in 80.4% of positive cases. About 83.9% had fever, 28.6% had shortness of breath, 35.7% had dry cough, 17.9% had either Type I or II diabetes mellitus, 12.5% had chronic kidney disease, and 7.1% had obstructive pulmonary diseases., CONCLUSION: Negative clinical history is very important in ruling out the suspected cases who came out to be free from the infection.

0	Lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic in Italy - A commentary. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Italy has been one of the most affected countries in Europe and the second for number of deaths. In this commentary, we discuss some lessons that we learned as health-care providers working in a large public hospital during the pandemic, with a special focus on the importance of infection containment and early diagnosis, the role of swab, serological tests, home isolation and individual protection devices, and the available therapies and management indications to better face a possible new outbreak in the near future. These comments should stimulate a more diffused, efficient, and efficacious management of COVID-19 patients, also reducing the number of admissions to hospital emergency departments and the related spread of the infection.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak and the emergency public health measures in Bosnia and Herzegovina: January - July, 2020. Between March 5th and July 25th, 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was 10,090, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 285.7/100,000 population. Demographic and clinical information on all the cases along with exposure and contact information were collected using a standardized case report form. In suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, respiratory specimens were collected and tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. The dynamic of the outbreak was summarized using epidemiological curves, instantaneous reproduction number Rt, and interactive choropleth maps for geographical distribution and spread. The rate of hospitalization was 14.0%(790/5646) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) and 6.2% (267/4299) in the Republic of Srpska (RS). The death rate was 2.2% (122/5646) in FBH and 3.6% in the RS (155/4299). After the authorities lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions, the instantaneous reproduction number increased from 1.13 on May 20th to 1.72 on May 31st. The outbreak concerns both entities, FBH and RS, and it is more pronounced in those aged 20-44years. It is important to develop the communication and emergency plan for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in BH, including the mechanisms to allow the ongoing notification and updates at the national level.	false
0	Peginterferon lambda for the treatment of outpatients with COVID-19: a phase 2, placebo-controlled randomised trial. BACKGROUND: To date, only monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective for outpatients with COVID-19. Interferon lambda-1 is a type III interferon involved in innate antiviral responses with activity against respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon lambda in the treatment of outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19., METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 mug or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation list created with a randomisation schedule in blocks of four. At the time of administration, study nurses received a sealed opaque envelope with the treatment allocation number. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on day 7 after the injection, analysed by a chi2 test following an intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, adjusted for baseline viral load, using bivariate logistic regression was done. The trial is now complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354259., FINDINGS: Between May 18, and Sept 4, 2020, we recruited 30 patients per group. The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2.42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0.0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0.15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4.12 [95% CI 1.15-16.73; p=0.029). Of those with baseline viral load above 106 copies per mL, 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the peginterferon lambda group had undetectable virus on day 7, compared with six (38%) of 16 in the placebo group (OR 6.25 [95% CI 1.49-31.06]; p=0.012). Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group. Two individuals met the threshold of grade 3 increase, one in each group, and no other grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were reported., INTERPRETATION: Peginterferon lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19, increasing the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, particularly in those with high baseline viral load. Peginterferon lambda has potential to prevent clinical deterioration and shorten duration of viral shedding., FUNDING: The Toronto COVID-19 Action Initiative, University of Toronto, and the Ontario First COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation.

0	Olfactory dysfunction: A clinical marker of COVID-19. Due to the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many health systems worldwide are overwhelmed, leading to the triggering of the scarcity of medical resources. The identification of indicators that re-quire hospital admission help in the efficient allocation of medical resources. Olfactory impairment is also one of the indicators of COVID-19 infection. Many studies have analyzed olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 with a variable prevalence rate but underreporting of this problem is very much likely as the problem is considered benign. Many scientific societies have stated that olfactory dysfunction is a frequent symptom of COVID-19 and have published recommendations for it.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2018.	false
0	Reaction of Human Monoclonal Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Proteins With Tissue Antigens: Implications for Autoimmune Diseases. We sought to determine whether immune reactivity occurs between anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein antibodies and human tissue antigens, and whether molecular mimicry between COVID-19 viral proteins and human tissues could be the cause. We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.© Copyright © 2021 Vojdani, Vojdani and Kharrazian.	false
0	Decreased incidence of enterovirus and norovirus infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, Victoria, Australia, 2020. Abstract: Significant reductions in the incidence of enteroviruses and noroviruses, both transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route, were noted in 2020 compared to the previous decade, in Victoria, Australia. The enterovirus specimen positivity rate was reduced by 84.2% in 2020, while the norovirus outbreak positivity rate declined by 49.0%. The most likely explanation for these reductions is the concurrence of social restrictions, physical distancing, personal hygiene awareness and international and domestic border closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Who suffered most after deaths due to COVID-19? Prevalence and correlates of prolonged grief disorder in COVID-19 related bereaved adults. BACKGROUND: Deaths by COVID-19 have left behind nearly 12 million recent bereaved individuals worldwide and researchers have raised concerns that the circumstances of COVID-19 related deaths will lead to a rise prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) cases. However, to date, no studies have examined the prevalence of PGD among people bereaved due to COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PGD and investigated demographic and loss-related factors associated with prolonged grief symptoms among Chinese individuals bereaved due to COVID-19., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted between September 1 and October 3, 2020. A total of 422 Chinese participants (55.5% males; 32.73 [9.31] years old) who lost a close person due to COVID-19 participated in the study. Demographic and loss-related information was collected, and self-reported prolonged grief symptoms were measured by a 13-item International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (IPGDS: 1-65) and a 17-item Traumatic Grief Inventory Self Report (TGI-SR: 1-85). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the associated factors of levels of grief symptoms., RESULTS: Prevalence of PGD was 37.8% screened by IPGDS and 29.3% by TGI-SR. No difference was found in levels of grief symptoms between participants whose close one died more than 6 months ago and those who experienced the loss less than 6 months ago. More severe prolonged grief symptoms assessed by IPGDS was associated with losing a close person by COVID-19 rather than complications (B: 5.35; 95% CI: 0.54-10.05), losing a partner (B: 7.80; 95% CI: 3.24-12.37), child (B: 8.15; 95% CI: 1.03-15.26), and parent (B: 5.49; 95% CI: 1.49-9.48) rather than losing a relative or a person with other relationship, feeling more traumatic about the loss (B: 1.71; 95% CI: 0.52-2.90), being closer with the deceased (B: 1.60; 95% CI: 0.34-2.86). Moreover, Losing a grandparent (B: 6.62; 95% CI: 0.53-12.71) and having more conflicts with the deceased (B: 1.05; 95% CI: - 0.008-2.11) were related to higher levels of grief symptoms assessed by TGI-SR., CONCLUSIONS: Echoing researchers' concerns, the prevalence of PGD is high among people bereaved due to COVID-19. Individuals with a higher risk of developing PGD should be identified and bereavement support should be offered as early as possible.	false
0	Are RNA-Based Tests Sufficient for COVID-19 Diagnosis? An Inspiration of Three Asymptomatic Cases. In this work, we discovered a new phenomenon-asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, or covert case, during the pandemic. All the 3 patients had a history of exposure, with no symptoms, and no abnormalities were found in computed tomography scan or lab tests. Except for case 2, the other patients' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) nucleic acid tests were negative. But their anti-SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid antibody showed a dynamic trend, consistent with the process of virus infection and clearance. A growing number of asymptomatic or covert cases need more attention. Lack of surveillance may lead to another outbreak. We hope to demonstrate our cases to attract the attention of governments or health authorities that covert cases should be the focus as well.	false
0	Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a male with metabolic syndrome for 72 days: A case report. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, and spread gradually throughout the world. There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, such findings have not been documented in Bangladesh. Herein, we present a case of metabolic syndrome that remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over a prolonged period. On clinical and laboratory examination, the patient was diagnosed with obesity, raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and uncontrolled glycemia. However, upon taking appropriate measures and controlling the plasma sugar level, he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the 72nd day since illness onset. We observed that COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, may shed the virus over a prolonged period. Therefore, strict public health measures and isolation rules should be followed by a high-risk population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	Viral pneumonia. About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year - 100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Optical Tracking of the Interfacial Dynamics of Single SARS-CoV-2 Pseudoviruses. The frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in healthcare environments, accommodations, and wastewater has attracted great attention to the risk of viral transmission by environmental fomites. However, the process of SARS-CoV-2 adsorption to exposed surfaces in high-risk environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the interfacial dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with plasmonic imaging technology. Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Such information is valuable for understanding virus transport and environmental transmission and even for designing anticontamination surfaces.	false
0	[Learning while studying dentistry]. The aim of the present study was to gain a better understanding of the significance, use and prevalence of digital as well as analog learning and teaching aids within dentistry studies at the University Center of Dental Medicine Basel (UZB) regarding sociodemographic aspects. A questionnaire was distributed among the three upper years of dental students at the UZB in the autumn semester before the corona pandemic. The results showed that all students use digital devices. The most often used devices in connection with academic studies were portable devices such as laptops or smartphones. It is to mention that students younger than 25 years used smartphones more often as learning aids than their older classmates. The devices were used on average 57 % of the total daily use time for study purposes, whereas private usage time decreased with age and progression of studies. In order to acquire theoretical knowledge, analog and digital formats were equally important. Digital learning aids were mainly used as digitalized lecture notes or for internet research. Advantages were especially seen in timesaving and organizational aspects. The analog learning aids were appreciated for their better learning and less tiring effect. The high prevalence and usage of mobile internet connectable devices as well as the high availability of the internet may indicate a tendency toward mobile learning.	false
0	COVID-19 infection in pediatric subjects: study of 36 cases in Conakry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the main clinical and evolutionary features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children aged 0-18 years who were suspected and diagnosed for COVID-19 during routine consultations in the pediatric ward of the Ignace Deen National Hospital in Conakry. This retrospective study targeted all children admitted to the Pediatrics Department during the study period and focused on children whose clinical examination and/or history indicated a suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only children with a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were included. Clinical and paraclinical data were rigorously analyzed. Anonymity and respect for ethical rules were the norm. Medical records were used as the data source and a questionnaire was developed for collection. The analysis was done using STATA/SE version 11.2 software. The mean age of the patients observed was 9.66+/-1.32 years, with a sex ratio of 1.25. The history of the patients found that 36.11 had already been in contact with a COVID-19 positive subject, of which 8 or 22 had close relatives treated for COVID-19 and 5 had been with classmates treated for COVID-19. Fever and physical asthenia, runny nose and throat pain were respectively found in 58.33%, 50% and 30.55% of patients with irritability in 25%. Asymptomatic children were 30.55%. The diagnosis was confirmed after a positive RT-PCR test. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan was normal in 80.55% of the children. They were given mostly azithromycin 15mg/kg, zinc and chloroquine sulfate 5mg/kg. The mean age of the patients observed was 9.66 years, with a sex ratio of 1.25.

0	High-level expression of the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD 320-537 in stably transfected CHO cells by the EEF1A1-based plasmid vector. The spike (S) protein is one of the three proteins forming the coronaviruses' viral envelope. The S protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a spatial structure similar to the S proteins of other mammalian coronaviruses, except for a unique receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a significant inducer of host immune response. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD is widely used as a highly specific minimal antigen for serological tests. Correct exposure of antigenic determinants has a significant impact on the accuracy of such tests-the antigen has to be correctly folded, contain no potentially antigenic non-vertebrate glycans, and, preferably, should have a glycosylation pattern similar to the native S protein. Based on the previously developed p1.1 vector, containing the regulatory sequences of the Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EEF1A1) from Chinese hamster, we created two expression constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tags. RBDv1 contained a native viral signal peptide, RBDv2 -human tPA signal peptide. We transfected a CHO DG44 cell line, selected stably transfected cells, and performed a few rounds of methotrexate-driven amplification of the genetic cassette in the genome. For the RBDv2 variant, a high-yield clonal producer cell line was obtained. We developed a simple purification scheme that consistently yielded up to 30 mg of RBD protein per liter of the simple shake flask cell culture. Purified proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing and non-reducing conditions and gel filtration; for RBDv2 protein, the monomeric form content exceeded 90% for several series. Deglycosylation with PNGase F and mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of N-glycosylation. The antigen produced by the described technique is suitable for serological tests and subunit vaccine studies.Copyright © 2021 Sinegubova et al.

0	Common hematological values predict unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Early identification of patients who will develop severe disease is crucial. A number of scores and indexes have been developed to predict severity. However, most rely on measurements not readily available. We evaluated hematological and biochemical markers taken on admission and determined how predictive they were of development of critical illness or death. We observed that higher values of readily available tests, including neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio; derived neutrophil index; and troponin I were associated with a higher risk of death or critical care admission (P < 0.001). We show that common hematological tests can be helpful in determining early in the course of illness which patients are likely to develop severe forms, as well as allocating resources to those patients early, while avoiding overuse of limited resources in patients with reduced risk of progression to severe disease.Copyright © 2021	false
0	Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States. As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	false
0	Usability of saliva collection devices for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. There is an urgent need to expand testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens as the global community struggles to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Current diagnostic methods can be affected by supply chain bottlenecks and require the assistance of medical professionals, impeding the implementation of large-scale testing. Self-collection of saliva may solve these problems because it can be completed without specialized training and uses generic materials. In this study, we observed thirty individuals who self-collected saliva using four different collection devices and analyzed their feedback. These devices enabled the safe collection of saliva that was acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.	false
0	Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests with different antigen targets. Background: These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests available in April 2020 in Switzerland. Methods: In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other viruses. Results: In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, five had a sensitivity and specificity above 90 % and 98 % respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no test showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response. Conclusions: The majority of the evaluated tests exhibited high performances of IgG/pan-Ig sensitivity and specificity to detect the serological response of moderately to critically ill hospitalized patients. The IgM and IgA tests showed mostly insufficient performances with no added value for the early diagnostic on the cohort tested in this study.	false

0	Acute kidney injury in patients with Covid-19 in a Brazilian ICU: incidence, predictors and in-hospital mortality. INTRODUCTION: There is little data in the literature on acute kidney injury (AKI) in Covid-19 cases, although relevant in clinical practice in the ICU, especially in Brazil. Our goal was to identify the incidence of AKI, predictive factors and impact on hospital mortality., METHOD: Retrospective cohort of patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ICU. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Data was collected from electronic medical records between March 17 and April 26., RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 55.9% progressed with AKI, and the majority (66.7%) was classified as stage 3. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. Twenty-three patients died. In the group without kidney injury, there were 8.9% deaths, while in the group with AKI, 33.3% of patients died (RR 5.125; 95% CI 1.598 - 16.431; p = 0.0060). The average survival, in days, was higher in the group without AKI. Cox multivariate analysis showed age (RR 1.054; 95% CI 1.014 - 1.095; p = 0.0080) and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR 8.953; 95% CI 1.128 - 71.048; p = 0.0380) as predictors of hospital mortality., CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of AKI; and as predictive factors for its occurrence: age, eGFR and hypertension. AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality.	false
0	Efficacy of Copeptin in Distinguishing COVID-19 Pneumonia from Community-Acquired Pneumonia. The clinical symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia are similar. Effective predictive markers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from CAP in the current pandemic conditions. Copeptin, a 39-aminoacid glycopeptide, is a C-terminal part of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). The activation of the AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aims to determine serum copeptin levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze the power of copeptin in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia. The study consists of 98 patients with COVID-19 and 44 patients with CAP. The basic demographic and clinical data of all patients were recorded, and blood samples were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to CAP patients (10.2+/-4.4 ng/mL & 7.1+/-3.1 ng/mL; p<0.001). Serum copeptin levels were positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet count (r=-0.21, p=0.012; r=-0.21, p=0.013; r=-0.20, p=0.018; respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased copeptin (OR=1.183, 95%CI, 1.033-1.354; p=0.015) and CK-MB (OR=1.052, 95%CI, 1.013-1.092; p=0.008) levels and decreased leukocyte count (OR=0.829, 95%CI, 0.730-0.940; p=0.004) were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off value of 6.83 ng/mL for copeptin predicted COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 73% (AUC:0.764 %95Cl:0.671-0.856, p<0.001). Copeptin could be a promising and useful biomarker to be used to distinguish COVID-19 patients from CAP patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Oral Complications of ICU Patients with COVID-19: Case-Series and Review of Two Hundred Ten Cases. BACKGROUND: The critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) are susceptible to a wide array of complications that can be life-threatening or impose them to long-term complications. The COVID-19 oral mucocutaneous complications require multidisciplinary management and research for their pathophysiological course and epidemiological significance; therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of the critically ill COVID-19 patients with oral complications., METHODS: We described the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the critically ill COVID-19 patients in our ICU department (Banska Bystrica, Slovakia). In addition, we reviewed the current body of evidence in Ovid MEDLINE R, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for the oral mucocutaneous complications of ICU patients with COVID-19., RESULTS: Three out of nine critically ill patients (33.3%) in our ICU department presented with oral complications including haemorrhagic ulcers and necrotic ulcers affecting the lips and tongue. The microbiological assessment revealed the presence of opportunistic pathogens, confirming the possibility of co-infection. On reviewing the current literature, two hundred ten critically ill patients were reported to have oral complications due to their stay in the ICU setting. Perioral pressure ulcers were the most common complication, followed by oral candidiasis, herpetic and haemorrhagic ulcers, and acute onset macroglossia. The prolonged prone positioning and mechanical ventilation devices were the primary risk factors for those oral complications, in addition to the immunosuppressive drugs., CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary approach is strongly advocated for monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients, thus implying that dermatology and oral healthcare specialists and nurses should be integrated within the ICU teams.	false
0	Mucosal immunisation of African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) with an attenuated parainfluenza virus expressing the SARS coronavirus spike protein for the prevention of SARS. Background The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus - SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have developed an experimental SARS vaccine for direct immunisation of the respiratory tract, the major site of SARS- coronavirus transmission and disease. Methods We expressed the complete SARS coronavirus envelope spike (S) protein from a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3) that is being developed as a live attenuated, intranasal paediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). We immunised eight African green monkeys, four with a single dose of BHPIV3/ SARS-S and four with a control, BHPIV3/Ctrl, administered via the respiratory tract. A SARS-coronavirus challenge was given to all monkeys 28 days after immunisation. Findings Immunisation of animals with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibodies, indicating that a systemic immune response resulted from mucosal immunisation. After challenge with SARS coronavirus, all monkeys in the control group shed SARS coronavirus, with shedding lasting 5-8 days. No viral shedding occurred in the group immunised with BHPIV3/SARS-S. Interpretation A vectored mucosal vaccine expressing the SARS-coronavirus S protein alone may be highly effective in a single-dose format for the prevention of SARS.	false
0	In vitro evolution of Remdesivir resistance reveals genome plasticity of SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir (RDV) is used widely for COVID-19 patients despite varying results in recent clinical trials. Here, we show how serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV selected for drug-resistant viral populations. We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we also observed changes in the Spike (i.e., H69 E484, N501, H655) corresponding to mutations identified in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. This study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 genome plasticity and offers new perspectives on surveillance of viral variants.	false
0	No SARS-CoV-2 carriage observed in children attending daycare centers during the intial weeks of the epidemic in Belgium. To gain knowledge about the role of young children attending daycare in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, a random sample of children (n = 84) aged between 6 and 30 months attending daycare in Belgium was studied shortly after the start of the epidemic (February 29th) and before the lockdown (March 18th) by performing in-house SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction. No asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas common cold symptoms were common (51.2%). Our study shows that in Belgium, there was no sign of early introduction into daycare centers at the moment children being not yet isolated at home, although the virus was clearly circulating. It is clear that more evidence is needed to understand the actual role of young children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and their infection risk when attending daycare.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

0	Poor antigen-specific responses to the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals. The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> Immune responses to the booster dose of mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 are poor in subjects with a prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false

0	Renal dysfunction and prognosis of COVID-19 patients: a hospital-based retrospective cohort study. INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence indicate that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is companied by renal dysfunction. However, the association of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced renal dysfunction with prognosis remains obscure., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 154 patients with COVID-19 were recruited from the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City in Anhui, China. Demographic characteristics and laboratory data were extracted. Renal dysfunction was evaluated and its prognosis was followed up based on a retrospective cohort study., RESULTS: There were 125 (81.2%) mild and 29 (18.8%) severe cases in 154 COVID-19 patients. On admission, 16 (10.4%) subjects were accompanied with renal dysfunction. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was decreased in severe patients compared with those in mild patients. Renal dysfunction was more prevalent in severe patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that male gender, older age and hypertension were three importantly independent risk factors for renal dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Follow-up study found that at least one renal function marker of 3.33% patients remained abnormal in 2 weeks after discharge., CONCLUSION: Male elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension elevates the risk of renal dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2-induced renal dysfunction are not fully recovered in 2 weeks after discharge.	false

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in newborns is extremely rare, and there is a scarcity of research pertaining to epidemiology, clinical presentation, transmission, and prognosis in this population. We present five newborns who tested positive while colocating with their SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers from March 19 to May 15, 2020, at a large public hospital in Queens, New York that was severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. All the newborns subsequently tested negative and remained asymptomatic, including through median outpatient follow-up of three weeks. Copyright © 2021, Patil et al.	false
0	An Overview of the Ongoing Clinical Issues of COVID-19. Childhood cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the rise as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe. Most children acquire infection from an adult household member. Children may stay asymptomatic, have a pre-symptomatic stage, or present with symptoms (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing being the most common). Nearly one-third of the pediatric cases (32%) in the United States occurred in children age 15 to 17 years. Children are also at risk of a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The risk of vertical transmission is low (2%) in newborns of mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the gold standard for (SARS-CoV-2). Serology should be considered in a child with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when NAAT is negative and at least 2 weeks have passed since symptom onset and for assessment of MIS-C. Easy fatigability after COVID-19 infection is reported in adults; however, data in children are lacking. Implementation of early and robust containment strategies coupled with universal COVID-19 vaccination are vital to halt the spread. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(2):e84-e89.].

0	Characteristics and Outcomes Among Hospitalized COVID-19-Positive Patients in a Nonurban Environment. INTRODUCTION: Virtually all hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcome data come from urban environments. The extent to which these findings are generalizable to other settings is unknown. Coronavirus disease-2019 data from large, urban settings may be particularly difficult to apply in military medicine, where practice environments are often semi-urban, rural, or austere. The purpose of this study is compare presenting characteristics and outcomes of U.S. patients with COVID-19 in a nonurban setting to similar patients in an urban setting., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Hershey Medical Center (HMC), a 548-bed tertiary academic medical center in central Pennsylvania serving semi-urban and rural populations, from March 23, 2020, to April 20, 2020 (the first month of COVID-19 admissions at HMC). Patients and outcomes of this cohort were compared to published data on a cohort of similar patients from the New York City (NYC) area., RESULTS: The cohorts had similar age, gender, comorbidities, need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and most vital sign and laboratory studies. The NYC's cohort had shorter hospital stays (4.1 versus 7.2 days, P < .001) but more African American patients (23% versus 12%, P = .02) and higher prevalence of abnormal alanine (>60U/L; 39.0% versus 5.9%, P < .001) and aspartate (>40U/L; 58.4% versus 42.4%, P = .012) aminotransferase, oxygen saturation <90% (20.4% versus 7.2%, P = .004), and mortality (21% versus 1.4%, P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalists in nonurban environments would be prudent to use caution when considering the generalizability of results from dissimilar regions. Further investigation is needed to explore the possibility of reproducible causative systemic elements that may help improve COVID-19-related outcomes. Broader reports of these relationships across many settings will offer military medical planners greater ability to consider outcomes most relevant to their unique settings when considering COVID-19 planning.

0	Estimating the burden of COVID-19 on the Australian healthcare workers and health system during the first six months of the pandemic. INTRODUCTION: There are no publicly available national data on healthcare worker infections in Australia. It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia HCW and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHOD(S): We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian HCW infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. A line list of HCW related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for HCW were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to HCW cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst HCW, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULT(S): We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or HCW infection reports between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 HCW in Australia had been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of HCW infection was 90/100000 and of community infection 34/100,000. HCW were 2.69 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.48 to 2.93; P<0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 HCW across 21 outbreaks led to 1656 HCW being furloughed for quarantine. In one outbreak, one hospital was closed and 1200 HCW quarantined. CONCLUSION(S): The study shows that HCW were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, HCW are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous HCW during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faced a resurgence of COVID-19 after the study period, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of HCW infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for HCW.Copyright © 2020.

0	Guillain-Barre Syndrome in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report and Review of Management Strategies. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in an immune mediated disease that affects peripheral nerves with possible life-threatening complications. GBS has multiple subtypes including acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), which can make GBS difficult to diagnose. GBS commonly presents after viral infections such as influenza virus, campylobacter jejuni, and zika virus. GBS commonly presents with a prolonged clinical course leading to increased morbidity among affected patients. It is not surprising that COVID-19 has been connected with multiple cases of GBS, which may alter the recovery course for several patients post-COVID. In this report, we present a case of 69-year-old-female who presented with progressive motor weakness and loss of sensation in her extremities after testing positive for antibodies to COVID-19 one-month prior to presentation. Her presentation and treatment of GBS in the setting of COVID-19 is an example of one of the many COVID-19 complications and sheds light on the prolonged recovery course that we may experience as clinicians in the wake of this pandemic.	false
0	Estimating the infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during the spring 2020 pandemic wave: a model-based analysis. Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. Method(s): In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and >=75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). Finding(s): During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1.39% (95% credible interval 1.04-1.77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and >=75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0.116% (0.0729-0.148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0.939% (0.729-1.19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4.87% (3.37-6.89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14.2% (10.2-18.1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6.72% (5.52-8.01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19.1% (14.7-21.9) for those aged 75 years and older. Interpretation(s): Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

0	Dengue fever and COVID-19 Co-infection at the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Introduction: Co-infection with COVID-19 and other viral or bacterial infections has been described in many studies. Most cases of dengue fever in Saudi Arabia have been reported in Jeddah city and mainly during the summer season. Method and results: We describe four patients who presented to the emergency department with febrile illness accompanied by symptoms and blood tests suggestive of dengue fever. They also had radiological findings suggestive of COVID-19 chest infection and positive PCR tests. Three of the patients required hospital admission, and all had a good outcome. Conclusion(s): In areas with a high rate of dengue fever, serological screening for dengue fever should be considered as part of COVID-19 investigation, especially if symptoms or a full blood count are suggestive.Copyright European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine - © EFIM 2020	false
0	Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background The association of pulmonary embolism (PE) with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE is unknown. Purpose To conduct meta-analysis of the study-level incidence of PE and DVT and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE from multicenter individual patient data. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I2 = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I2 = 0.94), respectively. PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography. DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE. D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 mug/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT. The cutoffs of D-dimer levels used to exclude PE in preexisting guidelines seem applicable to patients with COVID-19. © RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

0	Symptoms related to mental disorder in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. BACKGROUND: Studies of previous pandemics indicate that healthcare workers have a high risk of developing symptoms related to mental health, especially depression, anxiety, and stress., OBJECTIVE: To identify mental disorder symptoms among Brazilian healthcare workers during the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic and compare findings in different work categories., METHODS: This was an online cross-sectional study. Information related to the pandemic and mental disorder symptoms was collected. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-revised were used. Associations were estimated by the chi-square test. The mean scores were compared among work categories with ANOVA (alpha = 5%) and the prevalence of symptoms was estimated., RESULTS: 1,609 healthcare workers participated in the survey [mean age: 36.9 (SD = 11.6) years, women = 83.6%]. There was no association between work category and changes in mental health during the pandemic (p = 0.288) or prevalence of unsafe feeling (p = 0.218). A significant relationship was observed between maintaining work activities during the pandemic and work category (p < 0.001). Physicians had the lowest out-of-work prevalence (9.5%) while dentists had the highest (32.3%). Physicians and nurses showed the highest prevalence of in-person work routine. Psychologists presented the highest prevalence of remote work (64.0%) while dentists had the lowest (20.2%). A high prevalence of depression (D), anxiety (A), and stress (S) symptoms was observed in all professional categories (D: 57.2, 95% CI 48.3-66.1%; A: 46.20%, 95% CI = 37.2-55.2%; S: 55.80%, 95% CI = 46.8-64.8%), with physicians (D = 38.4%, A = 25.80%, S = 37.90%), psychologists (D = 50.2%, A = 39.0%, S = 43.1%), and nurses (D = 50.0%, A = 40.9%, S = 49.0%) having significantly lower scores. Psychologists had the lowest pandemic-related psychological impact (42.70%, 95% CI 36.8-48.6%)., CONCLUSION: Extreme changes in the work routine of dentists and psychologists and an overall high prevalence of mental symptoms due to the pandemic were found. Researchers should focus on gathering information that can identify workers at increased risk of mental illness to guide discussions and develop actions to minimize the harm of the pandemic. In addition, we suggest that healthcare and support systems urgently adopt mental health care measures with specialized professionals to protect the psychological well-being of the healthcare community.	false
0	An Ophthalmic Insight into Novel Coronavirus 2019 Disease: A Comprehensive Review of the Ocular Manifestations and Clinical Hazards. Purpose: To discuss the ocular manifestations provoked by novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease in humans, the natural history of the disease in the eye, and its treatment., Methods: We designed a narrative review of the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 based on the literature published till July 30, 2020. The databases were PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The inclusion criteria were (1) all types of clinical studies and (2) the topic was COVID-19 and its association to the eye regarding the current guidelines., Results: From 168 abstracts screened, 61 papers fully filled the inclusion criteria after the full-text screening. The 61 records include 13 case reports, 17 prospective (case series or cross-sectional) studies, 8 retrospective studies, 12 literature reviews (one systematic review), and 11 letters to the editor. The majority of the papers agreed that ophthalmic manifestations due to COVID-19 were few and rarely encountered. The main ocular pathology seemed to be conjunctivitis, where the viral polymerase chain reaction also happened to be most detectable. Posterior segment or neuro-ophthalmic manifestations were scarce. Viral genome detection in the eye as well as viral portal of entry to the globe is still vague., Conclusion: The exact incidence of ocular manifestations in COVID-19 disease is uncertain. Conjunctivitis is the most prevalent ocular manifestation. It is still a debate whether the eye is a portal of entry for infection. Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Current Ophthalmology.	false
0	The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Stroke Epidemiology and Care: A Meta-Analysis. Objective: Emerging data indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and highlight the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the management and outcomes of acute stroke. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the aforementioned considerations. Method(s): We performed a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We used a random-effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): We identified 18 cohort studies including 67,845 patients. Among patients with SARS-CoV-2, 1.3% (95% CI = 0.9-1.6%, I2 = 87%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8-1.3%, I2 = 85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95% CI = 0.1-0.3%, I2 = 64%) for hemorrhagic stroke. Compared to noninfected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.43-8.92, I2 = 43%) and cryptogenic stroke (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.62-9.77, I2 = 0%). Diabetes mellitus was found to be more prevalent among SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients compared to noninfected historical controls (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.00-1.94, I2 = 0%). SARS-CoV-2 infection status was not associated with the likelihood of receiving intravenous thrombolysis (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.65-3.10, I2 = 0%) or endovascular thrombectomy (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.35-1.74, I2 = 0%) among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Odds of in-hospital mortality were higher among SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients compared to noninfected contemporary or historical stroke patients (OR = 5.60, 95% CI = 3.19-9.80, I2 = 45%). Interpretation(s): SARS-CoV-2 appears to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and potentially cryptogenic stroke in particular. It may also be related to an increased mortality risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:380-388.Copyright © 2020 American Neurological Association	false
0	COVID-19 Related Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Complications in Critically Ill Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Objective: This systematic-review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and complications in ICU-admitted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Data sources: PubMed and Web of Science databases were referenced until November 25, 2020. Data extraction: We extracted retrospective and prospective observational studies on critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Only studies reporting on cardiovascular comorbidities and complications during ICU therapy were included. Data synthesis: We calculated the pooled prevalence by a random-effects model and determined heterogeneity by Higgins' I2 test. Result(s): Of the 6346 studies retrieved, 29 were included in this review. The most common cardiovascular comorbidity was arterial hypertension (50%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-058; I2 = 94.8%, low quality of evidence). Among cardiovascular complications in the ICU, shock (of any course) was most common, being present in 39% of the patients (95% CI, 0.20-0.59; I2 = 95.6%; 6 studies). Seventy-four percent of patients in the ICU required vasopressors to maintain target blood pressure (95% CI, 0.58-0.88; I2 = 93.6%; 8 studies), and 30% of patients developed cardiac injury in the ICU (95% CI, 0.19-0.42; I2 = 91%; 14 studies). Severe heterogeneity existed among the studies. Conclusion(s): Cardiovascular complications are common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19. However, the existing evidence is highly heterogeneous in terms of study design and outcome measurements. Thus, prospective, observational studies are needed to determine the impact of cardiovascular complications on patient outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	Fear and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis during COVID-19 pandemic; report of an Iranian population. BACKGROUND: There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations., RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (+/-10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false

0	Patriarchy at the helm of gender-based violence during COVID-19. Gender-based violence (GBV) or violence against women and girls (VAWG), is a global pandemic that affects 1 in 3 women in their lifetime and VAWG is one of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world. The high level of investment going into the COVID-19 recovery plan is a unique opportunity to reshape our patriarchal society, to coordinate across sectors and institutions and to take measures to reduce gender inequalities. Relief efforts to combat the pandemic should take the needs of the vulnerable population, particularly women and girls afflicted by GBV into consideration, as their needs were mostly ignored in the recovery plan of Ebola. GBV is linked to dominance, power and abuse of authority or because any calamity, be it a pandemic, conflict or a disaster. This will further exacerbate pre-existing gendered structural inequalities and power hierarchies as protective mechanisms fail leaves women and girls more vulnerable, fueling impunity for the perpetrators. There is a need for international and domestic violence prevention policies to not only focus on narrowly defined economic or political 'empowerment' because that is insufficient when it comes to challenging existing gender inequalities. Incorporating an individual's religious beliefs and community of faith (mosque, church, temple or synagogue) can offer a support system for an individual and her/his family amid a public health crisis. There is a need to engage men and boys by tailoring messages to challenge gender stereotypes and unequal gender roles to overcome patriarchy.

0	High body mass index is a significant risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has spread worldwide. The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity. Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI >= 24and < 24. Result(s): A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI >= 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI >= 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI >= 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI >= 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI. Conclusion(s): Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI < 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI >= 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course. Thus, high BMI is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false

There were no confirmed severe or critically ill cases among the patients. Conclusion COVID-19 runs in a benign course in Egyptian children with no mortality and no significant morbidity.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 in Association With Development, Course, and Treatment of Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases. Autoimmune diseases and infections are often closely intertwined. Patients with autoimmune diseases are more susceptible to infections due to either active autoimmune disease or the medications used to treat them. Based on infections as environmental triggers of autoimmunity, an autoimmune response would also be expected in COVID-19. Although some studies have shown the occurance of autoantibodies and the possible development of autoimmune diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection, current data suggest that the levels of autoantibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is comparable to that of some other known infections and that the autoantibodies might only be transient. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) appears slightly higher compared to the general population and the course of COVID-19 disease does not seem to be very different, however, specific therapies such as glucocorticoids and anti-TNF might modulate the risk of hospitalization/death. Cytokine release syndrome is a severe complication in COVID-19. Many drugs used for the treatment of SARD are directly or indirectly targeting cytokines involved in the cytokine release syndrome, therefore it has been suggested that they could also be effective in COVID-19, but more evidence on the use of these medications for the treatment of COVID-19 is currently being collected.

0	COVID-19 VACCINE-ASSOCIATED ANAPHYLAXIS: A STATEMENT OF THE WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION ANAPHYLAXIS COMMITTEE. Vaccines against COVID-19 (and its emerging variants) are an essential global intervention to control the current pandemic situation. Vaccines often cause adverse events; however, the vast majority of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are a consequence of the vaccine stimulating a protective immune response, and not allergic in etiology. Anaphylaxis as an AEFI is uncommon, occurring at a rate of less than 1 per million doses for most vaccines. However, within the first days of initiating mass vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, there were reports of anaphylaxis from the UK and USA. More recent data implies an incidence of anaphylaxis closer to 1:125,000 doses with respect to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In this position paper, we discuss the background to reactions to the current COVID-19 vaccines and relevant steps to mitigate against the risk of anaphylaxis as an AEFI. We propose a global surveillance strategy led by allergists in order to understand the potential risk and generate data to inform evidence-based guidance, and thus provide reassurance to public health bodies and members of the public.

0	Safety and Efficacy of Low-Dose Corticosteroids in Patients With Non-severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Background To date, several pharmacological agents have been employed in the treatment and management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the utility of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 infection is now widely touted, their efficacy in thwarting the progression of non-severe disease remains elusive. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 25 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of non-severe COVID-19 infection was conducted. Subjects were assigned to either the steroid or the non-steroid group. A low-dose, short-course corticosteroid regimen was administered for seven days and the disease outcomes were recorded and compared among the two groups. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to discern the data normality. Results In patients treated with low-dose, short-course steroids, the overall all-cause mortality was significantly lower compared with the non-steroid group (8.3% and 61.5%, respectively; p = 0.005). The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the steroid group was significantly lower than that in the non-steroid group at the seven-day mark (16.7% and 84.6%, respectively; p = 0.002). Within the steroid group, the incidence of developing secondary complications was also markedly lower than that in the non-steroid group. Conclusions In patients afflicted with non-severe COVID-19, the employment of low-dose, short-course corticosteroids may confer a therapeutic advantage, significantly curtailing the mortality rate, the length of hospital stay, and the risk of developing secondary complications.

0	Restrictive Lung Disease in Patients With Subclinical Coronavirus Infection: Are We Bracing Ourselves for Devastating Sequelae?. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. The manifestations of COVID-19 infection can range from being asymptomatic to developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we present a case series of five patients who were either asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms of COVID-19 infection upon diagnosis. These patients neither required a visit to the emergency department (ED) nor did they need to be hospitalized but became symptomatic and were found to have interstitial lung disease four to eight weeks after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Thus, it is imperative that we routinely follow up patients with a subclinical COVID 19 infection besides those who were symptomatic. We may be witnessing a silent surge and new-onset interstitial lung disease (ILD) as sequelae of COVID 19 infection. Copyright © 2021, Dadhwal et al.	false
0	"The ""Golden Hours"" Algorithm For the Management of the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The global concern of increasing number of children presenting with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has escalated the need for a case-oriented clinical approach that provides timely diagnosis and management. The aim of this study is to share our experience in managing 64 MIS-C patients of North African ethnicity guided by a risk-based algorithm. Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria, 19 (30%) patients were categorized as mild and moderate risk groups and cared for in an isolation ward and 45 patients who belonged to the high-risk group (70%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Positive laboratory evidence of COVID-19 was found in 62 patients. Fever and dysfunction in 2 or more organs were confirmed in all cases (100%). Fifty patients (78%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, meanwhile only 10 patients (16%) had respiratory manifestations. Cardiac involvement was reported in 55 (86%) cases; hypotension and shock were found in 45 patients (70%) therein circulatory support and mechanical ventilations were needed for 45 and 13 patients respectively. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were used for all cases and methylprednisolone was used in 60 patients (94%). Fifty-eight (91%) patients were discharged home after an average of 9 days of hospitalization. The mortality rate was 9% (6 patients). Conclusion. A single Egyptian center experience in the management of MIS-C patients guided by a proposed bed side algorithm is described. The algorithm proved to be a helpful tool for first-line responders, and helped initiate early treatment with IVIG.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021."	false

0	Age-adjusted outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disorders. Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic with high worldwide mortality. It affects mainly the respiratory system and the few who have severe symptoms end up requiring ventilators. Very few studies on epidemiological characteristics have been published, showing the prevalence of comorbidities including cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD) but outcomes of such patients with pre-existing CeVD are unknown. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of CeVD and age-adjusted outcomes (mortality and needs of mechanical ventilation) of COVID-19 patients among pre-existing CeVD. Method(s): We conducted systematic review, searching PubMed for original full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 using ((COVID-19[Title/Abstract]) OR coronavirus[ Title/Abstract]) OR SARS-CoV-2[Title/Abstract] OR 2019-nCoV[Title/Abstract] and following MOOSE protocol. Literature other than observational studies, non-English literature, non-full text, and animal studies were excluded. Abstracts were reviewed, and articles were retrieved only if they mention CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities. We used comprehensive meta-analysis software to get the pooled prevalence of CeVD and the outcomes (mortality and needs of mechanical ventilator) and heterogeneity (I2) in the meta-analysis. Random effects model meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the unadjusted and age-adjusted correlations (r) and determination of correlation (R-squared) between CeVD and outcomes. We used age >50-years for the age-adjusted analysis (>50-years vs. <=50- years). p<0.05 was considered as significant. Result(s): We found 7-studies mention details on CeVD out of 23-studies described epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. 5 out of 7 studies have mentioned details on outcomes (mortality and needs for mechanical ventilator). Pooled prevalence of CeVD comorbidity was 5.03% [95%CI:3.3%- 7.6%; I2:51.7%; p<0.0001; 53/1087 patients]. Amongst those five studies, pooled prevalence of mortality was 17.2% [95% CI:7.6%-34.6%; I2:93.76%; p<0.0001; 147/792 patients] and needs of mechanical ventilator was 24.5% [95% CI:11.5%-44.6%; I2:93.94%; p<0.005; 158/608 patients]. On unadjusted regression analysis, mortality [r:0.62; Rsquared: 0.38; I2:93.76%; p<0.0001] and needs for ventilators [r:0.56; R-squared:0.31; I2:93.94%; p<0.0001] were significantly associated with pre-existing CeVD. On age-adjusted analysis, older patients >50-years had stronger association between mortality and CeVD [r:0.66; R-squared:0.43; I2:93.76%; p<0.0001] and needs of mechanical ventilator and CeVD [r:0.71; R-squared:0.51; I2:93.94%; p<0.0001] in compare to patients younger than 50-years. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD have poor outcomes and more observational studies should be performed to validate these findings as well as to evaluate the role of COVID-19 in developing new CeVD and stroke due to its pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states.	false
0	Prevalence of liver injury and correlation with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: Systematic review with meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Liver involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in several papers, but without homogeneous findings. We aimed to systematically review the prevalence of liver involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at their hospital admission, and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with or without pre-existing chronic liver disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, PMC, clinical trial registries, and other Coronavirus family publications for studies reporting data on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and liver function tests (LFTs) alterations, as well as clinical course of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Case reports, preprints, editorials, reviews were excluded. We also revised literature to describe the background of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULT(S): 36 studies, including 20724 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included. The pooled prevalence of LFTs abnormalities at admission was 46.9% (AST 26.5%, ALT 22.8%, GGT 22.5%, ALP 5.7%, tBIL 8.0%). ALT, AST, tBIL were independent predictors of disease severity (ALT OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.03; AST OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.10- 4.77; tBIL OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.18-4.58) and in-hospital mortality (ALT OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96; AST OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.68-7.18; tBIL OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.28- 26.40). Heterogeneity among studies was high. The few available data also reported that COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSION(S): LFTs alterations were reported in up to 47% of unselected patients with COVID-19 and were associated with severe disease or in-hospital mortality. In cirrhotic patients, COVID-19 was associated with high risk of liver decompensation or mortality.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 27 million confirmed cases and 8,90,000 deaths all around the world. Verity of viral infections can infect the nervous system; these viral infections can present a wide range of manifestation. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms. For that we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of four online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. All relevant articles that reported psychiatric/psychological symptoms or disorders in COVID-19 without considering time and language restrictions were assessed. All the study procedures were performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Due to the screening, 14 studies were included. The current study result indicated that, the pooled prevalence of CNS or mental associated disorders with 95% CI was 50.68% (6.68-93.88). The most prevalence symptoms were hyposmia/anosmia/olfactory dysfunction (number of study: 10) with 36.20% (14.99-60.51). Only one study reported numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia. Pooled prevalence of numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia was 5.83% (2.17-12.25) and 2.39% (10.75-14.22). The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 3.52% (2.62-4.54) and 13.92% (9.44-19.08). Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has a certain relation with neurological symptoms. The hypsomia, anosmia or olfactory dysfunction was most frequent symptom. Other symptoms were headache or dizziness, dysgeusia or ageusia, dysphonia and fatigue. Depression, anxiety, and confusion were less frequent symptoms.

0	Potent neutralization of clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 D614 and G614 variants by a monomeric, sub-nanomolar affinity nanobody. Despite unprecedented global efforts to rapidly develop SARS-CoV-2 treatments, in order to reduce the burden placed on health systems, the situation remains critical. Effective diagnosis, treatment, and prophylactic measures are urgently required to meet global demand: recombinant antibodies fulfill these requirements and have marked clinical potential. Here, we describe the fast-tracked development of an alpaca Nanobody specific for the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with potential therapeutic applicability. We present a rapid method for nanobody isolation that includes an optimized immunization regimen coupled with VHH library E. coli surface display, which allows single-step selection of Nanobodies using a simple density gradient centrifugation of the bacterial library. The selected single and monomeric Nanobody, W25, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with sub-nanomolar affinity and efficiently competes with ACE-2 receptor binding. Furthermore, W25 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 wild type and the D614G variant with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, demonstrating its potential as antiviral agent.	false
0	Production of hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 intravenous immunoglobulin from pooled COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Background: This study assesses the feasibility of producing hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 intravenously administrable immunoglobulin (C-IVIG) from pooled convalescent plasma (PCP) to provide a safe and effective passive immunization treatment option for COVID-19. Materials & methods: PCP was fractionated by modified caprylic acid precipitation followed by ultrafiltration/diafiltration to produce hyperimmune C-IVIG. Results: In C-IVIG, the mean SARS-CoV-2 antibody level was found to be threefold (104 +/- 30 cut-off index) that of the PCP (36 +/- 8.5 cut-off index) and mean protein concentration was found to be 46 +/- 3.7 g/l, comprised of 89.5% immunoglobulins. Conclusion:  The current method of producing C-IVIG is feasible as it uses locally available PCP and simpler technology and yields a high titer of SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The safety and efficacy of C-IVIG will be evaluated in a registered clinical trial (NCT04521309).	false
0	Effect of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells on lung damage in severe COVID-19 patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Treatment of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging. We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage, based on our phase 1 data. In this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage. They were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either UC-MSCs (4 x 107 cells per infusion) or placebo on day 0, 3, and 6. The primary endpoint was an altered proportion of whole lung lesion volumes from baseline to day 28. Other imaging outcomes, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and adverse events were recorded and analyzed. In all, 100 COVID-19 patients were finally received either UC-MSCs (n = 65) or placebo (n = 35). UC-MSCs administration exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (the median difference was -13.31%, 95% CI -29.14%, 2.13%, P = 0.080). UC-MSCs significantly reduced the proportions of solid component lesion volume compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%; 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%; P = 0.043). The 6-MWT showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00 m; 95% CI 0.00, 57.00; P = 0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that UC-MSCs treatment is a safe and potentially effective therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with lung damage. A phase 3 trial is required to evaluate effects on reducing mortality and preventing long-term pulmonary disability. (Funded by The National Key R&D Program of China and others.

0	Rapid seroconversion and persistent functional IgG antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients correlates with an IL-12p70 and IL-33 signature. Despite ongoing efforts to characterize the host response toward SARS-CoV-2, a major gap in our knowledge still exists regarding the magnitude and duration of the humoral response. Analysis of the antibody response in mild versus moderate/severe patients, using our new developed quantitative electrochemiluminescent assay for detecting IgM/IgA/IgG antibodies toward SARS-CoV-2 antigens, revealed a rapid onset of IgG/IgA antibodies, specifically in moderate/severe patients. IgM antibodies against the viral receptor binding domain, but not against nucleocapsid protein, were detected at early stages of the disease. Furthermore, we observed a marked reduction in IgM/IgA antibodies over-time. Adapting our assay for ACE2 binding-competition, demonstrated that the presence of potentially neutralizing antibodies is corelated with IgG/IgA. Finally, analysis of the cytokine profile in COVID-19 patients revealed unique correlation of an IL-12p70/IL33 and IgG seroconversion, which correlated with disease severity. In summary, our comprehensive analysis has major implications on the understanding and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections.	false
0	Anemia predicts poor outcomes of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients: a prospective study in Iran. BACKGROUND: There are limited number of studies with controversial findings regarding the association between anemia at admission and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Therefore, in this research, we aimed to investigate the prospective association between anemia and COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in Iran., METHODS: In this prospective study, the data of 1274 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 were statistically analyzed. All biomarkers, including hemoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were measured using standard methods. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 13 g/dL and 12 g/dL in males and females, respectively. Assessing the association between anemia and COVID-19 survival in hospitalized patients was our primary endpoint., RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 64.43 +/- 17.16 years, out of whom 615 (48.27%) were anemic subjects. Patients with anemia were significantly older (P = 0.02) and had a higher frequency of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer (P < 0.05). The frequency of death (anemic: 23.9% vs. nonanemic: 13.8%), ICU admission (anemic: 27.8% vs. nonanemic:14.71%), and ventilator requirement (anemic: 35.93% vs. nonanemic: 20.63%) were significantly higher in anemic patients than in nonanemic patients (P < 0.001). According to the results of regression analysis, after adjusting for significant covariate in the univariable model, anemia was independently associated with mortality (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.57, P = 0.01), ventilator requirement (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.54, P = 0.004), and the risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.90, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was high and was associated with poor outcomes of COVID-19.	false
0	The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children. One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.	false
0	Tissue Distribution of ACE2 Protein in Syrian Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and Its Possible Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Related Studies. The Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has recently been demonstrated as a clinically relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers these models' optimal use. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. Using two different antibodies (MA5-32307 and AF933), we have conducted immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis to evaluate the ACE2 expression in different tissues of the hamster. Further, at the mRNA level, the expression of Ace2 in tissues was evaluated through RT-qPCR analysis. Both the antibodies detected expression of ACE2 in kidney, small intestine, tongue, and liver. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine were negative for ACE2 expression. Analysis of tissues from different age groups and sex didn't show any obvious difference in ACE2 expression pattern or level. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression patterns in human tissues and contradict others. We believe that this study's findings have provided evidence that demands further investigation to understand the predominant respiratory pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

0	Biological security of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in large workplaces outside the healthcare sector - an epidemiologist's point of view. Populations in large workplaces are particularly susceptible to the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In the following article, an attempt has been made to identify main problems regarding the biological security in large workplaces outside the healthcare sector, while simultaneously pointing out the possible solutions to these problems. In this article, a literature review was performed with regard to publications that have been published within the last 4 months, concerning the issue of risk factors with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations. Experts' opinions and statements released by institutions working in this field were also taken into consideration. On the basis of the available publications, key procedures to protect workers in large workplaces against COVID-19 were established. One of these key factors is infection prevention. It is commonly known that, due to limited possibilities of identifying infected people that are asymptomatic, physical distance in the whole employee population should be kept; personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used and tele-work should be implemented. The results of recent research have shown that, apart from airborne ways of transmission, there also exists a possibility of getting infected by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. Therefore, frequent disinfection of rooms and work tools is essential. In the current situation, due to the lack of a vaccine, only going through the COVID-19 disease, either in a symptomatic or asymptomatic form, significantly increases the chances of developing natural immunity. The means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections include quickly identifying the infected people on the basis of the symptoms they report, keeping physical distance, using PPE, disinfecting rooms and applying proper ventilation. Limiting the number of workers by implementing a remote work pattern is also recommended. Med Pr. 2021;72(1):89-97.

0	Artificial intelligence and radiology: Combating the COVID-19 conundrum. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid testing and diagnosis to manage its spread. While reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is being used as the gold standard method to diagnose COVID-19, many scientists and doctors have pointed out some challenges related to the variability, accuracy, and affordability of this technique. At the same time, radiological methods, which were being used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic in China, were sidelined by many primarily due to their low specificity and the difficulty in conducting a differential diagnosis. However, the utility of radiological methods cannot be neglected. Indeed, over the past few months, healthcare consultants and radiologists in India have been using or advising the use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest for early diagnosis and tracking of COVID-19, particularly in preoperative and asymptomatic patients. At the same time, scientists have been trying to improve upon the radiological method of COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring by using artificial intelligence (AI)-based interpretation models. This review is an effort to compile and compare such efforts. To this end, the latest scientific literature on the use of radiology and AI-assisted radiology for the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 has been reviewed and presented, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such techniques.Copyright © 2021 Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging.	false
0	Social predictors of food insecurity during the stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Results from a cross-sectional web-based survey. Background Stay-at-home orders and social distancing have been implemented as the primary tool to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this approach has indirectly caused, only in Lima- Peru, more than 2.3 million Peruvians to lose their jobs. As a result, the risk of food insecurity may have increased in affected low-income families, especially those that depend on daily income. This study estimates the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity (MSFI) and identifies the associated factors that explain this outcome during the stay-at-home order. Methods A cross-sectional web-based survey, with the non-probability sample, was conducted between May 18 and June 30, 2020, during the stay-at-home order in Peru. We used social media advertisements on Facebook to reach 18-59 year-olds living in Peru. MSFI was assessed using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Rasch model methodology requirements were considered, and factors associated with MSFI were selected using a stepwise forward selection. A Poisson generalized linear model (Poisson GLMs), with log link function, was employed to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR). Findings This analysis is based on 1846 replies. The prevalence of MSFI was 23.2%, and FIES proved to be an acceptable instrument with reliability 0.72 and infit 0.8-1.3. People more likely to experience MSFI were those with low income (less than 255 US$/month) in the pre-pandemic period (aPR 3.77; 95%CI, 1.98-7.16), those whose income was significantly reduced during the pandemic period (aPR 2.27; 95%CI, 1.55-3.31), and those whose savings ran out in less than 21 days (aPR 1.86; 95%CI, 1.43-2.42). Likewise, heads of households (aPR 1.20; 95%CI, 1.00-1.44) and those with relatives with probable SARS-CoV2 cases (aPR 1.29; 95%CI, 1.05-1.58) were at an increased risk of MSFI. Additionally, those who perceived losing weight during the pandemic (aPR 1.21; 95%CI, 1.01-1.45), and reported increases in processed foods prices (aPR 1.31; 95%CI, 1.08-1.59), and eating less minimally processed food (aPR 1.82; 95%CI, 1.48-2.24) were also more likely to experience MSFI. Interpretation People most at risk of MSFI were those in a critical economic situation before and during the pandemic period. It is necessary to reinforce social protection policies to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. Funding None.	false
0	Tracking COVID-19 using online search. Previous research has demonstrated that various properties of infectious diseases can be inferred from online search behaviour. In this work we use time series of online search query frequencies to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised modelling techniques based on associated symptom categories identified by the United Kingdom's National Health Service and Public Health England. We then attempt to minimise an expected bias in these signals caused by public interest-as opposed to infections-using the proportion of news media coverage devoted to COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models based on online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2-23.2) and 22.1 (17.4-26.9) days, respectively. We also investigate transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the spread of the disease has progressed extensively to countries that are in earlier phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting querying patterns, including the finding that rarer symptoms are better predictors than common ones. Finally, we show that web searches improve the short-term forecasting accuracy of autoregressive models for COVID-19 deaths. Our work provides evidence that online search data can be used to develop complementary public health surveillance methods to help inform the COVID-19 response in conjunction with more established approaches.	false
0	Intentions to Seek Mental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Chinese Pregnant Women With Probable Depression or Anxiety: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey Study. BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are prevalent among pregnant women, and it is expected that their mental health will worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the underutilization of mental health services among pregnant women has been widely documented., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that are associated with pregnant women's intentions to seek mental health services. We specifically assessed pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems in mainland China., METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from February to March, 2020 among 19,515 pregnant women who were recruited from maternal health care centers across various regions of China. A subsample of 6248 pregnant women with probable depression (ie, those with a score of >=10 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) or anxiety (ie, those with a score of >=5 on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale) was included in our analysis., RESULTS: More than half (3292/6248, 52.7%) of the participants reported that they did not need mental health services. Furthermore, 28.3% (1770/6248) of participants felt that they needed mental health services, but had no intentions of seeking help, and only 19% (1186/6248) felt that they needed mental health services and had intentions of seek help. The results from our multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, education level, and gestational age were factors of not seeking help. However, COVID-19-related lockdowns in participants' cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were protective factors of participants' intentions to seek help from mental health services., CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that promote seeking help for mental health problems among pregnant women should also promote social support from health care providers and trust between pregnant women and their care providers.

0	COVID-19 in cancer patients: a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Development of severe disease and death from COVID-19 is more frequent in patients with comorbidities. Some studies report an increased frequency of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients. This review aims to describe the risk of infection and developing severe COVID-19 in cancer patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was carried out through an exhaustive search of literature in PubMed and Scopus until May 2020. A secondary search was performed to include more studies., RESULTS: The initial search identified 2,192 records, which included 17 publications with at least 10 infected cancer patients. Also, 5 articles were added from the additional search of the references cited by those 17 publications. Ten publications were from Chinese authors. Data analysis showed that COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients, and frequent therapeutic visits to the healthcare facility may be the cause. The presence of neoplasia predisposed patients to develop severe disease. Advanced age, associated comorbidities, advanced malignancy, and the presence of serum inflammatory markers increased the risk of developing severe disease. Initial studies indicate that the use of systemic treatment may also be a predisposing factor., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of becoming infected by COVID-19 and developing severe disease is higher in the oncological population.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 genome and antibodies in breastmilk: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyse the rate of SARS-CoV-2 genome identification and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breastmilk of mothers with COVID-19., DESIGN: A systematic review of studies published between January 2019 and October 2020 without study design or language restrictions., SETTING: Data sourced from Ovid Embase Classic+Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, relevant bibliographies and the John Hopkins University COVID-19 database., PATIENTS: Mothers with confirmed COVID-19 and breastmilk tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome and antibodies in breastmilk., RESULTS: We included 50 articles. Twelve out of 183 women from 48 studies were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genome in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 5% (95% CI 2% to 15%; I2=48%)). Six infants (50%) of these 12 mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one requiring respiratory support. Sixty-one out of 89 women from 10 studies had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 83% (95% CI 32% to 98%; I2=88%)). The predominant antibody detected was IgA., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 genome presence in breastmilk is uncommon and is associated with mild symptoms in infants. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be a more common finding. Considering the low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 genome detected in breastmilk and its lower virulence, mothers with COVID-19 should be supported to breastfeed.

0	COVID-19 and the eye: a review. BACKGROUND: To provide a review for general practitioners and medical specialists about the most common eye complaints and ocular manifestations in a COVID-19 patient., METHODS: Reviewed 50 articles referenced in 4 databases from 20 December 2019 to 16 September 2020., RESULTS: Of the 50 articles reviewed, 26 met the criteria for analysis and were included in the study. Among them were 5 reviews, 6 case series, 7 case reports, 4 cross-sectional studies, 2 systematic reviews, 1 cohort study and 1 correspondence. We found that the prevalence of ocular manifestations in patients during the course of COVID-19 varied between 0.8% and 31.6%, depending on the study design. Symptoms of acute conjunctivitis were the most frequent clinical findings. Acute phase reactants were also correlated to ocular manifestations and the severity of the systemic disease in many reports., CONCLUSIONS: Ocular manifestations are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients and have been associated with higher levels of acute phase reactants as well as a higher degree of severity of the systemic disease. We recommend that all physicians consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis in the presence of acute conjunctivitis with or without systemic symptoms.	false
0	Serological cross-reaction and coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 in Asia: Experience from Indonesia. Similar symptoms and laboratory findings between dengue and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose a diagnostic challenge in some dengue-endemic countries in Asia. In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue coinfection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results for dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 coinfection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using the NS1 antigen serology test. This case was the first case of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection in Indonesia and revealed possible cross-reactivity between SARS-COV-2 and DENV antibodies based on rapid serological tests. Our study indicates a public health concern regarding COVID-19 and dengue detection in Indonesia as well as in other dengue-endemic countries, and it is important for these nations to manage both pathogens concurrently.

0	Rare SARS-CoV-2 antibody development in cancer patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and immunity will be crucial for the further course of the pandemic. Until now, it has been assumed that patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop antibodies as has been the case with other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19. Understanding the adaptive and humoral response to SARS-CoV2 will play a key role in vaccine development and gaining further knowledge on the pathogenesis. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Point-of-care test system for detection of immunoglobulin-G and -M against nucleocapsid protein and spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to ravage the world. In epidemic control, dealing with a large number of samples is a huge challenge. In this study, a point-of-care test (POCT) system was successfully developed and applied for rapid and accurate detection of immunoglobulin-G and -M against nucleocapsid protein (anti-N IgG/IgM) and receptor-binding domain in spike glycoprotein (anti-S-RBD IgG/IgM) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Any one of the IgG/IgM found in a sample was identified as positive. The POCT system contains colloidal gold-based lateral flow immunoassay test strips, homemade portable reader, and certified reference materials, which detected anti-N and anti-S-RBD IgG/IgM objectively in serum within 15 min. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity. It exhibited equal to or better performances than four approved commercial kits. Results of the system and chemiluminescence immunoassay kit detecting 108 suspicious samples had high consistency with kappa coefficient at 0.804 (P < 0.001). Besides, the levels and alterations of the IgG/IgM in an inpatient were primarily investigated by the POCT system. Those results suggested the POCT system possess the potential to contribute to rapid and accurate serological diagnosis and epidemiological survey of COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Tracking the dynamics and spread of COVID-19 is critical to mounting an effective response to the pandemic. In the absence of randomized representative serological surveys, many SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies have relied on convenience sampling to estimate cumulative incidence. One common approach is to recruit at frequently visited community locations (""venue-based"" sampling), but the sources of bias and uncertainty associated with this strategy are still poorly understood. Here, we used data from a venue-based community serosurveillance study, GPS-estimated foot traffic data, and data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to report an estimate of cumulative incidence in Somerville, Massachusetts, and a methodological strategy to quantify and reduce uncertainty in serology-based cumulative incidence estimates obtained via convenience sampling. The mismatch between the geographic distribution of participants' home locations (the ""participant catchment distribution"") and the geographic distribution of infections is an important determinant of uncertainty in venue-based and other convenience sampling strategies. We found that uncertainty in cumulative incidence estimates can vary by a factor of two depending how well the participant catchment distribution matches the known or expected geographic distribution of prior infections. GPS-estimated business foot traffic data provides an important proxy measure for the participant catchment area and can be used to select venue locations that minimize uncertainty in cumulative incidence."	false
0	[Threat of a SARS-CoV-2 endemic in a large hospital specialized in rheumatic diseases-relative all clear through consistent testing]. The severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is keeping most countries of the world in suspense. In Germany the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is under 2% but for weeks the numbers in Germany have also been increasing. The care in rheumatology was temporarily impaired by the first wave of the pandemic. This article reports the infection situation in the largest specialized rheumatology clinic in Germany, the Rheumatism Center Ruhrgebiet, because recently during the second wave for the first time several SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred here over one weekend, which led to considerable anxiety in many of those involved. The situation could be clarified by consistent testing of patients and personnel with the rapid antigen test and the situation could be mollified. Ultimately, only a few persons were tested positive and the courses by the patients have so far remained bland. This shows the effectiveness of the protective hygiene measures consistently implemented since April.	false
0	Prone ventilation in positive patients for sars-COV2. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar.1 Prevalence of ARDS among COVID-19 patients has been reported to be up to 17%.2 Among the introduced treatment methods for management of ARDS patients, prone position can be used as an adjuvant therapy for improving ventilation in these patients.3. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to describe our experience with prone position in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. We also compared the patients who survived with those who died to understand if there were any 28-day mortality predictors. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 admitted in Hospital Beatriz Angelo (HBA) ICU from April to June of 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, severity scoring scales, PaO2/FiO2, days on mechanical ventilation, number and hours of prone position, complications, days at Intensive Care Unit and deaths were extracted from medical records and were submitted to statistic description and analysis. Result(s): There were 62 patients positive for SARS-CoV2 admitted in HBA ICU from April to June of 2020, and 39 were mechanically ventilated. Twenty patients (32%) were placed in prone position, 65% were males. The mean age was 63 years old (minimum 31 and maximum 83). In relation to the severity criteria, the medium APACHE II score was 13 points and SAPS II was 37 points. Half of the patients (10) registered a severe ARDS (P/F <= 100) when admitted in the ICU and had had symptoms for 8 days before IOT. In six patients there was a HNFC trial, without success. These 20 patients fulfilled on average 5 periods of prone ventilation and the mean of prone ventilation hours were 94. The patients were ventilated for 32 hours on average before prone position. The first prone position lasted a mean of 20 hours. These patients were intubated on average 15 days. Fifty percent were extubated for NIV and in 5 patients was performed a tracheostomy. There were complications like accidental extubation (2), exteriorization of a central venous catheter (1), facial edema (1) and pressure ulcers (5). These patients have been in the ICU for 20 days on average, with a 20 percent mortality rate in the ICU plus 5% in the hospital < 28 days. When we compare the patients that survived with those who died, the latter were older (60 years vs 71), had worse SAPS II (34 vs 46) and APACHE II (12 vs 16), more days of symptoms until intubated (7 vs 12) and hours of ventilation until prone position (25 vs 53). On the other hand, we found that patients that survived had an inferior initial p/f ratio (118 vs 170). Conclusion(s): Even before SARS-CoV2 pandemic we knew ARDS is an inflammatory process, with long hospitalization and significant mortality. From our experience, this study seems to show that the sooner the patients are intubated and placed in prone position, the best the outcome. Further research is needed.	false
0	Unexpected Decrease in Shunt Surgeries Performed during the Shelter-in-Place Period of the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: It is expected that the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt malfunctions would remain unchanged during the shelter-in-place period related to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): To examine the number of shunt surgeries performed in a single institution during this time interval in comparison to equivalent periods in past years. METHOD(S): The numbers of elective and emergent/urgent shunt surgeries performed at a single institution were queried for a 28-d period starting on the third Monday of March, between years 2015 and 2020. These were further stratified by how they presented as well as the type of surgery performed. RESULT(S): During the 28-d period of interest, in the years between 2015 and 2020, there was a steady increase in the number of shunt surgeries performed, with a maximum of 64 shunt surgeries performed in 2019. Of these, approximately 50% presented in urgent fashion in any given year. In the 4-wk period starting March 16, 2020, a total of 32 shunt surgeries were performed, with 15 of those cases presenting from the outpatient setting in emergent/urgent fashion. For the surgeries performed, there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of revision shunt surgeries performed. CONCLUSION(S): During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unexpected decrease in the number of shunt surgeries performed, and particularly in the number of revision surgeries performed. This suggests that an environmental factor related to the pandemic is altering the presentation rate of shunt malfunctions.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021.	false
0	Reciprocating-flowing on-a-chip enables ultra-fast immunobinding for multiplexed rapid ELISA detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The worldwide epidemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a strong demand for highly efficient immunobinding to achieve rapid and accurate on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s. This strategy was further developed into an immunoassay method for the serological detection of 13 suspected COVID-19 patients. We obtained a 100% true negative and true positive rate and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.14 pg/mL. Our strategy also can be a potential support for other areas related to immunorecognition, such as proteomics, immunopharmacology and immunohistochemistry.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Mortality risk of COVID-19 in elderly males with comorbidities: a multi-country study. The COVID-19 pandemic causes severe morbidity and mortality. This multi-country study aimed to explore risk factors that drive mortality in COVID-19 patients who received neither dexamethasone nor remdesivir. We analyzed a cohort of 568 survivors and 507 non-survivors from China, European regions, and North America. Elderly males >=70 years accounted for only 25% of survivors, but this rate was significantly higher in non-survivors from China (55%), European regions (63%), and North America (47%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had more incidences of comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, p-values<0.05). Survival analyses revealed age, male gender, shortness of breath, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD as mortality-associated factors. Survival time from symptom onset was significantly shorter in elderly versus young patients (median: 29 versus 62 days), males versus females (median: 46 versus 59 days), and patients with versus without comorbidities (mean: 41 versus 61 days). Mortality risk was higher in elderly males with comorbidities than in young females without comorbidities (p-value<0.01). Elderly male survivors with comorbidities also had longer hospital stays than other survivors (25 versus 18.5 days, p-value<0.01). Overall, the high mortality risk in elderly males with COVID-19-associated comorbidities supports early prevention and critical care for elderly populations.	false
0	Adjusting Coronavirus Prevalence Estimates for Laboratory Test Kit Error. Testing representative populations to determine the prevalence or the percentage of the population with active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and/or antibodies to infection is being recommended as essential for making public policy decisions to ease restrictions or to continue enforcing national, state, and local government rules to shelter in place. However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100%-in some cases, considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence is low, possibly in the range of 1%-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that most likely will be larger, and possibly much larger, than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. Methods are outlined in this article for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. If used, these methods also would help harmonize study results within countries and worldwide. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions. However, adjustment will not improve the accuracy of an individual test.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

0	COVID-2019 Associated with Acquired Monocular Blindness. Objective: We documented an older female with Coronavirus(CoV) Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and concomitant acquired monocular blindness. We examined this phenomenon in order to understand COVID-19 better. Methods: We observed an older female with COVID-19 and concomitant acquired monocular blindness. The following indicators were monitored during the course of the disease: ocular examinations, flash visual evoked potential examination, a blood test for COVID-19 IgM antibodies, as well as nasopharyngeal swab and tear sample tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid. Results: The patient's visual acuity for the left eye was NLP and the intraocular pressure was 51 mmHg. Keratic precipitates similar to mutton-fat were spread over the corneal endothelium of the left eye. The funduscopic examination of the patient's left eye revealed severe retinal arterial ischemia, and the color of the retina was off-white. Compared to the right eye, the flash visual evoked potential examination revealed a moderate decrease in P2 wave amplitude for the left eye. A blood test was positive for COVID-19 IgM antibodies, and a nasopharyngeal swab test taken for COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive on May 4, 2020. A sample of the patient's tears was taken, and the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was still positive two weeks later. Conclusions: Our study was the first to find that acute viral retinitis could occur in patients with COVID-19 and severe blindness could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, physicians should consider the possibility of coronavirus infection in patients with an abnormal fundus or suddenly vision loss.	false
0	Structural analysis of viral ExoN domains reveals polyphyletic hijacking events. Nidoviruses and arenaviruses are the only known RNA viruses encoding a 3’-5’ exonuclease domain (ExoN). The proofreading activity of the ExoN domain has played a key role in the growth of nidoviral genomes, while in arenaviruses this domain partakes in the suppression of the host innate immune signaling. Sequence and structural homology analyses suggest that these proteins have been hijacked from cellular hosts many times. Analysis of the available nidoviral ExoN sequences reveals a high conservation level comparable to that of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which are the most conserved viral proteins. Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified. This is in sharp contrast with the reported lack of zinc fingers in cellular ExoNs, and opens the possibility of therapeutic strategies in the struggle against COVID-19	false
0	Mn2+ coordinates Cap-0-RNA to align substrates for efficient 2′-O-methyl transfer by SARS-CoV-2 nsp16. Capping viral messenger RNAs is essential for efficient translation and prevents their detection by host innate immune responses. For SARS-CoV-2, RNA capping includes 2′-O-methylation of the first ribonucleotide by methyltransferase nsp16 in complex with activator nsp10. The reaction requires substrates, a short RNA and SAM, and is catalyzed by divalent cations, with preference for Mn 2+ . Crystal structures of nsp16-nsp10 with capped RNAs revealed a critical role of metal ions in stabilizing interactions between ribonucleotides and nsp16, resulting in precise alignment of the substrates for methyl transfer. An aspartate residue that is highly conserved among coronaviruses alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove. This aspartate is absent in mammalian methyltransferases and is a promising site for designing coronavirus-specific inhibitors.	false
0	The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Students' Health and Financial Stability in New York City: Findings from a Population-Based Sample of City University of New York (CUNY) Students. Understanding the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on students' health and financial stability is important to establish effective interventions to mitigate these effects, which may have long-term consequences on their health and well-being. Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the USA. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19. Students who become infected need mental health services as well as health monitoring.	false
0	Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in China. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 5 million people around the world and killed more than 300,000 people; thus, it has become a global public health emergency. Our objective was to investigate the mental health of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19., METHODS: The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Trauma Exposure Scale, abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Demographic Questionnaire were used to examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, trauma exposure, resilience and perceived social support among 898 patients who were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. The data were analyzed with t tests, one-way ANOVA and multivariable logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety was 13.2, 21.0 and 16.4%, respectively. Hospitalized patients who were more impacted by negative news reports, had greater exposure to traumatic experiences, and had lower levels of perceived social support reported higher PTSD, depression and anxiety., CONCLUSIONS: Effective professional mental health services should be designed to support the psychological wellbeing of hospitalized patients, especially those who have severe disease, are strongly affected by negative news and have high levels of exposure to trauma.	false

We present the first reported cases of delayed inflammatory reactions (DIR) to hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers after exposure to the COVID-19 spike protein. DIR to HA is reported to occur in the different scenarios including: secondary to poor injection technique, following dental cleaning procedures, following bacterial/viral illness, and after vaccination. In this report of 4 cases with distinct clinical histories and presentations: one case occured following a community acquired COVID-19 infection, one case occured in a study subject in the mRNA-1273 clinical phase III trial, one case occurred following the first dose of publically available mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna, Cambridge MA), and the last case occurred after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer, New York, NY). Injectable HA dermal fillers are prevalent in aesthetic medicine for facial rejuvenation. Structural modifications in the crosslinking of HA fillers have enhanced the products' resistance to enzymatic breakdown and thus increased injected product longevity, however, have also led to a rise in DIR. Previous, DIR to HA dermal fillers can present clinically as edema with symptomatic and inflammatory erythematous papules and nodules. The mechanism of action for the delayed reaction to HA fillers is unknown and is likely to be multifactorial in nature. A potential mechanism of DIR to HA fillers in COVID-19 related cases is binding and blockade of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptors (ACE2), which are targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein to gain entry into the cell. Spike protein interaction with dermal ACE2 receptors favors a pro-inflammatory, loco-regional TH1 cascade, promoting a CD8+T cell mediated reaction to incipient granulomas, which previously formed around residual HA particles. Management to suppress the inflammatory response in the native COVID-19 case required high-dose corticosteroids (CS) to suppress inflammatory pathways, with concurrent ACE2 upregulation, along with high-dose intralesional hyaluronidase to dissolve the inciting HA filler. With regards to the two vaccine related cases; in the mRNA-1273 case, a low dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) was utilized for treatment, to reduce pro-inflammatory Angiotensin II. Whereas, in the BNT162b2 case the filler reaction was suppressed with oral corticosteroids. Regarding final disposition of the cases; the vaccine-related cases returned to baseline appearance within 3 days, whereas the native COVID-19 case continued to have migratory, evanescent, periorbital edema for weeks which ultimately subsided."	false
0	"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a great impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) that includes negative mental health outcomes, such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, we report on mental health outcomes among HCWs in Cyprus. Data were collected between 3 May and 27 May 2020, with the use of an online questionnaire that included demographics (sex, age, occupation, education, work sector, years of work experience), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) which assesses depressive symptoms, the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R), which measures post-traumatic stress disor-der (PTSD) symptoms, and the-10 item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) which quantifies stress re-sponses. Participants (42% physicians, 24% nurses, 18% physiotherapists, 16% classified as ""other"") were 58% of female gender and aged 21-76. A total of 79 (18.6%) and 62 HCWs (14.6%) reported clinically significant depressive (PHQ-9 >= 10) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R > 33) symptoms re-spectively. Nurses were more likely than physicians to suffer from depression (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.7 (1.06-2.73); p = 0.035) and PTSD (adjusted prevalence ratio 2.51 (1.49-4.23); p = 0.001). Even in a country with a rather low spread of the COVID-19, such as Cyprus, HCWs reported a substan-tial mental health burden, with nurses reporting increased depressive and PTSD symptoms compared to other HCWs.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

0	Social influence of COVID-19: An observational study on the social impact of post-COVID-19 lockdown on everyday life in Kerala from a community perspective. BACKGROUND: The current novel coronavirus pandemic started as a simple outbreak in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, and it has now become a global threat. The governments from most of the countries including India have already taken strict precautionary measures to reduce the coronavirus spread such as social distancing, closure of schools, colleges, airports, restaurants, shopping malls, and other places where the people might gather. An increase in the levels of anxiety, aggression, depression, forgetfulness, and hallucinations are possible psychological effects of isolation. Too little is understood of the social impact of the pandemic., AIM: To study the social impact of post-COVID-19 lockdown in Kerala from a community perspective., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted among 700 families (50 families from each district) from all the 14 districts of Kerala from during April-May 2020 using respondent-driven sampling. The data were analyzed and the categorical variables have been presented as percentages and proportions., RESULTS: Anxiety (44%) and fear (44.3%) were reported by many of the study participants. The survey also picked up an increase in the prevalence of domestic violence (13.7%) during the period. The most common social change brought about by the lockdown was an improvement in the hygiene practices among the study population., CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the positive social changes brought about as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies need to be conducted on a larger scale to assess the psycho-behavioural impact of COVID-19 on the wider population. Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.	false
0	COVID-19 and emergencies in patients with diabetes: two case reports. BACKGROUND: Maldives reported its first Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on March 7th, 2020. Since then more than 9400 positive cases and 33 deaths have been reported. Recently studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a poor prognosis and a higher mortality rate when compared to the non-diabetic patients. Poorly controlled diabetic patients had a higher incidence of complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) which might have been precipitated by COVID-19. DKA and HHS are potentially lethal but preventable conditions. During this pandemic, although cases of uncontrolled diabetes are frequently reported, there is scarcity in reporting of cases with diabetic emergencies., CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 53-year old Asian male, admitted on Day 10th of illness with DKA with acute kidney injury, and Moderate COVID-19. Case 2 was a 72-year old Asian male, admitted with mild COVID-19 who developed HHS with acute kidney injury on day 9 of illness. Both patients were managed conservatively in intensive care unit, with intravenous fluids and insulin., CONCLUSION: Clinicians should focus on close monitoring of diabetic patients with COVID-19, to prevent diabetic emergencies like DKA and HHS. It is important to aggressively manage these conditions for a favorable outcome.	false
0	Severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a 30-year-old woman in the 36th week of pregnancy treated with postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patient: Female, 30-year-old Final Diagnosis: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia Symptoms: Dyspena Medication: - Clinical Procedure: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Specialty: Critical Care Medicine * Infectious Diseases Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusion(s): Unusual clinical course There are few reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women. Although coagulation dys-function was reported to affect the severity of COVID-19, the association between pregnancy, which is usually accompanied by changes in coagulation function, and the worsening of COVID-19 is unknown. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman in the 36th week of pregnancy who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and required postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. A 30-year-old, 36-weeks pregnant woman presented to our hospital and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia soon after she had undergone a cesarean section. Her respiratory failure could not be managed by conventional therapeutic approaches. Therefore, ECMO was administered on day 7. Controlling coagulation function to maintain ECMO therapy was challenging. Nafamostat mesylate and cryoprecipitate were administered to treat the hypercoagulative status and severe hypofibrinogenemia, respectively. Since coagulopathy and her respiratory state improved, the ECMO therapy was terminated on day 15. We report a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant woman urgently treated with ECMO in the postpartum period. Thus, this case highlights the importance of close monitoring and appropriate medical care for pregnant women with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © Am J Case Rep,.	false
0	Diabetic ketoacidosis at type 1 diabetes onset: Indirect impact of covid-19 pandemic. Summary. Reorganization of healthcare resources due to COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unintentional neglect of essential care, especially for paediatric emergencies. This phenomenon has been observed also for type 1 diabetes patients at onset, and surveys from different countries have shown an increased number of diabetic ketoacidosis during lock-down period. We report the case of two patients admitted late at our emergency care service for type-1 diabetes at onset with ketoacidosis, for reasons related to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Case report 1: A 5 years old boy, presented with a severe diabetic ketoacidosis, requiring admission in Intensive Care Unit, prolonged intravenous insulin infusion and enteral nutrion via nasogastric tube. Case report 2: A 10 years old girl presented in the emergency department with a history respiratory distress, due to Kussmaul's breathing, and severe dehydration. Laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of moderate diabetic ketoacidosis. We have further analyzed the experience of our Centre regarding new onset type 1 diabetes patients during lock-down period: we observed a reduction of admissions for type 1 diabetes onset during lock-down period compared to same period of 2019, with a higher prevalence of moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis. We conclude highlighting the upcoming necessity, due to the emerging of a 'second wave' of the pandemic, that public opinion and healthcare practitioners provide correct information regarding access to paediatric services, in particular for children with newly onset symptoms, in order to avoid late access to emergency department in critical situations and to prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality.

0	Acute pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patient: a case report of free-floating right heart thrombus successfully treated with fibrinolysis. Background: Despite the fast-growing understanding of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patient management remains largely empirical or based on retrospective studies. In this complex scenario, an important clinical issue appears to be represented by the high prevalence of thromboembolic events, but the data regarding high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is still not available., Case summary: A patient with COVID-19 developed sudden shortness of breath and hypoxia. Early echocardiographic diagnosis of high-risk PE related to right heart thrombus was performed. Systemic thrombolysis was administered with excellent clinical and haemodynamic response., Discussion: Pulmonary thromboembolism is a common occurrence in severe COVID-19 infection. In our experience, systemic thrombolysis proved to be effective and for this reason may be considered for life-threatening PE in COVID-19 patients. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Prediction of SARS-CoV Interaction with Host Proteins during Lung Aging Reveals a Potential Role for TRIB3 in COVID-19. COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease. Copyright copyright: © 2021 Moraes et al.	false
0	Return to sports after COVID-19 infection. The cardiovascular effects and long-term consequences of COVID-19 are currently unclear. The question of eligibility for sport and the point of return to sport following both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with or without suspected involvement of the myocardium is currently becoming more and more important in leisure as well as in competitive sports. Fortunately, from previous studies and registries of acute myocarditis, it has been known that athletes with a complete recovery have a very good prognosis. Nevertheless, to optimize counselling and treatment of athletes in the future, prospective data collection on the current corona pandemic is urgently needed. To this end, the non-evidence-based recommendations for a return to sports presented herein might serve as a first guideline.Copyright © 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Predictive value of the prognostic nutritional index for the severity of coronavirus disease 2019. Objectives: Malnutrition plays a critical role in the onset and progress of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19. Method(s): Clinical data were collected from 122 patients infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, China, a specialized infectious hospital affiliated with the Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI score was calculated as serum albumin (g/L) + 5 x total lymphocyte count (/nL). Result(s): The study population consisted of 105 patients (86.1%) with a common form and 17 patients (13.9%) with a severe form of COVID-19. PNI score significantly decreased from patients with common to severe forms of COVID-19 (P =. 029) regardless of sex, age range, and body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P =. 030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P =. 402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"Decline and Recurrence of Stroke Consultations during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Parallels Population Activity Levels. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (CPL) lead to a significant decrease in emergency admissions worldwide. We performed a timely analysis of ischemic stroke (IS) and related consultations using the telestroke TEMPiS ""working diagnosis"" database prior (PL), within (WL), and after easing (EL) of CPL., METHODS: Twelve hospitals were selected and data analyzed regarding IS (including intravenous thrombolysis [intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen; IV rtPA] and endovascular thrombectomy [EVT]) and related events from February 1 to June 15 during 2017-2020. In addition, we aimed to correlate events to various mobile phone mobility data., RESULTS: Following the significant reduction of IS, IV rtPA, and EVT cases during WL compared to PL in 2020 longitudinally (p values <0.048), we observed increasing numbers of consultations, IS, recommendations for EVT, and IV rtPA with the network in EL over WL not reaching PL levels yet. Absolute numbers of all consultations paralleled best to mobility data of public transportation over walking and driving mobility., CONCLUSIONS: While the decrease in emergency admissions including stroke during CPL can only be in part attributed by patients not seeking medical attention, stroke awareness in the pandemic, and direct COVID-19 triggered stroke remains of high importance. The number of consultations in TEMPiS during the lockdown parallels best with mobility of public transportation. As a consequence, exposure to common viruses, well-known triggers for acute cerebrovascular events and other diseases, are reduced and may add to the decline in stroke consultations. Further studies comparing national responses toward the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and stroke incidences are needed. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel."	false

0	Descriptive study of urine cultures in patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 during the months of March-May 2020. Introduction: Bacterial superinfections have been a very frequent finding in patients admitted to theICU diagnosed with COVID-19, some of them associated with devices, highlighting thecatheter associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI). Objective(s): Our objective with this abstract is to analyze the results of urine cultures in patientsdiagnosed with COVID-19 admitted in UCI. Method(s): Descriptive, observational, and retrospective study of urine cultures that werewithdrawn in patients admitted with COVID-19, between March and May 2020 in theUCI of a third-level hospital. We analyze : demographic data, number of urine cultureswithdrawn, number of positive urine cultures, percentage of gram positive, gramnegative and fungi and incidence density of CA-UTI. Result(s): We included 60 patients, 48 (80%) were men and 12 women (20%), median APACHEII score 14.1 points, median age 60.47 years. In 40 patients (68.9%) a urine culturewas withdrawn, with a total number of urine cultures of 77 samples. The number ofpatients with a positive results were 18 (31%), and the number of positives urineculture were 22 (28.5%); negative results were 55 (71.4%). Regarding themicrobiological isolates, in 5 urine cultures (22.7%) gram positives were isolated, beingall of them E. faecalis. In 4 positive urine cultures (18.1%), gram negatives wereisolated, being all of them E. coli, 2 of wich were ESBL. Also striking is the highpercentage of fungal isolates, in a total of 13 urine cultures (59%). 11 of them were C.albicans, and the remaining 2 were C. glabrata.Of the 22 urine cultures with positive results, 14 of them were considered colonizationsor contaminants, while 8 of them were considered bacterial superinfections. The totalnumber of urinary catheterization days were 1118, with a total of 7.16 urinary infectionsfor every 1000 days of urinary catheterization. Conclusion(s): Our study shows a high percentage of urine cultures with negative results. Amongpositive results, the majority of isolates have been considered colonization orcontamination, and not superinfection. These data can be explained by the presence ofdifferent confounding factors in these patients, since they are complex patients withhigh severity and extensive use of devicesAlthough most cultures are negative or contaminated, the urinary infection rate isabove the results obtained in other series of patients not admitted for COVID-19 in ourunit. This reminds us that although we work in different conditions than usual and witha new disease, we must not forget the prevention measures of CA-UTI Zero project.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing: The tower of babel. Summary. Background and aim: Testing represents one of the main pillars of public health response to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. Method(s): We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. Result(s): Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. Conclusion(s): Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential. We advocate the use of pooled strategies when planning population-wide screening, and the weekly use of rapid tests for close periodic monitoring in low-prevalence populations.

0	Potential False-Positive and False-Negative Results for COVID-19 IgG/IgM Antibody Testing After Heat-Inactivation. Objectives: With the worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), various antibody detection kits have been developed to test for SARS-CoV-2- specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody. However, the use of different testing methods under various heat-inactivation conditions might affect the COVID-19 detection results. Methods: Seven different antibody detection kits produced by four manufacturers for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and total antibody were tested at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China. Most of the kits used the indirect immunity, capture, and double-antigen sandwich methods. The effects of various heat-inactivation conditions on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody detection were analyzed for the different test methods. Results: Using the indirect immunity method, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody significantly increased and those for IgM antibody decreased with increasing temperature of heat-inactivation using indirect immunity method. However, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and total antibody showed no change when the capture and double-antigen sandwich methods were used. The changes in IgG and IgM antibody values with the indirect immunity method indicated that heat-inactivation could affect COVID-19 detection results obtained using this method. In particular, 18 (22.2%) SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive samples were detected as negative with heat-inactivation at 65degreeC for 30 min, and one (25%) IgG negative sample was detected as positive after heat-inactivation at 56degreeC for 60 min and 60degreeC for 30 min. Conclusions: Heat-inactivation could increase SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody values, and decrease IgM antibody values, causing potential false-positive or false-negative results for COVID-19 antibody detection using the indirect immunity method. Thus, before conducting antibody testing, the testing platforms should be evaluated in accordance with the relevant requirements to ensure accurate COVID-19 detection results.

0	Diagnostic Accuracy of Electro-Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serological Test. Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of fully automated electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological test for detection of past SARS-CoV-2 infection and to be used in seroprevalence surveys. Method: A total of 426 patients who had tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 from August 1 to 31, 2020 were selected for the study. Informed consent was obtained and a questionnaire including the patient's age, gender, symptoms, and past polymerase chain reaction (PCR) status was filled by the patient. Samples were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on Roche Cobas e601. Results: The mean age of the patients was 42.43 +/- 16.67 years. One hundred and five (24.6%) were PCR positive, while 321 (75.4%) were PCR negative. Most patients were males 241 (56.6%) while 185(43.3%) were females. Over 185(43.3%) patients presented with symptoms, and the rest of the patients 241 (56.6%) were asymptomatic. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 had sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 99.06%, positive predictive value (PPV) 96.90%, negative predictive value (NPV) 96.6%, and positive likelihood ratio 4.26, while negative likelihood ratio 0.1. Diagnostic accuracy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 96.7% based on receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Conclusion: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is very useful for the detection of past COVID-19 infection; it can be proved helpful in the identification of post-COVID complications and actual disease burden in a population.	false

0	A flexible, pan-species, multi-antigen platform for the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the vaccination effort that is ongoing has created an unmet need for accessible, affordable, flexible and precise platforms for monitoring the induction, specificity and maintenance of virus-specific immune responses. Herein we validate a multiplex (Luminex-based) assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies irrespective of host species, antibody isotype, and specimen type (e.g. plasma, serum, saliva or blood spots). The well-established precision of Luminex-based assays provides the ability to follow changes in antibody levels over time to many antigens, including multiple permutations of the most common SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This platform can easily measure antibodies known to correlate with neutralization activity as well as multiple non-SARS-CoV-2 antigens such as vaccines ( e . g . Tetanus toxoid) or those from frequently encountered agents (influenza), which serve as stable reference points for quantifying the changing SARS-specific responses. All of the antigens utilized in our study can be made in-house, many in E. coli using readily available plasmids. Commercially sourced antigens may also be incorporated and newly available antigen variants can be rapidly produced and integrated, making the platform adaptable to the evolving viral strains in this pandemic. <h4>Brief Summary</h4> A multi-antigen assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies irrespective of host species, antibody isotype, and specimen type was developed.	false
0	962 Miami mother-baby COVID collaborative: a prospective study linking circulating factors, placental findings and pregnancy complications. Objective: A hallmark of SARS-CoV2 (SV) infection is systemic proinflammation. We hypothesize that in pregnancy, the maternal response to viral infection leads to a local proinflammatory, antiangiogenic, prothrombotic milieu at the maternal fetal interphase, contributing to placental lesions and leading to placenta mediated complications (PMC). Study Design: We developed and measured a customized array of cytokine, chemokine, anti-angiogenic, vascular, oxidative stress and apoptotic markers from patients enrolled in the Miami Mother Baby Covid Collaborative (MMBCC), a prospective perinatal sample collection study, offered to all women delivering at a large urban hospital in Miami, FL between 04/20/20 & 07/31/20. Maternal serum concentrations from randomly selected SV+ patients (Group [G] 1), healthy SV- (G2) & G1's umbilical cord plasma (G3) were analyzed by LuminexTM multiplex assay system. An expert perinatal pathologist graded placentas (Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group criteria). Result(s): Mean serum concentrations of proinflammatory markers were higher in G1 vs G2: IL-1(P=.02), IL-6 (P=.03), IL-8 (P=.001), IL-12 (P=.03), IL-17 (P=.01), IFNgamma (P=.01), IP-10 (P=.001), MIP-1alpha (P=.03), MIP-1beta (P=.001), but not TNFalpha (P=.10). See Table 1. Interestingly, all G1 patients with elevated serum IL-6 concentrations (cutoff 4.455 pg/ml, AUC 0.7955) exhibited placental fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM). FVM was identified in al G3 samples with an elevated MCP-1 (cutoff: 45.22 pg/ml, AUC: 0.6591). Maternal age, BMI, & ethnicity were similar, while delivery gestational age, birthweight & preeclampsia were borderline different between G1 & G2 (P=.08). See Table 2. Conclusion(s): For the first time, we report that elevated antepartum maternal concentrations of IL-6 predict FVM. FVM is also highly correlated with cord blood levels of MCP-1. Trends in cytokine/chemokine patterns in the setting of SV+ infection appear to be distinct in the maternal versus fetal circulation, and both are linked to specific placental defects, especially FVM, which has been linked to fetal growth restriction and fetal central nervous system injury.

INTRODUCTION: Given the possible coexistence of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 with other seasonal infections, the aim is to identify differential symptoms. I know has studied the role of children in intrafamily contagion and the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an area with low community transmission., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study. Patients between 0-15 years studied by RT-PCR technique due to clinical suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus in the months of March-May 2020. Survey on symptoms and contacts. Determination of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at least 21 days after the RT-PCR test., RESULTS: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and age mean 8.4 years (95% CI 6.8-10,5) higher than not infected. Fever was the most common and with greater sensitivity. The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P=0.029) and headache (P=.009) among children infected with a specificity of 96.7% and 81.5% respectively. There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms. 81.8% of those infected were probably infected in the nucleus 85.2% by a parent who worked outside the home. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70.9% and its negative predictive value 91.1%., CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the symptoms more specific difficult to detect in younger children. Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission. The sensitivity of RT-PCR could be related to a less contagiousness in children after one week of infection. Copyright © 2020.

Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals previously infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). We herein compared five new CE-IVD-labeled commercially available SARS-CoV-2 whole-blood finger-stick IgG/IgM combined RDTs, in parallel according to the manufacturers' instructions, with two serum panels obtained from 48 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (panel I) and from a group of 52 patients randomly selected, for whom serum samples collected before the COVID-19 epidemic (from October 1 to November 30, 2019) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (panel II). We found a sensitivity of 95.8 %, 91.6 %, 92.3 %, 97.9 % and 91.4 %, and a specificity of 98.1 %, 86.5 %, 100 %, 98.1 % and 84.6 %, for BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) (Biosynex Swiss SA, Freiburg, Switzerland), Humasis COVID-19 IgG/IgM Test (Humasis Co., Ltd., Gyneonggi, Republic of Korea), LYHER COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test (Medakit Ltd, Hong Kong, China), SIENNATM COVID-19 (IgG/IgM) Rapid Test Cassette (Salofa Oy, Salo, Finland) and NG-BIOTECH COVID-19 (IgG/IgM) (NG-Biotech, Guipry, France), respectively. Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined RDTs have a sufficient sensitivity for identifying individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, but some RDTs may lack of specificity, with risk of false positivity mainly for the IgM band.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Viral Clearance and Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Kidney Transplant Recipients. Objectives: Knowledge about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) concerning viral shedding and humoral immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is limited. The aim of this study is to analyze viral dynamics and the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs with COVID-19 and study their association with clinical data. Material(s) and Method(s): Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusion(s): In our series, KTRs with severe COVID-19 had prolonged viral shedding and a stronger humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. These preliminary data need to be confirmed with further studies and over a longer period of time.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Prevalence of diabetes, management and outcomes among Covid-19 adult patients admitted in a specialized tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This retrospective study aimed to characterize comorbidities and associated with mortality among hospitalized adults with Covid-19 managed as per the Saudi Ministry of Health protocol in a specialized tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Medical records of 300 adult patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection and admitted in King Salman Hospital (KSH) from May 1 to July 31, 2020 were included. Medical history, management and outcomes were noted. Males significantly outnumber females (259 versus 41). South Asians comprise 41% of all admitted patients. Mortality rate was 10% and highest among Saudi males (28.9%). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was the most common comorbidity (45.7%). Almost all patients (99%) had pneumonia. Patients > 50 years were three times more likely to die (confidence interval, CI 1.3-6.9; p = 0.01) from Covid-19. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio OR 19.4, CI-1.5-260.0; p = 0.02) and acute kidney injury (OR 11.7, CI-4.7-28.6; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher mortality. Dexamethasone use significantly improved the final outcome based on net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) (p < 0.05). In this single-center study, T2DM was very common among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Patients > 50 years, those with congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury are at higher risk for worse Covid-19 outcome.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Fecal occult blood and urinary cytology tests for rapid screening of inflammatory infection in the gastrointestinal and urological systems in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019. Background: Gastrointestinal infections (GI) and urological infections (UI) have not been fully addressed in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to evaluate the values of routine fecal occult blood (FOB) test and urinary cytology test (UCT) for screening of GI and UI in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): In this retrospective study, COVID-19 patients without associated comorbidities were divided into FOB- or UCT-positive or FOB- or UCT-negative groups. Their clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were then compared. Result(s): A total of 13.6% of patients (47 of 345) tested positive for FOB, and 57.4% (27 of 47) of these patients lacked gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 30.1% of patients (104 of 345) exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms, and 38.0% (131 of 345) were positive for either FOB or gastrointestinal symptoms. FOB-positive patients possessed significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and fewer lymphocytes than FOB-negative patients. A total of 36.9% of patients (80 of 217) exhibited positive UCT, and 97.5% (78 of 80) of these patients possessed normal levels of serum markers for renal injuries. Significant differences in age and sex ratios were observed between the UCT-positive and UCT-negative groups, and 72.4% (42 of 58) of female patients over 60 years old were UCT-positive. Conclusion(s): Fecal occult blood test in combination with gastrointestinal symptoms could serve as a simple and useful screening approach for GI diagnoses for COVID-19. Age and sex are risk factors for UI in COVID-19 patients. UCT could be a sensitive tool for assessing early UI at a stage in which serum markers for renal injuries appear normal.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Bacterial expression and purification of functional recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has applied significant pressure on overtaxed healthcare around the world, underscoring the urgent need for rapid diagnosis and treatment. We have developed a bacterial strategy for the expression and purification of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain using the CyDisCo system to create and maintain the correct disulfide bonds for protein integrity and functionality. We show that it is possible to quickly and inexpensively produce functional, active antigen in bacteria capable of recognizing and binding to the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptor as well as antibodies in COVID-19 patient sera.	false
0	"COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing For All - Using Non-Dilutive Saliva Sample Collection, Stabilization and Ambient Transport Devices. COVID-19 testing is not accessible for millions during this pandemic despite our best efforts. Without greatly expanded testing of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing and subsequent isolation of spreaders remains as a means for control. In an effort to increase RT-PCR assay testing for the presence of the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as well as improve sample collection safety, GenTegra LLC has introduced two products for saliva collection and viral RNA stabilization: GTR-STM TM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium) and GTR-STMdk TM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium Direct to PCR). Both products contain a proprietary formulation based on GenTegra's novel ""Active Chemical Protection TM"" (ACP) technology that gives non-dilutive, error-free saliva sample collection using RNA stabilization chemicals already dried in the collection tube. GTR-STM can be used for safer saliva-based sample collection at home (or at a test site). Following saliva collection, the sample-containing GTR-STM can be kept at ambient temperature during shipment to an authorized CLIA lab for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in GTR-STM is stable for over a month at ambient temperature, easily surviving the longest transit times from home to lab. GTR-STM enhances patient comfort, convenience, compliance and reduces infectious virus exposure to essential medical and lab professionals. Alternatively, the GTR-STMdk direct-into-PCR product can be used to improve lab throughput and reduce reagent costs for saliva sample collection and testing at any lab site with access to refrigeration. GTR-STMdk reduces lab process time by 25% and reagent costs by 30% compared to other approaches. Since GTR-STMdk retains SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability for three days at ambient temperature, it is optimized for lab test site rather than at home saliva collection. SARS-COV-2 viral RNA levels as low as 0.4 genome equivalents/uL are detected in saliva samples using GTR-STMdk. The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection can expand COVID-19 testing to include asymptomatic individuals using pooled saliva., One Sentence Summary: GTR-STM and Direct-into-PCR GTR-STMdk offer substantive improvements in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability, safety, and RT-PCR process efficiency for COVID-19 testing by using a non-dilutive saliva sample collection system for individuals at home or onsite respectively."	false
0	Performance of the COVID19SEROSpeed IgM/IgG rapid test, an immunochromatographic assay for the diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 infection: A multicenter European study. This study assessed the diagnostic performance of the new COVID19-SEROSpeed IgM/IgG rapid test (BioSpeedia, a spinoff of the Pasteur Institute of Paris) for the detection of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in comparison to other commercial antibody assays through a large cross-European investigation. The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 prepandemic sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders). The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests. The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients. The specificity of the test (BioS) on prepandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.2% to 99.4%). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), with good concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.62). Due in part to simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG for both S1 and N proteins, BioS exhibited the highest positive percent agreement at $11days post-symptom onset (PSO). In conclusion, the BioS IgM/IgG rapid test was highly specific and demonstrated a higher positive percentage of agreement than all the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/chemiluminescence immunoassay (ELISA/CLIA) commercial tests considered in this study. Moreover, by detecting the presence of antibodies prior to 11days PSO in 78.2% of the patients, the BioS test increased the efficiency of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2021 Plebani et al.

0	Patient and staff safety of bedside percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients in a medical ICU. Introduction: During COVID 19 pandemic, many considerations have been discussed about tracheostomy in ICU patients, in terms of efficacy, timing, and health care professionals safety. Tracheostomy is an aerosol generating procedure and therefore some recommendations have been proposed: skilled intervening staff, surgical technique, full personal protective equipment (PPE) use and negative pressure environment if possible. However in our medical ICU we were not able to apply some of these recommendations. Objective(s): To describe and analyse patient and staff safety of bedside percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients in a medical ICU Methods: We recorded data of consecutive patients diagnosed with ARDS secondary to COVID 19 who required extended mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy during their ICU stay. We registered demographic data, mechanical ventilation parameters, information about the procedure and we finally prospectively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 transmission to health care professionals. Result(s): We included 35 COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients; tracheostomy was performed in 11 patients (31%). Negative pressure environment was unavailable. Percutaneous technique with single dilator was applied at bedside in ICU. Previous ultrasound assessment was implemented and bronchoscopy was used as a standard of care during the procedure. The mean duration of the procedure was 38 minutes [35.1- 40.9]. Nine out of 11 tracheostomies (81.8%) were performed by critical care resident doctors (4th-5th year of training). Only 4 patients (36.36%) had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR at the moment of the procedure. PPE including fluid-resistant gown, ocular protection (goggles or face shield), gloves and FFP3 mask, was used in all cases. Median of mechanical ventilation days up to tracheostomy was 21 [20- 24]. Any technique complication was detected. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology (IgM/IgG) were negative in all staff participants after a proper window period. Conclusion(s): Despite not following all the expert opinion recommendations regarding tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, no safety events occurred to our patients and no SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare providers was detected.	false
0	Partnering with Local Hospitals and Public Health to Manage COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Almost half of deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States are linked to nursing homes (NHs). We describe among short-term and long-term residents at three NHs in Michigan the outbreak identification process, universal testing, point prevalence of COVID-19, and subsequent containment efforts, outcomes, and challenges. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds = 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHOD(S): Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials, and parent corporation implemented immediate facility-wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID-19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment reeducation and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID-19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14-day outcomes. RESULT(S): A total of 29 cases of COVID-19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were identified through symptom-triggered testing from March 23 to April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted from April 7 to 15, 2020. The hospitalization rate was 37.9%. The case fatality rate was 20.7% (6/29); these patients had multiple comorbidities. No residents who tested positive through the point-prevalence survey required hospitalization, and five were discharged home within 14 days. CONCLUSION(S): Proactive and coordinated steps between NH medical directors and administrators, referral hospitals including their laboratories, and local public health officials are necessary to rapidly respond to an outbreak and limit the transmission of COVID-19. This coordinated public health approach may save lives, minimize the burden to the healthcare system, and reduce healthcare costs.Copyright © 2020 The American Geriatrics Society	false
0	Ischemic necrosis of lower extremity in COVID-19: A case report. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. Elderly patients or those with underlying diseases are more seriously affected. We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a geriatric patient with arteriovenous thrombosis of the right lower limb. Despite persistent anticoagulant therapy, the patient's arterial thrombosis continued to progress and presented with ischemic necrosis of the lower extremity. After amputation in this case, the levels of D-dimer and inflammatory cytokine increased progressively, and he presented with acute myocardial infarction, which progressed rapidly to multisystem organ failure. However, whether coronavirus can directly cause the damage of the cardiovascular system and thrombosis needs further investigation.Copyright © 2021 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.	false
0	Intimate partner violence among prenatal care attendees amidst the COVID-19 crisis: The incidence in Ethiopia. Objective: To assess the incidence and predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted at the prenatal care clinic of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, among pregnant women from 31 August to 2 November 2020. Participants were interviewed using Open Data Kit. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors. Result(s): Among the 464 pregnant women, 33 (7.1%) reported IPV during pregnancy, and among these 24 (72.7%) reported emotional violence, 16 (48.5%) reported sexual violence, and 10 (30.3%) reported physical violence. Among the study participants, only 8 (1.7%) were screened for IPV. IPV was reported 3.27 times more often by women who reported that their partner chewed Khat compared with those women whose partner did not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-7.38), and 1.52 times more often women who reported that their partner drank alcohol compared with those women whose partner did not (aOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.28). Conclusion(s): Very few women were screened for IPV. Partners drinking alcohol and chewing Khat are significantly positively associated with IPV during pregnancy. IPV screening should be included in the national management protocol of obstetric cases of Ethiopia.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics	false
0	Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Humans: Relevance to Acquired Immunity and Vaccine Responses. The factors responsible for the spectrum of COVID-19 disease severity and the genesis and nature of protective immunity against COVID-19 remain elusive. Multiple studies have investigated the immune responses to COVID 19 in various populations, including those without evidence of COVID 19 infection. Information regarding innate and adaptive immune responses to the novel SARS-CoV-2 has evolved rapidly. Here, data are accumulating defining disease phenotypes that aid in rational and informed development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of novel vaccines. In this article, we summarize data on important innate immune responses including cytokines, specifically IL-6 and complement, and explore potential treatments. We also examine adaptive immune responses and derivative therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies directed at spike proteins. Finally, we explore data on real-time assessments of adaptive immune responses which include CD4+/CD8+ T-cells, NKT-cells, memory B-cells, and T-follicular cells with specificities for COVID-19 peptides in infected individuals and normals. Data of two novel vaccines have been released, both showing >95% efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of humoral and cellular responses to the vaccines will determine the robustness and durability of protection. In addition, long-term assessment of SARS-CoV-2 memory B and T-cell mediated immune responses in patients recovering from an infection or those with cross-reactive immunologic memory will help to define risk for future SARS-CoV infections. Finally, patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection may experience prolonged immune activation likely due to T-cell exhaustion. This will be an important new frontier for study.

0	Incidence of thrombotic complications and overall survival in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the second and first wave. INTRODUCTION: In the first wave, thrombotic complications were common in COVID-19 patients. It is unknown whether state-of-the-art treatment has resulted in less thrombotic complications in the second wave., METHODS: We assessed the incidence of thrombotic complications and overall mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to eight Dutch hospitals between September 1st and November 30th 2020. Follow-up ended at discharge, transfer to another hospital, when they died, or on November 30th 2020, whichever came first. Cumulative incidences were estimated, adjusted for competing risk of death. These were compared to those observed in 579 patients admitted in the first wave, between February 24th and April 26th 2020, by means of Cox regression techniques adjusted for age, sex and weight., RESULTS: In total 947 patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis, of whom 358 patients were admitted to the ICU; 144 patients died (15%). The adjusted cumulative incidence of all thrombotic complications after 10, 20 and 30 days was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-15%), 16% (13-19%) and 21% (17-25%), respectively. Patient characteristics between the first and second wave were comparable. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall mortality in the second wave versus the first wave was 0.53 (95%CI 0.41-0.70). The adjusted HR for any thrombotic complication in the second versus the first wave was 0.89 (95%CI 0.65-1.2)., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was reduced by 47% in the second wave, but the thrombotic complication rate remained high, and comparable to the first wave. Careful attention to provision of adequate thromboprophylaxis is invariably warranted. Copyright © 2021 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens. This POCT detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen in saliva and would be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases	false
0	Host PDZ-containing proteins targeted by SARS-Cov-2. Small linear motif targeting protein interacting domains called PDZ have been identified at the C-terminus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins E, 3a, and N. Using a high-throughput approach of affinity-profiling against the full human PDZome, we identified sixteen human PDZ binders of SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3A and N showing significant interactions with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 μM to 82 μM. Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Seven of the PDZ-containing proteins among binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a or N affect significantly viral replication under knock-down gene expression in infected cells. This PDZ profiling identifying human proteins potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 can help to understand the multifactorial severity of COVID19 and to conceive effective anti-coronaviral agents for therapeutic purposes.	false
0	Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by dimeric IgA. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might affect the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here, we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals after diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Furthermore, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be twofold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were, on average, 15 times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target. Thus, dimeric IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on emergency plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations. BACKGROUND: In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe social disruptions, including restrictions to the movement of people. Healthcare centres around the world have seen changes in the nature of injuries acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic; we therefore hypothesize that social isolation measures have changed the pattern of plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed comparing patient presentations during the enforced COVID-19 lockdown to two previous periods. All emergency referrals requiring operative intervention by the plastic and reconstructive surgery unit of our institution were included. Patient demographics, place and mechanism of injury, drug and alcohol involvement, delays to presentation, length of admission and complication rates were collected., RESULTS: Demographics and complication rates were similar across all groups. A 31.8% reduction in total number of emergency cases was seen during the lockdown period. Increase in do-it-yourself injuries (P = 0.001), bicycle injuries (P = 0.001) and injuries acquired via substance abuse (P = 0.041) was observed. Head and neck injuries, mostly due to animal bites and falls, were also more prevalent compared to the same period the previous year (P = 0.007). As expected, over 80% of plastic surgery operations during the COVID-19 period were due to injuries acquired at home, a significant increase compared to previous periods., CONCLUSION: Despite changes in the pattern of presentations requiring plastic and reconstructive emergency surgery, traumatic injuries continued to occur during the pandemic. Thus, planning will be essential to ensure resource allocation for emergency procedures is sustained as second and third waves of COVID-19 cases emerge worldwide.

0	Myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 is similar to pneumonias of other origin: results from a multicentre study. Aims: COVID-19, a respiratory viral disease causing severe pneumonia, also affects the heart and other organs. Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. Methods and Results: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6] was indifferent, d-dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID-19 = 23.7% vs. non-COVID-19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID-19 = 17.1% vs. non-COVID-19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. Conclusion(s): Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID-19. While mortality was also similar, COVID-19 is characterized with increased thrombogenicity and high pulmonary embolism rates.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Anti-coagulation for COVID-19 treatment: both anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been linked to a higher risk of mortality compared to influenza, which is mainly due to severe secondary diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In turn, ARDS is characterized by an acute inflammation and an excessive activity of the coagulation cascade, rising the vulnerability for venous thromboembolic events. In order to investigate the relation of inflammation and the influence of coagulation factors on their release, human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) were treated with autologous serum, heparinized plasma and different doses of fibrin. Thereafter, the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome of PBMCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our analyses revealed autologous serum to significantly increase the secretion of cytokines and chemokines after 24 h of incubation time. Furthermore, the addition of fibrin markedly increased the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, in accordance with previous studies, our study outlines that anti-coagulation may constitute a promising tool for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, reducing both, the cytokine storm, as well as the risk for thrombotic complications.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Establishment and utilization of an evaluation system for virucidal activity of disinfectants against a coronavirus with apparent applicability to SARS-CoV-2. Decontamination of pathogens on surfaces of substances is very important for controlling infectious diseases. In the present experiments, we tested various disinfectants in aqueous phase as well as on plastic surface carrying a viral inoculum, through dropping and wiping decontamination techniques, comparatively, so as to evaluate virucidal efficacies of those disinfectants toward an avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus: IBV). We regard this evaluation system applicable to SARS-CoV-2. The disinfectants evaluated were 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH)2) solution, sodium hypochlorite at 500 or 1,000 ppm of total chlorine (NaClO-500 or NaClO-1,000, respectively), NaClO at 500 ppm of total chlorine in 0.17% FdCa(OH)2 (Mix-500) and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 500-fold in water (QAC-500). In the suspension test, all solutions inactivated IBV inoculum that contained 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under detectable level within 30 sec. In the carrier test, all solutions, except NaClO-500, could inactivate IBV with 0.5% FBS on a carrier to undetectable level in the wiping-sheets and wiped-carriers. We thus conclude that suspension and carrier tests should be introduced to evaluate disinfectants for the field usage, and that this evaluation system is important and workable for resultful selection of the tested disinfectants against avian coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, particularly on plastic fomite.Copyright © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.	false
0	Temporin G, an amphibian antimicrobial peptide against influenza and parainfluenza respiratory viruses: Insights into biological activity and mechanism of action. Treatment of respiratory viral infections remains a global health concern, mainly due to the inefficacy of available drugs. Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2.

0	Experience of clinical screening for COVID-19 among patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgeries: an alternative proposal. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the largest global event in recent times, with millions of infected people and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Colombia has also been affected by the pandemic, including by the cancellation of medically necessary surgical procedures that were categorized as nonessential. The objective of this study was to show the results of the program implemented in two institutions in Bogota, Colombia, in April 2020 to support the performance of elective essential and nonessential low- and medium-complexity orthopedic surgeries during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved a presurgical clinical protocol without serological or molecular testing., METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study of a cohort of patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at two institutions in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in April 2020. We implemented a preoperative clinical protocol that did not involve serological or molecular tests; the protocol consisted of a physical examination, a survey of symptoms and contact with confirmed or suspected cases, and presurgical isolation. We recorded the types of surgeries, the patients' scores on the medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTs) scale, the presence of signs, symptoms, and mortality associated with COVID-19 developed after the operation., RESULTS: A total of 179 patients underwent orthopedic surgery. The average age was 47 years (Shapiro-Wilk, P = 0.021), and the range was between 18 and 81 years. There was a female predominance (61.5%). With regard to the types of surgeries, 86 (48%) were knee operations, 42 (23.5%) were hand surgeries, 34 (19%) were shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) were foot and ankle surgeries. The average MeNTs score was 44.6 points. During the 2 weeks after surgery, four patients were suspected of having COVID-19 because they developed at least two symptoms associated with the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 in the postoperative period was 2.3%. Two (1.1%) of these four patients visited an emergency department where RT-PCR tests were performed, and they tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19., CONCLUSION: Through the implementation of a presurgical clinical protocol consisting of a physical examination; a clinical survey inquiring about signs, symptoms, and epidemiological contact with suspected or confirmed cases; and presurgical isolation but not involving the performance of molecular or serological diagnostic tests, positive results were obtained with regard to the performance of low- and medium-complexity elective orthopedic surgeries in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.	false
0	1028 Managing gestational diabetes mellitus with telemedicine during COVID-19: was there an impact on pregnancy outcomes?. Objective: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, our Diabetes in Pregnancy Program became exclusively telemedicine. Prior studies have demonstrated telemedicine interventions improve outcomes, but there is limited data on the impact on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Our aim was to compare compliance and perinatal outcomes in women with GDM who participated in telemedicine versus in-person visits. Study Design: IRB-approved retrospective cohort study comparing those with GDM who received telemedicine diabetes care in March-June 2020 to those who received care in-person in March-June 2018. Primary perinatal outcomes were polyhydramnios, large for gestational age (LGA), shoulder dystocia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia, which were combined into a composite outcome for multivariable analysis. Result(s): 213 women met inclusion criteria: 109 in 2020 and 104 in 2018. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Women in 2020 had significantly greater HbA1C at diagnosis (5.4 vs 5.1%, p=0.0005), 3rd trimester average glucose (99.2 vs 96.9 mg/dL,p=0.02), 3rd trimester average fingersticks/day (3.7 vs 3.4,p<0.0001), and weight gain at delivery (p=0.02). The 2020 cohort had significantly fewer visits (4.6 vs 5.6,p<0.0001), visits with downloaded vs self-reported blood glucose data (3.5 vs 4.3,p=0.002) and antenatal ultrasounds (7.4 vs 9.4,p<0.0001). Attendance rates were higher for telemedicine and in-person visits in 2020 vs 2018 (97% vs 93%,p=0.007). No statistically significant differences were found in incidence of polyhydramnios (p=0.69), LGA (p=0.36), shoulder dystocia (p=1.00), hyperbilirubinemia (p=0.19) or hypoglycemia (p=0.70). After adjusting for maternal age and pregravid BMI, there was no association between maternal and neonatal composite outcome and cohort year (p=0.1139). Conclusion(s): Use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly affect perinatal outcomes, but did improve compliance among women with GDM who received care compared to historical controls. Our findings suggest telemedicine is an effective method for management of GDM. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Empiric evidence of ethnic disparities in coronavirus positivity in Washington State. OBJECTIVES: Early reports from the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic reveal ethnic disparities in coronavirus incidence, severity, and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020). RESULT(S): A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR=4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR=2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR=1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR=2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR=2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (r=0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (r=0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (r=0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (r=-0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45). CONCLUSION(S): We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State. Social determinants of health, such as occupation, housing, healthcare access, and community structure, may contribute to health disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Targeted capture of these variables in electronic health records is warranted to inform health equity analyses.	false
0	MODERN-LUNG: A phase 2 study of a moderately hypofractionated schedule of chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Background: Moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy entails higher doses per fraction given over shorter treatment time, and thus is more convenient for patients and provides economic benefits for both patients and the health care sector. Faster treatment delivery has become more tolerable due to advances in radiation technology and established as the standard of care in many breast and prostate cancer treatments. Lung cancer is a common cancer that is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is particularly prevalent in the elderly and socially disadvantaged and Aboriginal groups. In Australia, the standard of care for the treatment of unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 6 weeks of radiotherapy (2 Gy per fraction) given concurrently with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (CRT) followed by immunotherapy for up to 12 months. However, in the UK, a 4-week schedule of moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (2.75 Gy per fraction) with chemotherapy has been commonly used. Because of the priority to reduce hospital visits during the COVID 19 pandemic, some hospitals in Australia are using the 4-week schedule, but there are no published data on the tolerability of this shorter CRT schedule with immunotherapy and there are no phase 3 data comparing it directly with a 6-week schedule. The aim of this single-arm phase 2 study is to establish tolerability of the 4-week schedule prior to proceeding with a phase 3 trial comparing 4 weeks with 6 weeks. It will be multi-institutional study across NSW and other states. Aim(s): To assess the toxicity of using a 4-week schedule ofCRT followed by immunotherapy in unresectable stage 3 NSCLC. Method(s): A minimum of 50 patients will be recruited from the clinic to receive a 4-week schedule of CRT followed by immunotherapy for unresectable stage 3 NSCLC. All assessments, treatment delivery, and follow-up will be according to local guidelines. Toxicities and treatment outcomes will be measured. The primary endpoint is the incidence of major toxicities pertaining to thoracic radiotherapy, including Grade = 3 pneumonitis and Grade = 3 esophagitis. Statistics: There are stopping rules to the study if thresholds for severe esophagitis and pneumonitis incidence are exceeded. Outcomes will be analyzed according to descriptive and Kaplan-Meier method statistics. Current status of the study:Await local ethics approval of protocol in August 2020 and start recruitment atCMNby October 2020. Multisite recruitment by November 2020.	false

0	Effect of tocilizumab on clinical outcomes at 15 days in patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019: Randomised controlled trial. AbstractObjective To determine whether tocilizumab improves clinical outcomes for patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design Randomised, open label trial. Setting Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. Participants Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. Interventions Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). Main outcome measure The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. Results A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Conclusions In patients with severe or critical covid-19, tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving clinical outcomes at 15 days, and it might increase mortality.

0	Decline of humoral responses against SARS-COV-2 spike in convalescent individuals. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. Aim(s): While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment. However, whether the neutralization capacity of convalescent plasma is stabilized six weeks after symptom onset or decreases further remains unknown. Method(s): Here we performed repeated serological analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how humoral responses against the SARSCoV- 2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. Result(s): We observed that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including the receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. Summary/Conclusions: If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.	false
0	Therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma therapy in covid-19. Introduction: Convalescent plasma containing virus specific antibodies has been used before and was associated with reduced mortality during Spanish flu, SARS, and H1N1 influenza A pandemics. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has shown some benefits for cytokine clearance in sepsis with multiorgan failure in the past and in 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. We combined both therapies together for COVID-19 treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate safety and efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma therapy in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARSCOV-2) infections. Method(s): 6 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with one session TPE followed by 500 ml convalescent plasma transfusion in addition to standard treatment who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and life threatening illness (PAO2/FIO2 < 300 and mechanical ventilation, shock, organ failure). The study was conducted at Mediclinic City Hospital, Dubai, UAE from April 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020. Outcomes measured were death from any cause, time to negative SARS-COV-2 PCR, time to removal of mechanical ventilation after intervention, clinical (body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, PAO2/FIO2), biochemical (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, procalcitonin) and radiological parameters before and after therapy. Mechanical ventilation days, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay were also measured. Result(s): Patients were in the age range of 36-65 years, 4 males and two females. All patients were receiving mechanical ventilation, Methylprednisone and therapeutic anticoagulation. All the patients survived and were discharged home. Time to negative SARS-COV-2 RT PCR was 1-18 days and time to removal of mechanical ventilation was 2-41 days after intervention. Out of six, 4 patients were off mechanical ventilation within 7 days of therapy. 3 out of 6 patients had normal body temperature, 5 had improved PAO2/FIO2 within 48hrs. SOFA score improved by 2 points within 48 hrs in 3 patients and within 5 days in another 2 patients. All the biochemical parameters improved within 48 hrs except D-dimer which worsened in 3 patients after therapy. Chest X ray showed improvement in pulmonary lesions within 48 hrs and significant improvement by day 7. Mechanical ventilation days, ICU and hospital length of stay was 8-42, 10-42 and 20-60 days respectively. Conclusion(s): Critically ill Covid-19 patients with ARDS treated with therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma in addition to standard therapy showed improvements in clinical, laboratory, and virological parameters. Although this uncontrolled limited case series had very good success rate, further evaluation in clinical trials is necessary in order to corroborate the findings.	false
0	In silico comparative genomics of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the source and diversity of the pathogen in Bangladesh. The COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has severely affected most countries of the world including Bangladesh. We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available whole-genome sequences of 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh and 371 isolates from another 27 countries to predict possible transmission routes of COVID19 to Bangladesh and genomic variations among the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen was imported in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The viruses found in the southern district of Chattogram were closely related to strains from Saudi Arabia whereas those in Dhaka were similar to that of United Kingdom and France. The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh belonged to three clusters. Compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequence reported from China, the isolates in Bangladesh had a total of 180 mutations in the coding region of the genome, and 110 of these were missense. Among these, 99 missense mutations (90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures. Remarkably, a mutation that leads to an I300F change in the nsp2 protein and a mutation leading to D614G change in the spike protein were prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, and might have influenced the epidemiological properties of the virus in Bangladesh.	false

0	Vitamin D deficiency is inversely associated with COVID-19 incidence and disease severity in Chinese people. Background: Vitamin D might have beneficial potential in influencing the natural history of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Objective(s): The aim was to investigate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 incidence and disease severity in Chinese people. Method(s): In a cross-sectional study we retrospectively analyzed 335 COVID-19 patients (median: 56.0; IQR: 43.0-64.0 y) who were admitted to the Wuhan Tongji Hospital between 27 February and 21 March 2020. We also included an age- and sex-matched population of 560 individuals (median: 55; IQR: 49.0-60.0 y) who underwent the physical examination program. Their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured during the same period from 2018-2019. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured for all COVID-19 patients on admission. Severity of COVID-19 was determined based on the level of respiratory involvement. A general linear model with adjustment for covariates was used to compare 25(OH)D concentrations between the COVID-19 and 2018-2019 control groups. Adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity were estimated via multivariable logistic regression. Result(s): In the general linear model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and BMI, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients than the 2018-2019 controls [ln transformed values of 3.32 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.46 +/- 0.022 ln (nmol/L), P = 0.014]. Multivariable logistic regression showed that male sex (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.82), advanced age (>=65 y) (OR: 4.93; 95% CI: 1.44, 16.9), and vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) (OR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.23, 6.01) were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (all P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): These findings suggested that vitamin D deficiency impacts COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in the Chinese population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects of internet use during the COVID-19 Stay-at-home period: Prospective, quantitative survey study. Background: COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. Objective(s): The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. Method(s): This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. Result(s): The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. Conclusion(s): During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.Copyright © Cecilia Cheng, Yan-Ching Lau, Jeremy W Luk.	false
0	Country-level determinants of the severity of the first global wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: an ecological study. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the country-level determinants of the severity of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: Ecological study of publicly available data. Countries reporting >25 COVID-19 related deaths until 8 June 2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, population >65 years, average body mass index and smoking prevalence); economic parameters (gross domestic product per capita); environmental parameters (pollution levels and mean temperature (January-May); comorbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer); health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10 000 population); international arrivals; the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19; BCG vaccination coverage; UV radiation exposure; and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data., PRIMARY OUTCOME: Country-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase., PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK and the USA., RESULTS: Of all country-level determinants included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (95% CI -0.034 to -0.002)), were significantly associated with the natural logarithm of the mean death rate., CONCLUSIONS: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent related deaths. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Prevalence of Stress and Worry, Mental Health Conditions, and Increased Substance Use Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, April and May 2020. In 2019, approximately 51 million U.S. adults aged >=18 years reported any mental illness,* and 7.7% reported a past-year substance use disorder  (1). Although reported prevalence estimates of certain mental disorders, substance use, or substance use disorders are not generally higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, persons in these groups are often less likely to receive treatment services (1). Persistent systemic social inequities and discrimination related to living conditions and work environments, which contribute to disparities in underlying medical conditions, can further compound health problems faced by members of racial and ethnic minority groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and worsen stress and associated mental health concerns (2,3). In April and May 2020, opt-in Internet panel surveys of English-speaking U.S. adults aged >=18 years were conducted to assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health conditions and initiation of or increases in substance use to cope with stress, psychosocial stressors, and social determinants of health. Combined prevalence estimates of current depression, initiating or increasing substance use, and suicidal thoughts/ideation were 28.6%, 18.2%, and 8.4%, respectively. Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) adults reported a higher prevalence of psychosocial stress related to not having enough food or stable housing than did adults in other racial and ethnic groups. These estimates highlight the importance of population-level and tailored interventions for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention, substance use prevention, screening and treatment services, and increased provision of resources to address social determinants of health. How Right Now (Que Hacer Ahora) is an evidence-based and culturally appropriate communications campaign designed to promote and strengthen the emotional well-being and resiliency of populations adversely affected by COVID-19-related stress, grief, and loss (4).	false
0	A Novel System of 'Split Ventilation' using electronically controlled valves can be used to deliver modified lung protective ventilation in a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Introduction: During surges in demand for ventilator capacity, demand may outstrip supply. Split ventilation has been suggested as a temporising measure for individual hospitals to cope with such surges in demand. Optimising split ventilation may be important in the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated high prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We developed a low cost electronically controlled system for delivering split ventilation, provisionally termed the Combiventilate system. Objective(s): 1) To demonstrate that an electronically controlled split ventilation system could be used to delivery independent volumecontrolled ventilation to two test lungs under conditions of varying resistance, compliance and leak. 2) To demonstrate that in a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the Combiventilate system could deliver independent modified lung protective ventilation. 3) To show that in a porcine model of ARDS, markers of ventilator induced lung injury were similar in Cobiventilate ventilated animals and single ventilated animals. 4) To demonstrate that with minimal training, critical care staff could independently operate the Combiventilate system in simulated clinical scenarios. Method(s): We performed benchtop testing of the Combiventilate system using linear test lungs to ensure it's ability to provide differential ventilation and accommodate for changes in respiratory mechanics. We established a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by administering intrabronchial hydrochloric acid. We compared ventilation using the Combiventialte system to traditional individual ventilation in both injured and uninjured animals (n = 30). Groups were; individually ventilated uninjured (n = 5), individually ventilated injured (n = 5), Combiventilate managed uninjured (n = 10) and Combiventilate managed injured (n = 10). We compared between group differences in the ability to deliver lung protective ventilation and meet gas exchange targets over a period of 6 hours of mechanical ventilation. We also compared immunological and histological markers of ventilator induced lung injury between groups. We performed benchtop simulations of clinical scenarios to verify that, with minimal training, clinical staff could set up and operate the Combiventilate system under conditions simulating common clinical scenarios. Result(s): The Combiventilate system was able to deliver individualised volume-controlled ventilation in benchtop testing with linear test lungs. In a porcine model of ARDS, the Combiventilate system was able to facilitate similar adherence to modified lung protective ventilation as compared to individual traditional ventilation. Immunological and histological markers of ventilator induced lung injury were similar in the Combiventilate managed groups compared to the traditionally ventilated groups. In benchtop simulations, clinical staff were able to set up and operate the Combiventilate system with minimal training. Conclusion(s): Performance of the Combiventilate system in benchtop testing and in a large animal model of ARDS supports the ability to deliver modified lung protective ventilation. Similar degrees of ventilator induced lung injury as observed in the Combiventilate group as compared to the individually ventilated group. These data are promising and support further efforts to develop and investigate this system for use in humans as a temporising measure when surge demand exceeds capacity for indivualised ventilation.	false
0	786 Neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with diagnosis of COVID-19. Objective: It is unclear whether infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that a diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from two labor and delivery units with universal COVID-19 testing policy between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who delivered during the study period and underwent testing for COVID-19 at any point in their pregnancy were eligible. The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal respiratory morbidity defined as the occurrence of any one of the following: respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, and need for respiratory support. The risk of neonatal morbidity with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis were compared using univariable and multivariable analyses. Stratified analysis compared the risks of adverse neonatal outcomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 to those without COVID-19. Result(s): Of 515 subjects meeting inclusion criteria, 55 (10.7%) tested positive for COVID-19; 19 (34.6%) were asymptomatic and 36 (65.4%) were symptomatic. No neonate tested positive for COVID-19. Rates of the primary outcome, composite neonatal respiratory morbidity, were not significantly different in patients with and without COVID-19 (21.8% vs 19.6%, P=0.692). There was no significant difference in the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity in a Cox regression model accounting for time from diagnosis to delivery, and adjusting for gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, and maternal diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.62; 95% CI 0.35, 1.09). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or symptomatic (Table). Conclusion(s): A diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of neonatal morbidity. These data may be useful in counseling women diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Delirium in older patients with COVID-19: prevalence, risk factors and clinical relevance. BACKGROUND: Delirium prevalence increases with age and is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for delirium in older patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as its association with length of stay and mortality., METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged >= 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. Data were collected from computerized medical records and all patients had delirium assessment at admission. Risk factors for delirium as well as the outcomes mentioned above were studied by two-group comparison, logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models., RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 48 (20.4%) presented with delirium, which was hypoactive in 41.6% of cases, hyperactive and mixed in 35.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Patients with cognitive impairment had a nearly four times higher risk of developing delirium compared to patients that were cognitively normal before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 3.7; 1.7-7.9 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of delirium did not modify the time from symptoms' onset to hospitalization nor the length of stay in acute care, but it was associated with an increased risk of dying (HR 2.1; 1.2-3.7 95%CI; p=0.0113)., CONCLUSION: Delirium was a prevalent condition in older people admitted with COVID-19 and pre-existing cognitive impairment was its main risk factor. Delirium was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. These results highlight the importance of early recognition of delirium especially when pre-morbid cognitive comorbidities are present.

0	Prevalence of COVID-19 in Louisiana and Its Association With Race, Concentrated Disadvantage, Chronic Disease Prevalence and Other Social Determinants of Health. Purpose: Our purpose was to evaluate the association between social determinants of health and concentrated disadvantage (CDI), incorporating race and major chronic diseases with the prevalence and mortality of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Louisiana and Orleans Parish. Method(s): Sample population was census tracts in Louisiana. Data sources included: 2018 American Community Survey, the US Census Bureau, and the Louisiana Department of Health. Negative binomial regression was use to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and CDI, rates of chronic disease, and other housing and socioeconomic variables: models were further adjusted for cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes. Result(s): As of June 29, there were 57,081 COVID-19 cases within Louisiana and 7,796 in Orleans Parish. In Louisiana, mean prevalence of COVID-19 was 11.21 +/- 8.65 per 1,000 cases and in Orleans Parish mean prevalence was 17.06 +/- 7.43 per 1,000 cases. In Orleans parish, there was an 11% increased risk of COVID-19 associated with CDI at the census track; %Black, %female headed-households, and %below poverty had the highest association at the census track level. CDI predicted COVID-19 with a risk ratio of 1.09 (Cl 95% 1.08, 1.10). When considering the prevalence of HTN, CVD, and diabetes, the association of CDI with increased risk of COVID-19 was reduced. Conclusion(s): There is a strong correlation between prevalence of disease in association with areas of concentrated disadvantage and other socioeconomic domains; and therefore impact the risk of disease in minority populations, as seen through the rates of infection and deaths in the Black community due to COVID.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"1111 Increased rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are common complications of pregnancy that can result in severe maternal and neonatal morbidity without timely diagnosis. We postulated that with a shift towards telemedicine and reduced in-person visits, fewer women would be diagnosed with HDP and that rates of maternal morbidity would be higher. Study Design: We compared singleton deliveries at the four largest volume hospitals within one healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic (April - July 2020 during a statewide recommended ""stay-at-home"" order) to those in a pre-COVID era (April - July 2019). Deliveries complicated by HDP were identified by ICD-10 codes; 25% of these charts were further reviewed for accuracy. Overall rates of disease and markers of disease severity were compared between the two groups. Result(s): Our cohort included 9,980 deliveries: 5,015 in 2020 and 4,965 in 2019. Patient characteristics including age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and insurance type did not differ significantly between the two groups. There were statistically more nulliparous women in the 2020 cohort (47.7% vs. 44.9%; p<0.01). There was an increase in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy during the COVID era (9.0% vs. 6.9%; p<0.01), which was significant in both the nulliparous (11.8% vs. 9.7%; p=0.02) and multiparous (6.5% vs. 4.7%; p<0.01) populations. There was similarly an increase in the rate of labor inductions performed for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (6.9% of all births in 2020 vs. 5.7% in 2019; p=0.02). Among women with HDP, gestational age at delivery did not differ between the two cohorts, nor did the incidence of severe features or markers of severe disease (Table). Conclusion(s): We found a statistically significant 23% increase in the rate of HDP during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was no increase in the severity of disease nor in gestational age at delivery, suggesting that changes in outpatient protocols did not significantly alter timely diagnosis. More investigation is warranted to understand the increased prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy that we identified. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Frequency and characterization of ancillary chest CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: Ground-glass opacity and consolidation are recognized typical features of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia on Chest CT, yet ancillary findings have not been fully described. We aimed to describe ancillary findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT, to define their prevalence, and investigate their association with clinical data. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed our CT chest cases with coupled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Patients with negative rt-PCR or without admission chest CT were excluded. Ancillary findings included: vessel enlargement, subpleural curvilinear lines, dependent subpleural atelectasis, centrilobular solid nodules, pleural and/or pericardial effusions, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Continuous data were expressed as median and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and tested by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULT(S): Ancillary findings were represented by 106/252 (42.1%, 36.1 to 48.2) vessel enlargement, 50/252 (19.8%, 15.4 to 25.2) subpleural curvilinear lines, 26/252 (10.1%, 7.1 to 14.7) dependent subpleural atelectasis, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) pleural effusion, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, 13/252 (5.2%, 3 to 8.6) centrilobular solid nodules, and 6/252 (2.4%, 1.1 to 5.1) pericardial effusion. Air space disease was more extensive in patients with vessel enlargement or centrilobular solid nodules (p < 0.001). Vessel enlargement was associated with longer history of fever (p = 0.035) and lower admission oxygen saturation (p = 0.014); dependent subpleural atelectasis with lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001) and higher respiratory rate (p < 0.001); mediastinal lymph nodes with shorter history of cough (p = 0.046); centrilobular solid nodules with lower prevalence of cough (p = 0.023), lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001), and higher respiratory rate (p = 0.032), and pericardial effusion with shorter history of cough (p = 0.015). Ancillary findings associated with longer hospital stay were subpleural curvilinear lines (p = 0.02), whereas centrilobular solid nodules were associated with higher rate of intensive care unit admission (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Typical high-resolution CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are frequently associated with ancillary findings that variably associate with disease extent, clinical parameters, and disease severity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Ancillary findings might reflect the broad range of heterogeneous mechanisms in severe acute respiratory syndrome from viral pneumonia, and potentially help disease phenotyping.	false
0	Clinical laboratory characteristics in patients with suspected COVID-19: One single-institution experience. Objectives: Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. Method(s): In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for an interleukin-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. Result(s): Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and nonsurvivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. Conclusion(s): This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin, and LDH could help the clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients. However, this data needs to be further validated in a larger population.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"An Overview of Nucleic Acid Testing for the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this note we analyze the problems in the nucleic acid testing (NAT) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and we also give some suggestions for improving the accuracy of NAT diagnosis. NAT testing is considered to be the diagnostic ""gold standard""; at present there are few reviews on NAT for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, many false-negative results always appear in the procedure of detecting, which has affected early diagnosis of the disease and brought a great challenge to mitigation and containment of the pandemic. In conclusion, comprehensive analyses of serological and imaging findings should be performed to guide the formulation of an accurate clinical diagnosis, treatment plan, and monitoring therapeutic efficacy, in an effort to achieve early diagnosis, containment, and treatment of the disease, thereby effectively reducing progression of the pandemic. This article presents a literature overview of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, aiming to provide support for clinicians. Copyright © 2021 Wang, Li, Zhao, Li and Ai."	false
0	Inflammatory and hematologic markers as predictors of severe outcomes in COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Laboratory testing is commonly performed in patients with COVID-19. Each of the laboratory parameters has potential value for risk stratification and prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the difference between these parameters in severe and nonsevere disease and to provide the optimal cutoff value for predicting severe disease. Method(s): We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. Result(s): There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies. Our meta-analysis suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 infections have higher procalcitonin, (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI 0.05-0.10; p < 0.00001), CRP (mean difference 36.88; 95% CI 29.10-44.65; p < 0.00001), D-Dimer (mean difference 0.43; 95% CI 0.31-0.56; p < 0.00001), and LDH (mean difference 102.79; 95% CI 79.10-126.49; p < 0.00001) but lower levels of albumin (mean difference -4.58; 95% CI -5.76 to -3.39; p < 0.00001) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 infections. The cutoff values for the parameters were 0.065 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 38.85 g/L for albumin, 33.55 mg/L for CRP, 0.635 mu/L for D-dimer, and 263.5 U/L for LDH, each with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis suggests elevated procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH and decreased albumin can be used for predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Documentation of plateau pressures and the incidence of high plateau pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Introduction: Elevated Plateau Pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS have previously been shown to increase the time needed for liberation from mechaincal ventilation, increase the lenght of ICU stay and increase hospital mortality (1,2). International guidelines for the management of ARDS, including ARDS secondary to COVID-19, reflect these findings and recommend maintaining plateau pressures of less than 30 cmH2O (3). Objective(s): 1. To assess how frequently Plateau Pressures were recorded in mechanically ventilated patients admitted with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. 2. To investigate the incidence of elevated plateau pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Method(s): This was a retrospective audit of all patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 admitted to the ICU over a three month period (06/03/2020-06/06/2020) who required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Data was collected from patient's medical notes, including both paper charts as well as digital documentation. Data was also collected from patient's flow charts. Data was only collected on days during which the patient was mechanically ventilated on a Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC), Pressure Control (PC) or Volume control (VC) mode of ventilation. Elevated plateau pressures were defined as a pressure greater than or equal to 30 cmH2O. Result(s): 24 patients were admitted to the ICU with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 during this time period. They spent a cumulative total of 428 days intubated and ventilated in ICU during this time. The total number of days spent on a PRVC, PC or VC mode of ventilation was 262. This was broken down as 250 days on PRVC, 8 days on PC and 4 days on VC. In total, plateau pressures were recorded on 47% of days while on a PRVC, PC or VC mode of ventilation (124 of the 262 days). There was a documented contraindication to recording plateau pressures on 2 out of the 262 days. Of the recorded plateau pressures, 29.8% were greater than or equal to 30 cmH20 (37 of the 124 measurements). Conclusion(s): We found that for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19, plateau pressures were not being measured routinely and were frequently found to be above the threshold limit recommended by international guidelines. This could have implications for patient's length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation as well as hospital mortality.	false
0	Covid-19 and blood groups: ABO antibody levels may also matter. Background: Susceptibility to Covid-19 has been found to be associated with the ABO blood group, with O type individuals being at a lower risk. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Covid-19 patients might have lower levels of ABO antibodies than non-infected individuals as they could offer some degree of protection. Method(s): After showing that the viral spike protein harbors the ABO glycan epitopes when produced by cells expressing the relevant glycosyltransferases, like upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, we enrolled 290 patients with Covid-19 and 276 asymptomatic controls to compare their levels of natural ABO blood group antibodies. Result(s): We found significantly lower IgM anti-A + anti-B agglutination scores in blood group O patients (76.93 vs 88.29, P-value = 0.034) and lower levels of anti-B (24.93 vs 30.40, P-value = 0.028) and anti-A antibodies (28.56 vs 36.50, P-value = 0.048) in blood group A and blood group B patients, respectively, compared to controls. Conclusion(s): In this study, we showed that ABO antibody levels are significantly lower in Covid-19 patients compared to controls. These findings could indicate that patients with low levels of ABO antibodies are at higher risk of being infected.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Comparison of the quidel sofia SARS FIA test to the hologic aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA test for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic outpatients. The Quidel Sofia severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) test (SOFIA) is a rapid antigen immunoassay for the detection of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins from nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the SOFIA test to those of the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA test (APTIMA TMA), a high-throughput molecular diagnostic test that uses transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from upper respiratory tract specimens. Three hundred forty-seven symptomatic patients from an urgent care center in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections were tested in parallel using nasal swabs for the SOFIA test and nasopharyngeal swabs for the APTIMA TMA test. The SOFIA test demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 82.0% with the APTIMA TMA test for symptomatic patients tested#5days from symptom onset and a PPA of 54.5% for symptomatic patients.5days from symptom onset. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test was used to determine the cycle threshold (CT) value for any specimens that were discrepant between the SOFIA and APTIMA TMA tests. Using a CT value of#35 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 culture positivity, we estimate that the SOFIA test detected 87.2% of symptomatic patients tested#5days from symptom onset who were likely to be culture positive.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	Comparative Analysis of Intravenous Pumps Relocation for Critically Ill Isolated COVID-19 Patients From Bedside to Outside the Patient Room. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of IV pump relocation for COVID-19 patients from the bedside to outside the patient room on nurse exposure to COVID-19 and conservation of PPE., DESIGN: Original Article., SETTING: Intensive care units at a single-center teaching hospital., PATIENTS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients under contact and special droplet precautions., INTERVENTIONS: Relocation of intravenous pumps for COVID-19 patients from bedside to outside the patient room using extension tubing., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to measure the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 exposure, utilizing the number of nurse entries into the patient room as a surrogate endpoint, and extrapolation of this data to determine the reduction or PPE usage. Secondary endpoints included incidence of extravasation, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and diagnosis of CLABSI/bacteremia. A statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint of the study was observed as room entries prior to pump relocation averaged 15.36 (+/- 4.10) as opposed to an average of 7.92 (+/- 2.19) following pump relocation (p < 0.0001). In both pre- and post-pump relocation groups, there was no incidence of extravasation or CLABSI. No significant differences were noted in number of patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypotensive episodes, or bacteremia., CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant decrease in COVID-19 exposure based on the number of nurse entries following the relocation of intravenous pumps from inside to outside of the patient room. These results may be cautiously extrapolated to suggest a decrease in personal protective equipment utilization. Future prospective, randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of this strategy are required.	false
0	Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Use of Radiopharmaceuticals in the Context of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has devastated the healthcare systems and economies of over 200 countries in just a few months. The etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted by asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers alike. While in vitro testing techniques have allowed for population-wide screening, prognostic tools are required to assess the disease severity and therapeutic response, contributing to improve the patient clinical outcomes. Moreover, no specific antiviral against COVID-19 exists at the time of publication, severely limiting treatment against the infection. Hence, there is an urgent clinical need for innovative therapeutic strategies that may contribute to manage the COVID-19 outbreak and prevent future pandemics. Herein, we critically examine recent diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic advancements for COVID-19 in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. First, we summarize the gold standard techniques used to diagnose COVID-19, including in vitro assays and imaging techniques, and then discuss how radionuclide-based nuclear imaging provides complementary information for prognosis and treatment management of infected patients. Second, we introduce new emerging types of radiotherapies that employ radioimmunoconjugates, which have shown selective cytotoxic response in oncological studies, and critically analyze how these compounds could be used as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, this Perspective further discusses the emerging applications of radionuclides to study the behavior of pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 aerosol particles.

0	Immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients including young infants. Pediatric cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are generally mild or asymptomatic, and are usually detected by virological examination following close contact with COVID-19 patients, often the children's parents. The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric patients with COVID-19, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of four children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Clinical characteristics of 3 patients infected with COVID-19: Age, interleukin 6 (IL-6), lymphopenia, and variations in chest computed tomography (CT). Objective: Background: Case Reports: Conclusion(s): Unknown ethiology COVID-19 has been identified as the cause of the large outbreak of pneumonia in patients in Wuhan with shared history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market; however, there is more to learn about this disease. Some experts report that the virus may have reduced toxicity during transmission, but others say that toxicity does not change during transmission. In this case series, we report clinical and imaging characteristics of 3 patients (A, B, and C) infected with COVID-19. In an exposure-tracking epidemiological investigation, we found that it is possible that Patient A transmitted the infection to her treating physician, Patient B. Patient B then likely transmitted the infection to her family member, Patient C. From the chest CT studies and clinical characteristics, we postulate that the virulence did not decrease during human-to-human transmission. In previous studies, patients with the virus infection had changes in chest CT; however, we found that during the early stages of this disease, some patients (Patient C) may have normal chest CT scans and laboratory studies. Most importantly, we found that IL-6 levels were highest and lymphocyte count was lowest in those with more severe infection. In this case series, we report the exposure relationship of the 3 patients and found that chest CT scans may not have any changes at the beginning of this disease. Lymphopenia and elevated levels of IL-6 can be found after infection.Copyright © Am J Case Rep, 2020.	false

0	Characteristics of Three Different Chemiluminescence Assays for Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies. Several tests based on chemiluminescence immunoassay techniques have become available to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35 days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multigroup study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n = 145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e., healthy blood donors, n = 191, and healthcare workers, n = 1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 7), and endemic common-cold coronavirus infections (n = 12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers' cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval [84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation. Copyright © 2021 Myriam C.

0	Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales causing secondary infections during the COVID-19 crisis at a New York City hospital. BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for secondary bacterial infections with MDR pathogens, including carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). OBJECTIVE(S): We sought to rapidly investigate the clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULT(S): We identified 31 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K. pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3); one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSION(S): While CPE prevalence has declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future impact.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Can noble metal coating reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP): A multicenter double blind randomized pilot study. Introduction: Ventilator associated pneumonia is still a problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Noble metal coating of endotracheal tubes reduces the adhesion of bacteria and could reduce the incidence of VAP. Method(s): A controlled prospective randomized, double blind, multicenter study was launched in November 2018 in Liege, Belgium enrolling 324 patients from 8 ICUs from 4 sites of two hospital institutions using endotracheal tubes for ventilated patients from Bactiguard. These tubes with subglottic suctioning had, for half of them, a thin coating of noble metals (gold, silver and palladium) firmly attached to their surfaces, preventing bacteria from adhering and forming biofilm. Coated tubes were indistinguishable from control tubes. Coated and control tubes were coded and remained blinded for all the participants. Patients were followed during ventilation and ICU stay up to 28 days. Tracheal colonization, incidence of VAP, and antibiotic consumption were recorded. Result(s): The study ended on 5 March 2020 before the Covid-19 pandemic occurrence in Liege. Data are given as a whole because the code is not yet broken. This will be done before the European convention. Among the 324 patients with a median age of 67.5 (IQR 56,5- 74,6), there were 179 men (55.4%). Their mean Charlson score was 2 (IQR 1-4) and the mean saps II score, calculated the day of intubation, was 50.5 +/- 17.5. The median length of ventilation through both uncoated and coatedtubes was 5 days (IQR 3-9) totaling 2202 ventilatory days. No bacteria were found in tracheal sputum from 122 patients during ventilation. Persistence of bacteria already present in tracheal sputum the day of intubation was documented in 38 patients and new bacteria were found in 76 patients. No sampling was done in 88 patients, partially because of too short ventilation (n = 26). During ventilation and 2 days after extubation, there were 55 suspected episodes of VAP. The analysis of these episodes based on the presence of new infiltrate on X-ray exam, fever, leucocytosis, increase of the FiO2 or Peep level, quantitative bacteriological result and CRP change, leads to reject 25 suspicions and classifies the 30 other as confirmed (n = 2), probable (n = 12) or possible (n = 16). The overall incidence of VAP was 13.7/1000 ventilatory days or 9.3/100 patients. Antibiotic from any kind was used during 68.7 % of ventilatory days and 61.7% of ICU days. ICU mortality was 41.9 % and hospital mortality was 50.8%. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of a randomized double blind study with Bactiguard tubes which will allow to define the number of patients for a confirmatory larger study.	false
0	A retrospective analysis of unit acquired infections in a west london adult intensive care unit during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Introduction: Unit acquired blood infections are commonly used as a quality indicator. Intensive care units report such data quarterly and this is collected by ICNARC(1). West Middlesex University Hospital (WMUH) has a high turnover AICU, with 199 and 167 admissions for quarters 1 and 2 respectively in 2019. From April to December 2019, WMUH had reported 0 unit acquired infections. Nationally, an increase in secondary bacterial infections in COVID ICU patients has been reported(2). Studies have reported 50% of COVID patients who died had secondary bacterial infections(3). Objective(s): To compare the incidence of unit acquired infections during the COVID-19 pandemic with a typical pre-pandemic period. Method(s): We included 74 patients over a 55-day period. Patients were confirmed COVID positive from throat or tracheal aspirate swab PCR. Data was extracted from the ICE reporting system. Unit acquired infections were deemed to be positive blood cultures greater than 48 hours after admission. Result(s): Thirteen patients had a unit acquired infection. There were 16 positive blood cultures in total, as some had more than one positive culture during admission. Cases are broken down by organism, see Figure 1. Average length of time from admission to positive blood culture was 14.4 days. The length of stay for all 74 COVID positive ICU patients was 12.6 days compared to 25.8 days for those who developed unit acquired infection. 32 out of 74 COVID patients died (43.2%). 7 of the 13 patients with a positive blood culture died (53.8%). Conclusion(s): We have demonstrated an unexpected increase in unit acquired infections during the COVID pandemic. 17.5% of patients developed a unit acquired infection, compared to 0% over a similar time period in 2019. This is almost certainly multifactorial, with the average length of stay and exposure to invasive procedures a significant risk factor in developing infection (1). During the height of the pandemic, WMUH AICU was expanded from an 11-bed unit with a maximum of 6 level 3 beds to 35 level 3 beds. We can speculate that increasing the nursing ratio from standard 1:1 to 1:4.5 patients, as seen on an international level (3), along with multiple proned patients, made it challenging to maintain usual strict infection control measures. In particular, proned patients with CVCs sited in the internal jugular vein may have been at a greater risk of contamination from organism containing oro-pharygeal secretions. Additionally, lines were inserted in closed spaces whilst wearing heavy PPE, making sterility challenging. Once in situ lines could be contaminated when disconnecting during patient turning, as reported at other ICUs (2). These patients were also physiologically unstable, receiving multiple courses of antibiotics and iatrogenic immuno-suppression with steroids. It is therefore not unreasonable that this group of patients developed secondary infection.	false
0	953 Risk of cervical shortening and spontaneous preterm births during the COVID19 pandemic. Objective: Data are mixed regarding preterm birth (PTB) rates during the COVID19 pandemic, with many reports suggesting a decrease in PTB. We sought to determine the rates of short cervix and PTB in our cohort during the pandemic. Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of women with singleton gestations presenting for anatomical survey between 16 and 24 weeks and delivering at a single-institution in NYC, where universal transvaginal cervical length (TVCL) screening is performed at anatomical survey and universal testing for COVID19 is performed at delivery. Included women had TVCL measurements between March and May, 2020 and delivered before 8/17/2020. Women with incomplete outcome data were excluded. Our primary outcome, cervical shortening, defined as TVCL <2.5cm was compared between exposure groups: women who ever tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or IgG positive by serology at any time during the pregnancy and those testing negative. Secondary outcomes included spontaneous PTB (sPTB), preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and other adverse perinatal outcomes. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records and compared between groups. The rate of sPTB was then compared to a historical cohort in the same delivery time period. Result(s): 316 women were included. Hispanics were disproportionally affected by COVID19 (Table 1). Of 60 COVID+ women, 33 (55%) women had positive RT-PCR, most with mild symptoms, and 53 (88%) women had positive IgG near delivery. There were no cases of short cervix in the positive group. The data suggest a higher rate of PPROM in the positive group but after controlling for confounders, our numbers were too small to confirm this difference (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 0.84-6.46) (Table 2). Similarly, there was no difference in sPTB rates between the groups (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 0.48-3.75). Further, there was no difference in sPTB relative to the same time period in 2019 (2.9% vs 3.1%, p=0.68). Conclusion(s): In our cohort, COVID19 RT-PCR or IgG positive patients had a similar to slightly increased odds of cervical shortening, sPTB, and PPROM compared to negative patients.

0	Adaptation of Elecsys R anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoassay to dried blood spots: proof of concept. Aim: Several automated immunoassays have been validated on serum/plasma to evaluate the presence of significant levels of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies, signs of a present or past infection, but the use of dried blood spots (DBS) would facilitate sampling, shipping and storage. Objective: The aim of this project was to give proof of concept of the possibility to use of the automatized Elecsys R anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay with a volumetric DBS device. Results: Linearity and correlation were satisfactory between volumetric DBS and plasma. A cut-off value was suggested and should be validated with more samples. Conclusion:  this study strongly support the possibility to work with volumetric DBS instead of serum/plasma to test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.	false
0	547 Neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 positive mothers. Objective: To evaluate neonatal morbidity in mothers with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women delivered at ProMedica Health care system was performed from March to August 2020. All scheduled term pregnant patients underwent universal nasopharyngeal COVID-19 qRT-PCR 48 hours prior to delivery. Positive patients were triaged over the phone for symptoms. Positive patients were identified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical disease according to SMFM guidelines. Newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) from neonate nasopharyngeal swabs at 24 and 48 h after delivery. Neonatal morbidity due to COVID-19 was identified as positive test at birth, low APGAR score, O2 therapy, fever or extended stay due to respiratory complications. Result(s): 2357 deliveries occurred out of which 1165 pregnant patients (44.4%) were universally tested. Ten out of 1165 (0.9%) mothers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during preadmission universal screening. Eight (0.7%) were asymptomatic at the time of delivery, two developed (0.2%) mild disease at the time of admission. There was no (0/7) positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 from newborns delivered from positive mothers. No significant difference in neonatal morbidity noticed when compared to newborns of negative SARS-CoV-2 mothers during the same timeframe (Table 1). Conclusion(s): There was no significant difference in neonatal outcomes of newborns delivered from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease. No cases of vertical transmission observed among neonates delivered from COVID-19 positive mothers. None of the newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 disease which delivered either at local hospital or tertiary care hospital were transferred to NICU. Based on a small cohort, delivery of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease does not seem to require higher level of neonatal care. This approach will prevent unnecessary burden on tertiary health care system during COVID-19 pandemic. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	159 Utility of universal preadmission COVID-19 testing in labor and delivery unit at local community hospital. Objective: To estimate prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant (carriers) through universal preadmission L&D screening at local community hospitals system located in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of universal COVID-19 testing in pregnant was performed at ProMedica Health care system from March to September 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19 pandemic our health care elected to follow universal preadmission L&D screening and universal use of PPE strategy aimed to protect healthcare workers and prevent spread of new coronavirus infection. It was believed that pregnant women are at higher risk for COVID-19 as compared to general population. All scheduled term pregnant patients underwent universal nasopharyngeal COVID-19 qRT-PCR 48 hours prior to delivery. Positive patients were triaged over the phone for symptoms. Positive patients were identified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical disease according to SMFM guidelines. Result(s): 2357 deliveries occurred during study timeframe, out of which 1399 pregnant patients (59.4%) were eligible for universal testing. Among 1399 pregnant who were scheduled for preadmission L&D SARS-CoV-2 screening, 1165 (83.3%) underwent testing prior to scheduled hospital admission, 202 (14.4%) delivered prior to scheduled test and 32 (2.3%) patient declined testing. Out of 1165 screened, 10 (0.9%) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Two out of 1165 (0.2%) developed mild symptoms and 8 (0.7%) were asymptomatic. 1155 (99.1%) were tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (Fig.1). Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriers among scheduled for L&D admission in ProMedica Health care system were 0.7% from March to August 2020. This carrier rate is almost similar to general population rate in Ohio (1.2%)2 and Michigan (1.2%)2 during both surges in cases (Fig. 2). Based on our small cohort, it appears that COVID-19 carrier rate is similar between pregnant and general population. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 Conspiracy Beliefs: Relations with Anxiety, Quality of Life, and Schemas. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has produced a worldwide mental health crisis. Conspiracy beliefs regarding the origin of COVID-19 are prevalent, however, mental health consequences and factors associated with the likelihood of endorsing COVID-19 conspiracy theories have not yet been examined. The current study examined predictors and mental health consequences of conspiracy beliefs., Methods: Participants in Canada and the United States were surveyed via Amazon Mechanical Turk in April 2020 (N= 797), approximately one month after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and again in May 2020 (N= 395)., Results: Approximately half of the sample (49.7%) believed at least one conspiracy theory. Greater Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs were associated with more anxiety at follow up but not quality of life. Religiosity/spirituality, not knowing someone at high-risk for COVID-19, and non-white ethnicity were associated with greater conspiracy beliefs. Lower positive other-schemas were associated with greater conspiracy beliefs, only at low and moderate levels of positive self-schemas., Conclusions: There is substantial conspiracy belief endorsement during the COVID-19 pandemic and conspiracy beliefs are associated with anxiety, but not quality of life. Positive self-schemas protect against believing conspiracy theories and interventions to increase positive self-schemas may be effective to reduce the negative effects of conspiracy beliefs.

0	An integrative look at SARS-CoV-2 (Review). SARS-coV-2 is a newly discovered member of the betacoronaviruses and the etiological agent of the disease cOVId-19. SARS-coV-2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS-coV or MERS-CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS-coV-2, cOVId-19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS-coV-2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (AcE-2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with cOVId-19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS-coV-2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of cOVId-19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events. The development of novel therapies and vaccines designed to control and regulate a proper immune system response will be key to clinical management, prevention measures and effective population screening to attenuate the transmission of this novel RNA virus.Copyright © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

0	Low rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with active cancer diagnosis in a nonendemic region in the United States. Introduction: The mortality rate in cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 has been cited to be as high as 13% amidst a global pandemic. Here we present the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients with active cancer in a nonendemic cancer center at the time of the study. Method(s): All adult patients with an active history of cancer undergoing any elective surgery were screened for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, including fever >= 38 degrees Celsius, chills, dyspnea, cough, sputum production, pharyngitis, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, anosmia, and nasal discharge. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 preoperatively via nasopharyngeal swab within 48 hours of surgery using an RT-PCR assay. Active cancer was defined as receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation within 1 year of the SARS-CoV-2 test. Deidentified, institutional review board-exempt patient data were analyzed with IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26. Result(s): Between March 16, 2020 and June 30, 2020, a total of 227 patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64.0 years (range 21 to 90). The majority of the cohort were White. Only 2 patients (0.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. One 73-year-old woman undergoing hip replacement had Stage IV breast cancer and a 75-year-old man undergoing port placement had Stage IV retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. Neither patient had symptoms of SARSCoV-2, underwent hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2, or proceeded to have the scheduled surgery after the positive test results until a 14-day quarantine period and a subsequent negative test result. Both patients subsequently received the procedures they were originally scheduled for with no complications. Conclusion(s): Careful consideration of resource allocation and treatment limitations for cancer patients should occur in lower endemic regions.Copyright © 2020 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and The Medical College of Wisconsin, Inc.	false
0	"From conifers to cognition: Microbes, brain and behavior. A diversity of bacteria, protozoans and viruses (""endozoites"") were recently uncovered within healthy tissues including the human brain. By contrast, it was already recognized a century ago that healthy plants tissues contain abundant endogenous microbes (""endophytes""). Taking endophytes as an informative precedent, we overview the nature, prevalence, and role of endozoites in mammalian tissues, centrally focusing on the brain, concluding that endozoites are ubiquitous in diverse tissues. These passengers often remain subclinical, but they are not silent. We address their routes of entry, mechanisms of persistence, tissue specificity, and potential to cause long-term behavioral changes and/or immunosuppression in mammals, where rabies virus is the exemplar. We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Toxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia. We conclude that endozoites are instrumental in the delicate balance between health and disease, including age-related brain disease, and that endozoites have played an important role in the evolution of brain function and human behavior.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Targets and assay types for COVID-19 diagnosis. The lack of complete information on the immune response dynamics to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the use of mainly molecular tests such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). Although remarkable progress has been made in developing effective RT-PCR kits, the lack of specific equipment required to perform this technique in all clinical laboratories limits its widespread use. In the case of COVID-19, these tests can be used for the triage of symptomatic patients, for testing the contacts of confirmed cases, and also for the analysis and monitoring of the situation. Along with molecular tests involving reverse transcription PCR, various laboratory tests can identify the specific anti-viral antibodies or viral antigens. This review seeks to describe the targets and diagnostic methods available or currently in development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), serologic immunoassays (SIA) and the protein microarray method (PMM). Knowing the specific targets and the sensitivity of each assay used for COVID-19 diagnosis can lead to more efficient detection of infected patients and it can provide better management of the pandemic status.	false
0	COVID-19 Viral Pneumonia Complicated with Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Descriptive Study. Objective: To evaluate acute pulmonary embolism in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia using pulmonary CT angiography. Subjects and Methods. From 95 symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR from 1 May to 14 July 2020 in Dallah Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, CT angiography was done for 25 patients suspected to have pulmonary embolism and have no contraindication for contrast study. 11 cases of them showed CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Retrospectively, CT angiography was analyzed and detailed findings were recorded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital, and the patient consent was waived., Results: The mean age of the included patients was 49 +/- 11 years; the youngest was 22 years, and the oldest was 64 years. Common symptoms in the 25 cases that underwent CT angiography were fever that was noted in 21/25 cases (84%), shortness of breath in 18/25 cases (72%), cough in 16/25 cases (64%), and severe myalgia/body fatigue in 13/25 cases (52%). The less common symptoms were sore throat in 11/25 cases (44%) and headache in 10/25 cases (40%). Regarding CT findings, 4/25 cases (16%) had unilateral lung disease and 21/25 cases (84%) had bilateral disease, with slight predilection for the right lower lobe (10/25 cases, 40%). Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was seen in 13/25 cases (52%), and GGO with consolidation was seen in 12/25 cases (48%). Common accompanying CT signs included crazy paving stone sign in 15/25 cases (60%) and air bronchogram in 12/25 cases (48%). From the 25 patients that showed respiratory deterioration and elevated serum D-dimer level, 11 cases confirmed to have acute pulmonary embolism, while 14 cases showed negative result for pulmonary embolism. 6/11 were male and 5/11 were female. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at a mean of 21 days from symptom onset. Unilateral acute pulmonary embolism was seen in 3/11 cases, while 8/11 cases showed bilateral distribution. Among 11 cases with acute pulmonary embolism, no emboli at the central level could be seen, but 3 cases showed pulmonary embolism at the lobar level, 3 cases at the segmental level, and 5 cases at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental levels., Conclusion: In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we should maintain a high suspicion for its thromboembolic complications such as acute pulmonary embolism that was mainly diagnosed at the end of 3rd week from symptom onset. We suggest that whenever a CT evaluation of the parenchymal involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia is performed, a simultaneous evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is also essential in order to identify early signs of associated pulmonary embolism.

0	Potential mechanisms of cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 patients. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2019, it is gaining worldwide attention at the moment. Apart from respiratory manifestations, neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, especially the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), has been intensively investigated. In this review, the effects of COVID-19 infection on CVD were summarized as follows: (I) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the attack on vascular endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to endothelial damage and increased subintimal inflammation, which are followed by hemorrhage or thrombosis; (II) SARS-CoV-2 could alter the expression/activity of ACE2, consequently resulting in the disruption of renin-angiotensin system which is associated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis; (III) upregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been detected in COVID-19 patients, which is closely associated with immunothrombosis; (IV) the inflammatory cascade induced by SARS-CoV-2 often leads to hypercoagulability and promotes the formation and progress of atherosclerosis; (V) antiphospholipid antibodies are also detected in plasma of some severe cases, which aggravate the thrombosis through the formation of immune complexes; (VI) hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients may trigger CVD by increasing oxidative stress and blood viscosity; (VII) the COVID-19 outbreak is a global emergency and causes psychological stress, which could be a potential risk factor of CVD as coagulation, and fibrinolysis may be affected. In this review, we aimed to further our understanding of CVD-associated COVID-19 infection, which could improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients. Personalized treatments should be offered to COVID-19 patients at greater risk for stroke in future clinical practice.	false
0	The surge of dengue cases during COVID-19 in Indonesia. Most healthcare resources in Indonesia have been engulfed by COVID-19 pandemic, and less attention has been given to the rising cases of dengue that has been endemic in many areas of Indonesia. Present study aimed to review the immunopathogenesis of dengue and COVID-19 infection, as well as their prevention strategies. This study is a narrative review based on the research articles and reports published between 2010-2020. A total of 60 articles and reports were obtained and after careful consideration 49 articles and reports were used as references of this study. The immune response in Dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections aims to eliminate the virus, but it causes an increase in inflammatory mediators (cytokine storm) which can increase vascular permeability and organ damage. Secondary infection of Dengue virus with different strains may allow the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement. The possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been studied in vitro and in animal studies. Dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections have antigenic similarities and trigger memory B cells. The cross reactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies and Dengue virus antigens may cause false positive on rapid dengue infection serological tests. The prevention and control of Dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections are based on the transmission mode, and people should comply to the related health protocols.Copyright © 2020, Yerevan State Medical University.

0	The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on liver injury in China: A systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: The evidence for the incidence and severity of liver injury in Chinese patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China., METHODS: Computer searches of PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350)., RESULTS: A total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77-2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspertate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and the lower the level of albumin (ALB)., CONCLUSION: There is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.

0	BCG immunomodulation: From the 'hygiene hypothesis' to COVID-19. The century-old tuberculosis vaccine BCG has been the focus of renewed interest due to its well-documented ability to protect against various non-TB pathogens. Much of these broad spectrum protective effects are attributed to trained immunity, the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells. As BCG vaccine is safe, cheap, widely available, amendable to use as a recombinant vector, and immunogenic, it has immense potential for use as an immunotherapeutic agent for various conditions including autoimmune, allergic, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases as well as a preventive measure against infectious agents. Of particular interest is the use of BCG vaccination to counteract the increasing prevalence of autoimmune and allergic conditions in industrialized countries attributable to reduced infectious burden as described by the 'hygiene hypothesis.' Furthermore, BCG vaccination has been proposed as a potential therapy to mitigate spread and disease burden of COVID-19 as a bridge to development of a specific vaccine and recombinant BCG expression vectors may prove useful for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antigens (rBCG-SARS-CoV-2) to induce long-term immunity. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of BCG vaccine in these disease contexts is therefore critical. To that end, we review here BCG-induced immunomodulation focusing specifically on BCG-induced trained immunity and how it relates to the 'hygiene hypothesis' and COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier GmbH	false
0	A systematic review and meta-analysis of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients. A meta-analysis was carried out to identify studies on COVID-19 from 25 December 2019 to 30 April 2020. A total of 48 studies with 5829 pediatric patients were included. Children of all ages were at risk for COVID-19. The main illness classification ranged as: 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-26%; I2 = 91.4%) asymptomatic, 33% (95% CI: 23%-43%; I2 = 95.6%) mild and 51% (95% CI: 42%-61%; I2 = 93.4%) moderate. The typical clinical manifestations were fever 51% (95% CI: 45%-57%; I2 = 78.9%) and cough 41% (95% CI: 35%-47%, I2 = 81.0%). The common laboratory findings were normal white blood cell 69% (95% CI: 64%-75%; I2 = 58.5%), lymphopenia 16% (95% CI: 11%-21%; I2 = 76.9%) and elevated creatine-kinase MB 37% (95% CI: 25%-48%; I2 = 59.0%). The frequent imaging features were normal images 41% (95% CI: 30%-52%; I2 = 93.4%) and ground-glass opacity 36% (95% CI: 25%-47%; I2 = 92.9%). Among children under 1 year old, critical cases account for 14% (95% CI: 13%-34%; I2 = 37.3%) that should be of concern. In addition, vomiting occurred in 33% (95% CI: 18%-67%; I2 = 0.0%) cases that may also need attention. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 may experience milder illness with atypical clinical manifestations and rare lymphopenia. High incidence of critical illness and vomiting symptoms reward attention in children under 1 year old.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

This has led to a growing interest in disaster medicine. In this review, we report current evidence related to disasters and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as cardiovascular diseases during disasters, management of disaster hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19. This review summarizes the time course and mechanisms of disaster-related diseases. It also discusses the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as a cardiovascular risk management strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. During the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, we used the ""Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention"" system that was employed for blood pressure (BP) monitoring and risk management using ICT. We introduced an ICT-based BP monitoring device at evacuation centers and shared patients' BP values in the database to support BP management by remote monitoring, which led to improved BP control. Effective use of telemedicine using ICT is important for risk management of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics in the future.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Potential immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D in the prevention of severe coronavirus disease 2019: An ally for Latin America (Review). Currently, the world is under a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is characterized by a respiratory syndrome that can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. To date, limited effective therapies are available for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19; therefore, it is necessary to propose novel treatment options with immunomodulatory effects. Vitamin D serves functions in bone health and has been recently reported to exert protective effects against respiratory infections. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and a poor prognosis of COVID-19; this is alarming as vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. In Latin America, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is unknown, and currently, this region is in the top 10 according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Supplementation with vitamin D may be a useful adjunctive treatment for the prevention of COVID-19 complications. The present review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the potential immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D in the prevention of COVID-19 and sets out vitamin D recommendations for the Latin American population.	false
0	COVID-19, Racial Discrimination, and Psychological Distress. Purpose: We aim to assess the prevalence of racial discrimination against Chinese immigrants, examine the likelihood of experiencing discrimination across social groups, and investigate the relationship between racial discrimination and psychological distress in the context of COVID-19. Method(s): We used data from a cross-sectional non-random online survey in April 2020 in Canada, with Chinese immigrants aged 16 or older recruited through social media and internet. Respondents with complete information, including sociodemographic, discrimination, and psychological distress variables, were included in the analysis (n = 467). We reported the overall rate of self-reported discrimination and used logistic regression analysis to examine the likelihood of experience with discrimination across social groups (age, gender, language, education, income, occupation, years living in Canada). We used ordinal logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between discrimination and psychological distress, as indexed by self-reported anxiety, depression, distress, unease, fear, indecisiveness, and confusion. Result(s): Overall, 11.6% of the respondents experienced racial discrimination. Nevertheless, there were no statistically significant differences in the likelihood of experiencing discrimination across social groups. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, those who experienced discrimination were more likely to report higher level of self-perceived anxiety (OR = 2.26; 95%-CI = 1.30-3.91), depression (OR = 1.90; 95%-CI = 1.09-3.30), distress (OR = 2.89, 95%-CI = 1.63-5.15), unease (OR = 2.25; 95%-CI = 1.27-3.97), fear (OR = 2.24; 95%-CI = 1.35-4.03), indecisiveness (OR = 2.16; 95%-CI = 1.25-3.73), and confusion (OR = 2.66; 95%-CI = 1.52-4.65). Conclusion(s): Our study documents the highly visible discrimination experienced by Chinese immigrants irrespective of social background, and the resulting discrimination-associated psychological distress in a time of crisis.

Background: With the increasing impact of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in sub-Saharan Africa, the global health community has recognized that EVD survivors are at high risk for uveitis, an ocular inflammatory condition that may lead to vision loss. These findings have immediate relevance, particularly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has heightened our awareness of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Key Findings and Results: A range of infectious diseases including Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19 may show ophthalmic manifestations, which may be associated with ocular viral RNA presence.1 We previously cared for a U.S. health care worker and EVD survivor who developed a severe, sight-threatening panuveitis during EVD convalescence, which was associated with ocular Ebola virus persistence.2 Our evaluation of EVD survivors in Liberia led to the identification of uveitis in over 20% of EVD survivors, with vision impairment in 60% of eyes.3 The subsequent EVICT Study in Sierra Leone was performed to determine the prevalence of Ebola virus within the ocular fluid of patients needing cataract surgery. Our study results showed negative EBOV ocular fluid results by RT-PCR in 50 patients at a median of 18-34 following acute EVD. Patients who underwent cataract surgery showed vision restoration, improving from hand motions to 20/30 at three-months (P<0.001).4 Infrastructural support, training and rapid response teams are opportunities to prepare health systems for future EVD and EID outbreaks.1 Conclusion(s): Ebola and EIDs have demonstrated the importance of understanding ocular complications. Vision health systems preparedness will be particularly relevant as data emerges from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. References: 1. Bavinger JC, Shantha JG, Yeh S.

0	Dysphagia and evolution during COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients. A multidisciplinary challenge for healthcare workers. Introduction: Critically ill patients have an increased risk of dysphagia after prolonged oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) [1, 2]. COVID-19 is a multisystem disease caused by SARS-COV-2, characterized by acute respiratory failure; severe forms usually need mechanical ventilation (MV) support and required OTI; for prolonged courses tracheostomy is mandatory [3, 4]. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate dysphagia in critically ill COVID-19 patients, analyzing relations with clinical and biological data concerning MV during the ICU stay. Moreover, an analysis about recovery rate from dysphagia and its characteristics were reported. Method(s): This was a retrospective study on COVID-19 cohort patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU); patients died before the first evaluation were excluded from the analysis. Dysphagia score has been reported in agreement with Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) [5]. GUSS stratified the severity of dysphagia into severe (0-9), moderate (10-14), mild (15-19) or no dysphagia (20 points), according to clinical evaluation made by speech and language therapist (SLT). Data related to MV days, ICU length of stay (LOS) and other clinically relevant variables were analyzed. Result(s): Forty-two consecutive patients were admitted to ICU, with an average age of 61 years (SD 12); according to exclusion criteria, 31 (74%) were evaluated by the nurse and the SLT. Twenty-five of them were mechanically ventilated; 19 (76%) patients were treated with OTI, and 6 (24%) of them were tracheostomized; median MV days were 11 (7.5 - 16). At first SLT evaluation, 14 (45.2%) patients showed no dysphagia, 5 (16.1%) a mild degree of dysphagia, 6 (19.4%) a moderate level of dysphagia and 6 (19.4%) patients had a severe dysphagia. Mean first GUSS evaluation was 15.1 (SD 6.5), with a median of 19 (IQR = 12-20). A correlation was found between distribution of GUSS score at first evaluation and ICU LOS (p < 0.001), MV days (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.03) and tracheostomy (p = 0.04). No correlation was found with BMI, SAPS, SOFA, NEMS at admission, sex, comorbidities (COPD, OSA, diabetes, Hypertension and IHD), pronation maneuvers and initial PEEP setting. After 7 days from the first SLT evaluation, GUSS stratification showed 2 (6.5%) patients with severe form of dysphagia, 2 (6.5%) with moderate dysphagia, 4 (12.9%) with mild dysphagia and finally 23 (74.2%) without dysphagia. This 7-days evolution resulted significantly different from baseline (p < 0.001). Severe, moderate, mild and none dysphagia significantly evolved on day 14 (p = 0.01) with a prevalence of 0%, 3.2%, 9.7%, 87.1% respectively. Intriguingly, severe forms of dysphagia were no longer found at 12 days. Conclusion(s): In COVID-19 patients, dysphagia disorders were related to the length of the MV, to ICU LOS and to tracheostomy placement. The GUSS temporal evolution could suggest that a multidisciplinary synergic approach to dysphagia management, which consist of a nurse and a SLT, would seems to improve the outcome of this symptom in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Futures analysis are necessary to confirm the hypothesis that the SLT treatment could have a positive predictive role in dysphagia recovery.	false
0	Drivers of Acceptance of COVID-19 Proximity Tracing Apps in Switzerland: Panel Survey Analysis. BACKGROUND: Digital proximity tracing apps have been released to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how the acceptance and uptake of these apps can be improved. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to investigate the coverage of the SwissCovid app and the reasons for its nonuse in Switzerland during a period of increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHOD(S): We collected data between September 28 and October 8, 2020, via a nationwide online panel survey (COVID-19 Social Monitor, N=1511). We examined sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with app use by using multivariable logistic regression, whereas reasons for app nonuse were analyzed descriptively. RESULT(S): Overall, 46.5% (703/1511) of the survey participants reported they used the SwissCovid app, which was an increase from 43.9% (662/1508) reported in the previous study wave conducted in July 2020. A higher monthly household income (ie, income >CHF 10,000 or >US $11,000 vs income <=CHF 6000 or <US $6600 [reference]: odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.64), more frequent internet use (ie, daily [reference] vs less than weekly: OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85), better adherence to recommendations for wearing masks (ie, always or most of the time [reference] vs rarely or never: OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and nonsmoker status (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (ie, non-Swiss citizenship vs. Swiss [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87), and language region (French vs Swiss German [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80) were associated with a lower likelihood for app uptake. Further analysis in a randomly selected subsample (n=712) with more detailed information showed that higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were also associated with a higher likelihood for app uptake (ie, high vs low [reference] trust: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.58-6.22). The most frequent reasons for app nonuse were lack of perceived benefit of using the app (297/808, 36.8%), followed by the lack of a compatible phone (184/808, 22.8%), and privacy concerns (181/808, 22.4%). CONCLUSION(S): Eliminating technical hurdles and communicating the benefits of digital proximity tracing apps are crucial to promote further uptake and adherence of such apps and, ultimately, enhance their effectiveness to aid pandemic mitigation strategies.Copyright ©Viktor von Wyl, Marc Hoglinger, Chloe Sieber, Marco Kaufmann, Andre Moser, Miquel Serra-Burriel, Tala Ballouz, Dominik Menges, Anja Frei, Milo Alan Puhan.

0	Associations of Medications With Lower Odds of Typical COVID-19 Symptoms: Cross-Sectional Symptom Surveillance Study. BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the globe, the search for an effective medication to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 continues as well. It would be desirable to identify a medication that is already in use for another condition and whose side effect profile and safety data are already known and approved. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different medications on typical COVID-19 symptoms by using data from an online surveillance survey. METHOD(S): Between early April and late-July 2020, a total of 3654 individuals in Lower Saxony, Germany, participated in an online symptom-tracking survey conducted through the app covid-nein-danke.de. The questionnaire comprised items on typical COVID-19 symptoms, age range, gender, employment in patient-facing healthcare, housing status, postal code, previous illnesses, permanent medication, vaccination status, results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antibody tests for COVID-19 diagnosis, and consequent COVID-19 treatment if applicable. Odds ratio estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were computed for each medication and symptom by using logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Data analysis suggested a statistically significant inverse relationship between typical COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by the participants and self-reported statin therapy and, to a lesser extent, antihypertensive therapy. When COVID-19 diagnosis was based on restrictive symptom criteria (ie, presence of 4 out of 7 symptoms) or a positive RT-PCR test, a statistically significant association was found solely for statins (odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.1-0.78). CONCLUSION(S): Individuals taking statin medication are more likely to have asymptomatic COVID-19, in which case they may be at an increased risk of transmitting the disease unknowingly. We suggest that the results of this study be incorporated into symptoms-based surveillance and decision-making protocols in regard to COVID-19 management. Whether statin therapy has a beneficial effect in combating COVID-19 cannot be deduced based on our findings and should be investigated by further study.

0	Passing the Test: A model-based analysis of safe school-reopening strategies. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has induced historic educational disruptions. In December 2020, at least two-thirds of US public school students were not attending full-time in-person education. The Biden Administration has expressed that reopening schools is a priority., OBJECTIVE: To compare risks of SARS-COV-2 transmission in schools across different school-based prevention strategies and levels of community transmission., DESIGN: We developed an agent-based network model to simulate transmission in elementary and high school communities, including home, school, and inter-household interactions., SETTING: We parameterized school structure based on average US classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1,451 students. We varied daily community incidence from 1 to 100 cases per 100,000 population. Patients (or Participants). We simulated students, faculty/staff, and adult household members., INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual's contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening., MEASUREMENTS: We projected transmission among students, staff and families during one month following introduction of a single infection into a school. We also calculated the number of infections expected for a typical 8-week quarter, contingent on community incidence rate., RESULTS: School transmission risk varies according to student age and community incidence and is substantially reduced with effective, consistent mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular, frequent testing due to the subclinical nature of most infections in children. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, while asymptomatic screening both improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission, facilitating five-day schedules at full classroom capacity., LIMITATIONS: There is uncertainty about susceptibility and infectiousness of children and low precision regarding the effectiveness of specific prevention measures, particularly with emergence of new variants., CONCLUSION: With controlled community transmission and moderate school-based prevention measures, elementary schools can open with few in-school transmissions, while high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening can both reduce transmission and provide useful information for decision-makers.	false
0	Transitional pain clinic. Persistent postoperative pain is pain that develops after a surgical procedure, which the patient did not present before surgery. It is becoming more and more frequent and a prevalence ranging between 10 % and 50 % of adult patients undergoing major surgery is reported. It should be considered an important public health problem not only because of the anguish and disability it produces, but it may have contributed to the opioid epidemic in the 1980s, and part of the tools used for its treatment may have contributed to this crisis in the United States, by promoting the long-term use of opioids in patients with non-cancer pain. In order to reduce the severity of postoperative acute pain, a fundamental risk factor involved in the origin of PPP, multidisciplinary approaches are required, aimed at preventing and treating the different risk factors that anticipate this disease. This is how the Transitional Pain Service or Transitional Pain Clinic appears in 2014. It is a novel program that aims to effectively control of acute postoperative acute pain, facilitate opioid weaning, reduce the development of chronic pain disability, and help decrease deaths related to opioid over prescription. This model of care was created to effectively manage patients' perioperative pain, maintain function, reduce opioid use, and monitor the efficacy of these interventions. It focuses on persistent postoperative pain in three stages: 1) pre-operative, 2) post-operative in the hospital setting, 3) post-operative in the outpatient setting up to 6 months after surgery. This program offers services focused on: 1) Introduction and optimization of multimodal analgesia, to improve pain management and facilitate weaning from opioids; 2) Non-pharmacological interventions including physical therapy and acupuncture; and 3) Psychological interventions by a trained pain psychology team, around an acceptance and commitment therapy model. The new situation we are experiencing with COVID-19 demands innovations in medical care, as non-urgent medical care is reduced or abolished and it is time to look for different options from conventional ones for patient follow-up, it is the time of Telehealth. For now, it is necessary to leverage Video Tele Heath and Transitional Pain Service to continue monitoring our patients.Copyright © 2020 Ediciones Doyma, S.L.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Are anosmia or headaches in critically ill COVID-19 patients an early indicator of neurological complications?. Introduction: On the frontline of the battle against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) the importance of identifying symptoms early and understanding their clinical relevance is crucial. Up to 36% of Covid 19 patients exhibit some form of neurological symptoms, such as anosmia and headaches on presentation (1, 2). However, it is not known whether patients presenting with neurological symptoms are at higher risk of neurological complications in an intensive care unit (ICU). Objective(s): This study aims to assess whether critically ill patients presenting with neurological symptoms are at higher risk of subsequent neurological sequelae in critically ill patients infected with Covid-19. Method(s): This is a retrospective observational study of PCR positive Covid-19 patients admitted to ICU in a single tertiary hospital. Anosmia and headache were considered neurological symptoms at presentation (3). Neurological complications, including stroke and intracranial bleeding, were diagnosed using a combination of clinical evidence and consultant level neuroradiology review of computer tomography (CT) imaging (4). Chi-square statistic with risk estimation was used to assess association between categorical variables. P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. Result(s): 132 patients were included in the study. 14 (10.6%) presented with headache and 11 (8.3%) with anosmia. In terms of complications, 21(15.9%) had a intracranial haemorrhage, and 3 (2.3%) also had a stroke. Among 21 patients who had neurological complications in ICU, 3 patients presented with headache (21.4%) and 2 patients had anosmia on presentation (18.2%). These associations are neither significant for headache (p = 0.55, OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.4, 6.0) nor for anosmia (p= 0.83). Conclusion(s): Anosmia or headache at presentation is not associated with higher incidence of neurological complications in critically ill patients infected with Covid-19.	false
0	Imaging of children with COVID-19: experience from a tertiary children's hospital in the United States. Background: Imaging of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described in adults, but children have milder forms of disease. Pediatric imaging descriptions are of asymptomatic children, raising the question of whether imaging is needed in this patient group. Objective(s): To describe the utilization and imaging findings in children with COVID-19 along with the comorbidities, treatment and short-term outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19 during a 2-month period. We noted symptoms and presence of imaging at presentation. Comorbidities were recorded for children with imaging. Children were categorized as having multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) if they met criteria for the disorder. For children who were admitted to the hospital, we documented length of hospital stay, need for intensive care unit care/ventilator support, and treatment regimen. We evaluated all imaging for acute/chronic abnormalities including chest radiographs for interstitial or alveolar opacities, distribution/symmetry of disease, zonal predominance, and pleural abnormalities. We performed descriptive statistics and compared children with MIS-C with the cohort using a Fisher exact test. Result(s): During the study period, 5,969 children were tested for COVID-19, with 313 (5%) testing positive. Of these, 92/313 (29%) were asymptomatic and 55/313 (18%) had imaging and were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Forty-one of 55 patients (75%) with imaging had comorbidities. Chest radiographs were the most common examination (51/55 patients, or 93%) with most demonstrating no abnormality (34/51, or 67%). Children with MIS-C were more likely to have interstitial opacities and pleural effusions. US, CT or MRI was performed in 23/55 (42%) children, 9 of whom had MIS-C. Only one chest CT was performed. Conclusion(s): In our study, most pediatric patients with COVID-19 did not require hospital admission or imaging. Most children with imaging had comorbidities but children with MIS-C were more likely to have no comorbidities. Children with imaging mostly had normal chest radiography. Advanced imaging (US, CT, MRI) was less common for the care of these children, particularly CT examination of the chest and for children without MIS-C.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Public in Egypt. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public in Egypt during the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An online snowball sampling approach was used to collect data from netizens in four Egyptian governorates between 16 and 30 April 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to assess sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping hours per day, and psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, and stress) of participants using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Out of 1629 participants, 48.1% were aged <=30 years, 42.4% were men, and 20.0% were working in the health sector. The participants reported a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping (<6 h/day) 23.1%. Female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news >=2 h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress. In conclusion, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on the public in Egypt were enormous, therefore, providing psychological support and counsel is warranted.	false
0	"Pneumolysis and ""Silent Hypoxemia"" in COVID-19. COVID-19 can evolve to a severe lung compromise with life-threatening hypoxemia. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Their understanding is crucial to improve the outcomes. Initially, past-experience lead to the implementation of standardized protocols assuming this disease would be the same as SARS-CoV. Impulsive use of ventilators in extreme cases ended up in up to 88% fatality. We compare medical and physiological high altitude acute and chronic hypoxia experience with COVID-19 hypoxemia. A pathophysiological analysis is performed based on literature review and histopathological findings. Application of the Tolerance to Hypoxia formula = Hemoglobin/PaCO2 + 3.01 to COVID-19, enlightens its critical hypoxemia. Pneumolysis is defined as progressive alveolar-capillary destruction resulting from the CoV-2 attack to pneumocytes. The adequate interpretation of the histopathological lung biopsy photomicrographs reveals these alterations. The three theoretical pathophysiological stages of progressive hypoxemia (silent hypoxemia, gasping, and death zone) are described. At high altitude, normal low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels (with intact lung tissue and adequate acid-base status) could be considered silent hypoxemia. At sea level, in COVID-19, the silent hypoxemia starting at SpO2 <= 90% (comparable to a normal SPO2 {88-92%} at 3500 m) suddenly evolves to critical hypoxemia. This, as a consequence of progressive pneumolysis + inflammation + overexpressed immunity + HAPE-type edema resulting in pulmonary shunting. The proposed treatment is based on the improvement of the Tolerance to Hypoxia (Hemoglobin factor), oxygen therapy, inflammation reduction, antibiotics, antitussives, rehydration & anticoagulation if required. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 may assist in this disease's management.Copyright © 2020, Association of Clinical Biochemists of India."	false
0	"The role of air conditioning in the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 in indoor environments: A first computational fluid dynamic model, based on investigations performed at the Vatican State Children's hospital. Background: About 15 million people worldwide were affected by the Sars-Cov-2 infection, which already caused 600,000 deaths. This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. Method(s): We modeled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the ""Bambino Gesu"" Vatican State Children's Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (eta) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient's mouth was also assessed. Result(s): Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 s from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient's mouth in the first 0.5 s following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the eta index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. Conclusion(s): CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc."	false
0	Study on transmission dynamic of 15 clusters of COVID-2019 cases in Ningbo. Objective: To describe the basic characteristics of clusters of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, and evaluate the generation time (Tg) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19. Method(s): The basic information and onset times of the clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo were investigated, the inter-generational interval of the cases were fitted by using gamma distribution, and the R(0) was calculated based on the SEIR model. Result(s): In the 15 clusters of COVID-19 cases, a total of 52 confirmed cases, 5 cases of nucleic acid-positive asymptomatic cases. The cases occurred from January 23 to February 4, the cases were mainly women. The incubation period was (6.11+/-3.38) days, and the median was 5 days. The Tg was (6.93+/-3.70) days. There were no significant differences in Tg between age group<60 years and age group 60 years and above, and between men and women (P=0.551). According to the Tg calculated in this paper, the R(0) of COVID-19 in Ningbo was 3.06 (95%CI: 2.64- 3.51); according to the reported case transmission interval of 7.5 days in the literature, the R(0) was 3.32 (95%CI: 2.51-9.38). Conclusion(s): There is no age and gender specific differences in the Tg of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo, and COVID-19 has high infectivity and spreading power in early phase.	false
0	E-predeliric and predeliric as predictors of delirium in patients admitted for SARS COV-2 infection. Which scale is closer to reality?. Introduction: The incidence of delirium in patients admitted to ICU due to SARS COV-2 infection is very high according to the different registers. The use of validated scores such as Predeliric and E-predeliric that predict the likelihood of delirium development in different patients can help in setting priorities with regard to the use of delirium preventive measures, especially in situations of limited resources such as COVID infection. Objective(s): 1.Evaluate the correlation between the E-Predeliric and Predeliric values when they are recoded into four categories of risk of developing delirium (very low, low, moderate and high risk). 2.Evaluate the correlation between the predicted probability of delirium according to the E-Predeliric and Predeliric models with the actual rate of delirium developed in patients admitted to the ICU for SARS COV 2. Method(s): Retrospective observational study carried out in a multipurpose ICU with 30 beds. All patients admitted for SARS COV2 infection were collected during the months of March to May 2020. The E-PREDELIRIC was calculated in all patients at the time of ICU admission and the PRE-DELIRICa24 hours after admission, classifying patients into four risk groups according to the result (very low, low, moderate and high risk). We quantified the incidence of delirium after sedation was removed. The presence of agitation, maladjustment (in the absence of pain or ventilatory problems) and the need for administration of dexmedetomidine or an antipsychotic drug was considered delirium. And finally the results were compared with the actual rate of delirium observed in these patients. Result(s): During the period from March to May 2020, a total of 27 patients were admitted to our service with the diagnosis of SARSCOV 2, with an average age of 65.81 +/- 9.72. There is a high correlation between the percentage values of E-Predeliric and Predeliric (r = 0.608, p = 0.01). This result is corroborated with the association test between both variables when they are recoded in four categories. There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage value of E-Predeliric and the patient's state of real delirium (t = 1,481, p = 0.151). Their mean values are very similar (38.95% and 33.50% for the patients who suffered delirium versus those who did not, respectively). The opposite occurs with Predeliric (t = 5,460, p = 0.00), with the mean values being 85.68% and 41.00%. These results are corroborated with the association test performed between the patient's actual state of delirium and these two scales coded in its four states. Conclusion(s): 1.The E-Predeliric and Predeliricscores allow patients to be classified according to the risk of developing delirium in 4 groups, in a homogeneous manner, regardless of the score used. 2.The predicted risk at admission according to the E-Predeliric, in relation to the observed delirium rate, shows that the risk of delirium is underestimated, while the24h after admission calculatedPredeliric is better correlated with the actual incidence observed.	false
0	COVID-19 among the inhabitants of the slums in the city of Buenos Aires: A population-based study. Objective To summarise the unfolding of the COVID-19 epidemic among slum dwellers and different social strata in the city of Buenos Aires during the first 20 weeks after the first reported case. Design Observational study using a time-series analysis. Natural experiment in a big city. Setting Population of the city of Buenos Aires and the integrated health reporting system records of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 tests. Participants Records from the Argentine Integrated Health Reporting System for all persons with suspected and RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 31 January and 14 July 2020. Outcomes To estimate the effects of living in a slum on the standardised incidence rate of COVID-19, corrected Poisson regression models were used. Additionally, the impact of socioeconomic status was performed using an ecological analysis at the community level. Results A total of 114 052 people were tested for symptoms related with COVID-19. Of these, 39 039 (34.2%) were RT-PCR positive. The incidence rates for COVID-19 towards the end of the 20th week were 160 (155 to 165) per 100 000 people among the inhabitants who did not reside in the slums (n=2 841 997) and 708 (674 to 642) among slums dwellers (n=233 749). Compared with the better-off socioeconomic quintile (1.00), there was a linear gradient on incidence rates: 1.36 (1.25 to 1.46), 1.61 (1.49 to 1.74), 1.86 (1.72 to 2.01), 2.94 (2.74 to 3.16) from Q2 to Q5, respectively. Slum dwellers were associated with an incidence rate of 14.3 (13.4 to 15.4). Conclusions The distribution of the epidemic is socially conditioned. Slum dwellers are at a much higher risk than the rest of the community. Slum dwellers should not be considered just another risk category but an entirely different reality that requires policies tailored to their needs. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	Antibodies at work in the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In view of devastating effects of COVID-19 on human life, there is an urgent need for the licened vaccines or therapeutics for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy	false
0	Can the SARS-CoV-2 infection trigger systemic lupus erythematosus? A case-based review. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune and multisystemic chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including skin, joints, kidneys, lungs and the nervous system. Infectious agents have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. The new viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown that, in genetically predisposed patients could trigger the presentation or exacerbation of the autoimmune disease. We herein report a case of a 45-year-old man who presented respiratory symptoms, bilateral pleural effusion, ascites, splenomegaly, severe thrombocytopenia and renal failure with proteinuria and hematuria. SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed the COVID-19 diagnosis. We diagnosed the patient with SLE based on the clinical manifestations and positive immunological markers (2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology, score of 18). Glucocorticoid pulses were administered to the patient, which improved renal function. However, thrombocytopenia was also refractory to IV immunoglobulin and rituximab, so the patient underwent splenectomy. Through a systematic search of the medical literature, we retrieved two cases with newly onset SLE and five cases with previous SLE diagnosis that showed activity of the disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We herein present a systemic review of these cases and discuss the clinical manifestations that could help to the diagnosis of this clinical condition.	false
0	Prevalence of Comorbid Asthma and Related Outcomes in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: The impact of asthma on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. Objective(s): To investigate the asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 and compare outcomes between patients with and without asthma. Method(s): In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for studies reporting asthma prevalence in general patients with COVID-19 or comparing outcomes between patients with and without asthma, and excluded duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, comments, single case reports, or small case series (<10 cases). We determined the pooled estimates of effect using random-effect model. Result(s): On the basis of 131 studies (410,382 patients), we found great variability in the prevalence of comorbid asthma among patients with COVID-19 in different countries or regions ranging from 1.1% to 16.9%. No significant difference in asthma prevalence was found between hospitalized and nonhospitalized (risk ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92-1.43), severe and nonsevere (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.57), intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92-1.54), dead and survived (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.11), intubated/mechanically ventilated and nonintubated/mechanically ventilated (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17) patients with COVID-19. Patients with asthma have a lower risk of death compared with patients without asthma (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.98). Asthma is not associated with a higher risk of intubation or mechanical ventilation (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.72-1.46). Conclusion(s): There is great variability in asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 in different countries or regions. Asthma is not associated with higher COVID-19 severity or worse prognosis, and patients with asthma are found to have a lower risk of death compared with patients without asthma.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology	false
0	PIN82 The Influence of Social Distancing on COVID-19 Infections in the U.S. Objectives: The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus into human populations has resulted in notable changes to behavior in order to mitigate infection risk. Social distancing is one tool that has been implemented. The relationship between social distancing and number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections, controlling for testing numbers, has not been exhaustively researched. We explore the role of social distancing on reported SARS-CoV-2 infections reported for U.S. counties. Method(s): Using U.S. county-level data, we evaluate the impact of social distancing using 1-9 week lags relative to the outcome, new SARS-CoV-2 infections reported. Both distancing and the new infections are measured daily from April 20 - June 28, 2020. Social distancing is calculated from cell phone location data available through Unacast (www.unacast.com) consisting of interpersonal encounters, distance traveled, and non-essential venue visits compared to pre-COVID-19; social distancing score were categorized in the study as: <2 (reference), 2-2.9 (lower), 3-3.9 (medium) and 4-5 (high). We used multivariable Poisson regression models with county population size as an offset adjusting for population density and test numbers per state. Robust standard errors clustered by state are used. Result(s): Nine models were evaluated, varying the time from social distancing to new infections by 1-9 weeks. Counties in the highest distancing score category had 66% lower numbers of reported infections (Incidence Proportion Ratio (IPR)=0.34 (0.22, 0.55)) with 1 week, controlling for number of tests and population density. The protective effect of social distancing did not vary much with time lag. Counties in the second-highest tier of social distancing only had lower infection rates with later lags: IPR=1.32 (0.90, 1.94) with 1-week lag vs IPR= 0.61 (0.50,0.74) at 6 week lag. Conclusion(s): The results reinforce the importance of social distancing to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and support the need for models to consider time lags between social distancing and infection numbers.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Cyberbullying perpetration in the COVID-19 era: An application of general strain theory. The world is currently grappling with the medical, psychological, economic, and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The existing research has rightly been focused on the medical contributions - treatment, symptoms, prevalence, etc. - which are paramount. A paucity of research has tested the psychological and behavioral consequences of COVID-19. In two cross-sectional studies of US adults, we posited that personal (e.g., being diagnosed with COVID-19) and proximal (e.g., knowing people with COVID-19) experiences with COVID-19 would be related to cyberbullying perpetration due to an increase in stress. Using path modeling, results showed that (a) personal and proximal COVID-19 experiences positively correlated with cyberbullying (Studies 1 and 2) and (b) personal COVID-19 experiences were indirectly related to cyberbullying through stress, but not proximal experiences (Study 2).	false
0	High-Quality Masks Reduce COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in the US. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19., Methods: We created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of individuals wearing masks from 0-100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered 25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas)., Results: Introduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and population-wide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR., Conclusions: Even after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above physical distancing interventions., Highlights: This paper shows the impact of widespread adoption of masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying levels of population adherence, mask efficacy, and timing of mask adoption. The paper's findings help inform messaging to policymakers at the state or local level considering adding or keeping mask mandates, and to communities to promote widespread adoption of high-quality masks.Adoption of masks by at least half of the population can reduce cumulative infections and population deaths by more than 25%, while decreasing peak prevalence by about 50%. Even greater marginal improvements arise with adoption rates above 70%. The benefits of adopting high-quality masks is above that achieved by mobility changes and distancing alone.Rural and suburban areas are at higher relative risk than urban areas, due to less distancing and lower adoption of masks.	false
0	Convalescent plasma for COVID-19: Identification of donors with high levels of neutralising antibodies to SARS-COV-2 in The United Kingdom. Background: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) earlier this year led to the rapid implementation of convalescent plasma trials in many countries including the UK. Systematic reviews from previous epidemics propose convalescent plasma may be an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental and animal models suggest therapeutic efficacy is likely dependent on levels of neutralising antibody present in plasma. Aim(s): We have assessed whether commercial ELISA assay could be used to select the donations containing high levels of neutralising antibodies; scalable assays are crucial for selecting units for convalescent plasma production. We have further determined host factors associated with neutralising antibody levels in order to improve donor selection. Method(s): A total of 436 donations were collected from individuals with a previous laboratory confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by microneutralisation and for spike IgG antibodies by EUROimmun ELISA. ROC analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of EUROimmun assay to identify samples containing high levels of neutralising antibodies. A multivariable Gamma Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the factors associated with antibody titres in a subset of 275 donors with detectable neutralising antibodies. Result(s): Almost all donors with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection developed a measurable antibody response (254/256). 80% of all donors had IgG antibodies detectable in the EUROimmun assay and 76% had neutralising antibodies. Antibody reactivity in EUROimmun assay was strongly predictive of neutralising antibody titre by linear regression (R2 = 0.6556, P < 0.0001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 92% of samples with titres >1:100 with 83% specificity using a sample to cut-off (S/Co) ratio of 6.0. Higher antibody levels were observed in males, in older donors and in those who had been hospitalised. Summary/Conclusions: The provision of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies is important. Robust associations between neutralising antibody titres and reactivity in ELISA-based EUROimmun IgG antibody tests witness their possible utility for large-scale production of such convalescent plasma. Our data identifies characteristics of donors associated with high neutralising antibody titres that could be used for targeted donor recruitment.	false
0	Identification of risk factors for in-hospital death of COVID - 19 pneumonia -- lessions from the early outbreak. Background: To examine the clinical characteristics and identify independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Method(s): A total of 156 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia at the Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 29, 2020, to March 20, 2020, and 20 healthy individuals were enrolled in this single-centered retrospective study. The epidemiological parameters, clinical presentations, underlying diseases, laboratory test results, and disease outcomes were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The median age of all enrolled patients was 66 years. At least one underlying disease was identified in 101 COVID-19 patients, with hypertension being the most common one, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most common symptoms identified upon admission were fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Compared to survival cases, patients who died during hospitalization had higher plasma levels of D-dimer, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate, and lower percentage of lymphocytes (LYM [%]), platelet count and albumin levels. Most enrolled patients received antibiotics and anti-viral treatment. In addition, 60 patients received corticosteroids, and 51 received intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. Forty-four patients received noninvasive ventilation and 19 received invasive ventilation. Respiratory failure was the most frequently observed complication (106 [67.9%]), followed by sepsis (103 [66.0%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (67 [42.9%]), and septic shock (50 [32.1%]). Multivariable regression suggested that advanced age (OR [odds ratio] = 1.098, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.006-1.199, P = 0.037), shorter duration from onset to admission (OR = 0.853, 95% CI: 0.750-0.969, P = 0.015) and elevated lactate level upon admission (OR = 2.689, 95% CI: 1.044-6.926, P = 0.040) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, increased LYM (%) at admission (OR = 0.787, 95% CI: 0.686-0.903, P = 0.001) indicated a better prognosis. Conclusion(s): In this study, we discovered that age, duration from onset to admission, LYM (%), and lactate level upon admission were independent factors that affecting the in-hospital mortality rate.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric COVID-19 and Predictors of PCR Positivity. BACKGROUND: To identify the clinical findings and outcomes of children with COVID-19 and factors predicting RT-PCR positivity. METHOD(S): The data retrospectively analyzed for suspected and confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients between March 20 and May 31, 2020. RESULT(S): There were 404 children, of them, 176 (43.6%) patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 which were less symptomatic on admission (67.6% to 95.6%). Cough (44.9%), fever (38.1%), sore throat (18.5%), and smell-taste loss (12.7%) were the most common symptoms. Confirmed cases had 92.6% identified history of contact with COVID-19. Close contact with COVID-19 positive family members and coughs increased the RT-PCR positivity 23.8 and 5.0 times, respectively; while positivity decreased by 0.4 times if fever was over 38degreeC. Asymptomatic and mild cases were categorized as 'group 1' (n=153), moderate, severe and critical cases as 'group 2' (n=23) in terms of disease severity. Group 2 cases had higher C-reactive protein (40.9% to 15.9%) and procalcitonin (22.7% to 4.9%) levels and had more frequent lymphopenia (45.5% to 13.1%). Out of 23 cases, 19 had abnormal chest x-ray findings; of them, 15 patients underwent chest CTs, and all had abnormal findings. However, 26.0% of them needed respiratory support, and no patient required invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION(S): Children with COVID-19 have milder clinical course and SARS-CoV-2 rarely causes severe disease in children. Contact history with COVID-19 and sore throat are the most important predictors for RT-PCR positivity. Consequently, the role of asymptomatic children in the contamination chain must be fully established and considered for the control of pandemic.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Is acute liver injury more prevalent in critically ill patients with Covid-19 infection and respiratory failure?. Introduction: Several studies have identified abnormal liver function tests (ALFT) during the clinical course of Covid-19. [1, 2] Acute liver injury (ALI) in Covid-19 patients may be caused by direct viral effects, systemic inflammatory response, drug toxicity or haemodynamic factors. There is currently no literature comparing incidences and characteristics of liver dysfunction between critically ill patients with and without Covid-19. Objective(s): To assess whether infection with Covid-19 has any impact on liver function in critically ill patients with respiratory failure who are infected with Covid-19 and is relevance for clinical outcomes. Method(s): This is retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) over 5 months. Laboratory data related to liver pathology and function (Alanine transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time) was collected at day 1, 7 and 14 of admission. ALFT are defined as a rise in ALT/ALP greater than the normal limit, whereas ALI is defined as a rise in ALT/ ALP by >=3 times the upper limit of normal. Any ALFT or ALI cases were classified into hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed liver injury. Categorical data was assessed with chi2 test and odds ratio (OR). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess continuous variables between patients infected with Covid-19 (as confirmed by positive viral PCR swab) and those who were not. P values lower than .05 were considered statistically significant. Result(s): There were 256 admissions into intensive care during the study period. 132 (51.6%) was infected with Covid-19. ALFT was present in 80 (60.6%) of Covid-19 patients; 90% had a hepatocellular pattern, 10% had a mixed pattern and 2% was cholestatic. ALFT was present in 55 (44.4%) non-Covid-19 patients (p = .009, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2, 3.2). ALI was observed in 10.1% of non-Covid patients and 10.7% of Covid patients (p = .87). At day 1 of admission, Covid-19 patients had a median ALT of 44 (28, 78) compared to non-Covid-19 patients with a median of 29 (18, 58; p < .001). At day 7, Covid-19 patients had a median albumin of 17 (14-19) compared to 19.5 (16, 24, p = .01) in non-Covid-19 patients. On day 14, there was no significant differences in distribution of liver biochemistry or prothrombin time between the two cohorts. Within the Covid-19 group, there are no significant differences between patients with or without ALFT or ALI in 28-day mortality, requirement of renal replacement therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation or duration of vasoactive support Conclusion(s): ALFT is more prevalent in Covid-19 patients compared to other patients with respiratory failure, and mainly with a hepatocellular pattern. Covid-19 patients may display poorer liver synthetic function in early stages of the disease (<14 days). There is no impact on clinical outcomes.	false
0	High Prevalence of Hypocalcemia in Non-severe COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Case-Control Study. Purpose: To compare serum total calcium and phosphate levels in patients with non-severe COVID-19 with age, sex, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level matched healthy adult cohort. Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, medical records of patients (>= 18 years) diagnosed as non-severe COVID-19 admitted at and discharged from our tertiary care institution during the period from April 10, 2020 and June 20, 2020 were retrieved. Baseline investigations, notably, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, magnesium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and C-reactive protein (CRP), were performed at admission before any form of calcium or vitamin D supplementation were considered. The biochemical parameters were compared with age, sex, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D matched healthy adult controls (1:1 ratio) derived from the Chandigarh Urban Bone Epidemiological Study (CUBES). Results: After exclusion, 72 patients with non-severe COVID-19 (63 mild and 9 moderate disease) and an equal number of healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Age, sex, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and albumin levels were matched between the 2 groups. Hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia were seen in 97 and 67% of the patients, respectively. The patients had lower serum calcium (P value <0.001) and phosphate (P = 0.007) compared with the controls. There was no statistically significant correlation between serum calcium and CRP. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia is highly prevalent even in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease probably implying that hypocalcemia is intrinsic to the disease. Prospective studies with larger number of patients are required to prove this hypothesis and unravel the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.	false
0	Cladribine is a safe and effective treatment for highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Background: Cladribine is a novel disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that has recently been licensed for the treatment of highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrMS) in Scotland. Lymphocytopaenia (LLC) was reported as the main side-effect of this treatment, in clinical trials. Objective(s): 1. Determining the real-world incidence of adverse effects of cladribine 2. Assessing the temporo-spatial likelihood of adverse effects 3. Commenting on current practice for monitoring and managing adverse incidents. Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of 120 patients prescribed cladribine, over four health boards in Scotland, assessed the incidence of adverse effects at 1 and 2 year intervals, by examination of patient notes, documented self-reported patient comments and follow-up blood monitoring results. Result(s): It is affirmed that LLC is the main adverse effect of cladribine, occurring in around 68% of patients following receipt of the first treatment cycle and 75% following receipt of the second. Mild to moderate LLC (Grades 0-2) was present in 84% of LLC patients within treatment year 1, but only 58% of LLC patients after year 2. The average lag to peak LLC is noted to be two to four months after first treatment (n patients = 75%) and similarly after the second (n = 66%), indicating the optimal time frame for routine follow-up screening. Other adverse effects were noted in 25 patients (21%), most commonly fatigue (incidence = 0.07), hair loss (incidence = 0.05) and nausea (incidence = 0.03). Allergic-type reactions were also observed in 2% of patients, but these were mild and treatable, without interruption to therapy. All patients in this cohort had adequate V. zoster pre-screening and prophylaxis. Treatment continuation was disrupted in 31% of patients due to COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Adequate infection prophylaxis and counselling are noted to be key aspects of preassessment. Treatment is interrupted where no adequate protection can be provided. It is essential to ensure adequate lymphocyte populations, via routine screening and follow-up monitoring, before treatment initiation or progression. Shielding of cladribine patients from COVID-19 or similar may be indicated for up to 6 months after treatment, covering the nadir of LLC.	false
0	Safety and tolerability of cladribine in multiple sclerosis-clinical experience of two tertiary centers. Background: Cladribine is a selective and oral immunological reconstitution treatment, approved in Europe in 2017 and in Portugal in 2018 for very active multiple sclerosis (MS) with relapses. Its safety and efficacy profile were assessed in phase III CLARITY (2005-2009) trial. Post-commercialization studies in real life conditions, are essential to confirm this profile. Objective(s): To assess the safety and tolerability of cladribine in MS patients a real-world clinical setting, during treatment follow-up. Method(s): Observational, multicentric, prospective study. Consecutive MS patients treated with cladribine were included in two tertiary hospitals in Lisbon and followed during treatment. Demographic and clinical aspects, EDSS, previous disease-modifying drugs (DMD) and annual relapse rate (ARR) were recorded, as well as laboratory, imaging monitoring and adverse reactions during treatment. Result(s): Eighty-five included patients, 54 (63.5%) female, mean age 42+/-12 years old, mean disease duration 9+/-7 years. Seventyseven (90.6%) had relapsing-remitting MS, and the remaining had secondary progressive MS. Median pre-treatment EDSS was 2,0 (1,5-4,0). Most (65.9%) patients had been submitted to more than one DMD before, 43 (51.2%) with first-line therapies and 9 (10.7%) were naive. Cladribine was started in 57 (68.7%) patients due to inefficacy of previous drug. Mean follow-up time was 13+/-6 months, and 54 (63.5%) completed first year of treatment. Second year of treatment was delayed in some patients due to global COVID-19 pandemic. Most frequent adverse reactions were lymphocytopenia (43,5%), infections (20,8%) and fatigue (18,1%). After two months of first dose, CD19+ lymphocyte count showed greater reduction compared with CD4+ and CD8+. There were no grade 4 lymphocytopenia cases registered. Four (5.5%) serious adverse reactions were recorded. There were no cases of cladribine withdrawal because of adverse reactions. Conclusion(s): This cohort has similar characteristics to the CLARITY trial study population. Registered adverse reactions were comparable to previously described, showing higher incidence of fatigue and lower incidence of infections. This study confirms the short-term tolerability and safety profile of cladribine in real life scenarios.	false

0	Access Block in Australian Emergency Departments 2017-2020. OBJECTIVE: To describe Australian Emergency Department (ED) workload over the period 2017-2020 using data from twice annual Access Block Point Prevalence Studies, and to identify any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of demand and occupancy data provided by ACEM accredited EDs in voluntary surveys at the start of June and September 2017-2020. Hospitals answering all surveys were grouped and compared by jurisdiction and role delineation., RESULTS: 121 EDs were eligible, 63% supplied complete occupancy data and 53% complete demand data. Between the June 2017 and 2019 surveys, mean daily ED presentations increased 11.4% (P=0.0003). The number being treated at 10:00 rose by 27.7% (P<0.0001) and those experiencing access block (waiting for an inpatient bed, been in ED more than 8 hours) rose by 46.1% (P=0.001). Between the June 2019 and 2020 surveys, ED presentations fell by an average of 12.6% (P<0.0001), ward admissions were almost unchanged (-6.0%, P=NS), and patients who did not wait to be seen fell by 57.8% (P<0.0001). Major paediatric hospitals reported a 28% decrease in presentations. By September 2020, only the State of Victoria (ongoing state of emergency) and major paediatric hospitals reported demand lower than 2019 or occupancy lower than 2018., CONCLUSIONS: Occupancy increased by more than demand 2017-2019, with some decrease in 2020: in June presentations were 12.7% lower than 2019, in September back to the normal range outside Victorian and major paediatric hospitals. Future research needs to consider locality, role delineation and work practice change in comparing ED pandemic responses. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Predictive Value of Prognostic Nutritional Index on COVID-19 Severity. Background: The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) has been described as a simple risk-stratified tool for several diseases. We explored the predictive role of the PNI on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Methods: A total of 101 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study from January 2020 to March 2020. They were divided into two groups according to COVID-19 severity: non-critical (n = 56) and critical (n = 45). The PNI was calculated upon hospital admission: 10 x serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 x total lymphocyte count (/mm3). Critical COVID-19 was defined as having one of the following features: respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation; shock; organ dysfunction necessitating admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between the PNI with COVID-19 severity was analyzed. Results: The PNI was significantly lower in critically ill than that in non-critically ill patients (P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the PNI was a good discrimination factor for identifying COVID-19 severity (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the PNI to be an independent risk factor for critical illness due to COVID-19 (P = 0.002). Conclusions: The PNI is a valuable biomarker that could be used to discriminate COVID-19 severity. Copyright © 2021 Wang, Lin, Wei, Li, Liao, Yuan, Huang, Qin, Geng and Wang.	false
0	Viral Ribonucleic Acid Shedding and Transmission Potential of Asymptomatic and Paucisymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients. We studied the pattern and duration of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding in 32 asymptomatic and 11 paucisymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases. Viral RNA shedding in exhaled breath progressively diminished and became negative after 6 days of a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Therefore, the duration of isolation can be minimized to 6 days. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America.	false

The fate of nanoparticles in a biological system is determined by their protein corona, as remodeling of their surface properties through protein adsorption triggers specific recognition such as cell uptake and immune system clearance and nonspecific processes such as aggregation and precipitation. The corona is a result of nanoparticle-protein and protein-protein interactions and is influenced by particle design. The state-of-the-art design of biomedical nanoparticles is the core-shell structure exemplified by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) grafted with dense, well-hydrated polymer shells used for biomedical magnetic imaging and therapy. Densely grafted polymer chains form a polymer brush, yielding a highly repulsive barrier to the formation of a protein corona via nonspecific particle-protein interactions. However, recent studies showed that the abundant blood serum protein albumin interacts with dense polymer brush-grafted SPIONs. Herein, we use isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the nonspecific interactions between human serum albumin, human serum immunoglobulin G, human transferrin, and hen egg lysozyme with monodisperse poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline)-grafted SPIONs with different grafting densities and core sizes. These particles show similar protein interactions despite their different ""stealth"" capabilities in cell culture. The SPIONs resist attractive interactions with lysozymes and transferrins, but they both show a significant exothermic enthalpic and low exothermic entropic interaction with low stoichiometry for albumin and immunoglobulin G. Our results highlight that protein size, flexibility, and charge are important to predict protein corona formation on polymer brush-stabilized nanoparticles.

Identifying the individuals and geographical regions witnessing early infections or outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is helpful for studying the early epidemiology or even the origin of the novel coronavirus. Here, we put forward a strategy that can potentially contribute to this goal. Human body fluids and biological materials collected before the COVID-19 pandemic may serve as archives for retrospective testing of early human infections before the recent outbreaks. These have been routinely donated, collected, and archived, creating biorepositories or ""biobanks"" for clinical or research purposes. SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials and its antibodies have been confirmed in various types of biological samples from COVID-19 patients, including blood, sperm, umbilical cord blood, lung, heart, kidney and so on, making these biological archives as candidates for detecting early COVID-19 infections. Unlike sewage-based epidemiology which only provides information on the geographical aspect, viruses identified in archived human biological samples provide direct links to individuals, from whom a wealth of personal information including their profession, hobbies and activities, travel history, and previous exposure to wildlife can all be retrieved. By analyzing the patterns and links in the behavior of those early infected individuals, it is possible to trace the origin of the virus, for instance, in certain wild animals or local environments.

0	The Nucleocapsid protein triggers the main humoral immune response in COVID-19 patients. In order to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious progress has been made to identify infected patients and to detect patients with a positive immune response against the virus. Currently, attempts to generate a vaccine against the coronavirus are ongoing. To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity, we compared the IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected versus control patients by dot blot using recombinant viral particle proteins: N (Nucleocapsid), M (Membrane) and S (Spike). In addition, we used different protein fragments of the N and S protein to map immune epitopes. Most of the COVID-19 patients presented a specific immune response against the full length and fragments of the N protein and, to lesser extent, against a fragment containing amino acids 300-685 of the S protein. In contrast, immunoreactivity against other S protein fragments or the M protein was low. This response is specific for COVID-19 patients as very few of the control patients displayed immunoreactivity, likely reflecting an immune response against other coronaviruses. Altogether, our results may help develop method(s) for measuring COVID-19 antibody response, selectivity of methods detecting such SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and vaccine development.

0	High Prevalence of Hypocalcemia in Non-severe COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Case-Control Study. Purpose: To compare serum total calcium and phosphate levels in patients with non-severe COVID-19 with age, sex, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level matched healthy adult cohort. Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, medical records of patients (>=18 years) diagnosed as non-severe COVID-19 admitted at and discharged from our tertiary care institution during the period from April 10, 2020 and June 20, 2020 were retrieved. Baseline investigations, notably, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, magnesium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and C-reactive protein (CRP), were performed at admission before any form of calcium or vitamin D supplementation were considered. The biochemical parameters were compared with age, sex, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D matched healthy adult controls (1:1 ratio) derived from the Chandigarh Urban Bone Epidemiological Study (CUBES). Results: After exclusion, 72 patients with non-severe COVID-19 (63 mild and 9 moderate disease) and an equal number of healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Age, sex, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and albumin levels were matched between the 2 groups. Hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia were seen in 97 and 67% of the patients, respectively. The patients had lower serum calcium (P value <0.001) and phosphate (P = 0.007) compared with the controls. There was no statistically significant correlation between serum calcium and CRP. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia is highly prevalent even in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease probably implying that hypocalcemia is intrinsic to the disease. Prospective studies with larger number of patients are required to prove this hypothesis and unravel the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

0	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic's Effect on Critical Care Resources and Health-Care Providers: A Global Survey. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected ICUs and critical care health-care providers (HCPs) worldwide. Research Question: How do regional differences and perceived lack of ICU resources affect critical care resource use and the well-being of HCPs? Study Design and Methods: Between April 23 and May 7, 2020, we electronically administered a 41-question survey to interdisciplinary HCPs caring for patients critically ill with COVID-19. The survey was distributed via critical care societies, research networks, personal contacts, and social media portals. Responses were tabulated according to World Bank region. We performed multivariate log-binomial regression to assess factors associated with three main outcomes: limiting mechanical ventilation (MV), changes in CPR practices, and emotional distress and burnout. Result(s): We included 2,700 respondents from 77 countries, including physicians (41%), nurses (40%), respiratory therapists (11%), and advanced practice providers (8%). The reported lack of ICU nurses was higher than that of intensivists (32% vs 15%). Limiting MV for patients with COVID-19 was reported by 16% of respondents, was lowest in North America (10%), and was associated with reduced ventilator availability (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 2.10; 95% CI, 1.61-2.74). Overall, 66% of respondents reported changes in CPR practices. Emotional distress or burnout was high across regions (52%, highest in North America) and associated with being female (mechanical ventilation, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.33), being a nurse (ARR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.53), reporting a shortage of ICU nurses (ARR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33), reporting a shortage of powered air-purifying respirators (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.55), and experiencing poor communication from supervisors (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.46). Interpretation(s): Our findings demonstrate variability in ICU resource availability and use worldwide. The high prevalence of provider burnout and its association with reported insufficient resources and poor communication from supervisors suggest a need for targeted interventions to support HCPs on the front lines.Copyright © 2020 American College of Chest Physicians	false
0	Utilization of the Public Health Ordinance to prevent nosocomial spread in a case of acute measles-associated psychosis. Measles is a highly contagious disease. A 24 years old patient, recently exposed to measles (unvaccinated), presented in the emergency department with severe agitation, compatible with an acute psychotic episode, during the measles epidemic which spread in Israel in 2018-2019. Upon hospital admission, strict isolation was instructed, yet, without compliance, probably due to the patient's status. Measles diagnosis was promptly confirmed. As measles transmission was eminent, public health measures were employed through immediate implementation of the section 15 of the Public Health Ordinance, allowing for compulsory short-term isolation. The patient's condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure. This is in contrast to the current global use of Public Health laws to enforce strict quarantine and isolation on persons infected or potentially exposed to COVID-19. Nevertheless, minimizing infectious diseases transmission is a core function of public health law. Utilizing legal enforcement in circumstances of immediate public health hazard, such as nosocomial measles transmission, necessitates careful consideration. The integrative clinical and public health approach and prompt measures employed in this exceptional case, led to prevention of further infection spread.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Systematic Screening for Deep Vein Thrombosis in Critically Ill Inpatients With COVID-19: Impact on the Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism. Background: Several studies suggest an increased incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. However, evidence on how to prevent and even treat it is scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of two different methods for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE-DVT) diagnosis: systematic vs. clinically guided complete compression venous ultrasonography (CCUS). We conducted a monocentric, prospective, open-label, non-randomized study. All consecutive patients admitted in three intensive care units (ICUs) of University Hospital of Toulouse for COVID-19 pneumonia were included: one performed systematic screening for LE-DVT, the others did not. The primary outcome was the 21-day cumulative incidence of VTE. The secondary end points were the 21-day cumulative incidences of major bleeding and death. Results: Among the 78 patients included, 27 (34.6%) underwent systematic screening for DVT 7 +/- 2 days after ICU admission. Thirty-two patients (41.0%) were diagnosed with VTE, with a 21-day cumulative incidence of 42.3% (95% CI, 31.4-55.2), without difference between screened and non-screened patients (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI, 0.72-2.93). In the screened group, the frequency of isolated DVT was higher (25.9 vs. 5.9%, p-value = 0.027), but the frequency of pulmonary embolism was not reduced (25.9 vs. 29.4%, p-value = 0.745). The 21-day cumulative incidences of major bleeding and death were 9.6% (95% CI, 4.7-19.2) and 10.3% (95% CI, 5.0-20.8), respectively, without difference between the two groups. Conclusions: A systematic screening for DVT in patients hospitalized in ICU was not associated with a higher diagnosis of VTE or a reduced diagnosis of PE.

0	Dosing of thromboprophylaxis and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Introduction: A substantial proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop thromboembolic complications (ref 1-3). It is unclear what the optimal dose of thromboprophylaxis is for critically ill COVID- 19 patients and whether higher doses are associated with lower mortality rates. Objective(s): To evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method(s): This was an observational cohort study in a 600-bed emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two ICUs in March and April 2020 were eligible. Exclusion criteria were short length of stay, ongoing anticoagulation therapy due to diagnosed thromboembolic disease, or no initial thromboprophylaxis in the ICU. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose; low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium ( > 4500 IU but < 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or > 5000 IU but < 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose thromboprophylaxis (>= 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or >= 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). The three study groups reflected a gradual increase in dose of thromboprophylaxis during the study period. Result(s): A total of 152 patients were included, out of which 67 received low dose thromboprophylaxis, 48 medium dose thromboprophylaxis, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Demographic andclinical characteristics were similar in the three groups at baseline. Mortality was lower in patients treated with high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%), p = 0.02. The multivariable hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.13-0.87) with high vs low dose thromboprophylaxis when adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III and invasive respiratory support. There were fewer thromboembolic events in patients treated with high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%), p = 0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p = 0.16. Conclusion(s): Among critically ill Covid-19 patients, high dose thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of death and a lower cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events compared with lower doses. There was no difference in the proportions of bleeding events between the groups. (Table Presented).	false

0	Teledermatology application use in the COVID-19 era. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of telemedicine applications has increased throughout the United States. Using an algorithm to analyze mobile application rankings, we were able to examine how applications with telemedicine services have increased in prevalence and rank pre- and post- COVID-19. Telemedicine apps saw an increase of 210.92 ranked positions on average. Within US telehealth, skin conditions have become the fifth most common diagnosis. Widespread use of teledermatology has been well-accepted. Dermatologists and patients report high satisfaction using teledermatology during COVID-19 and intend to continue using these services in the future. COVID-19 has assisted in reducing physician concerns previously preventing some dermatologists from utilizing teledermatology in their services. Additionally, the geographical and socioeconomic barriers preventing some patients from receiving dermatologic care have been minimized through the use of teledermatology. Addressing these obstacles for dermatologic care improves healthcare equity.	false

0	Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic on Psychological Well-Being of the Pakistani General Population. Background and Objectives:  In order to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the countries took preventive measures such as lockdown and restrictions of movements. This can lead to effects on mental health of the population. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being and associated factors among the Pakistani general population. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 26th April and 15th May and included participants from all over the Pakistan. Attitudes and worriedness about COVID-19 pandemic were assessed using a structured questionnaire. A validated English and Urdu version of the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was used to assess the well-being. Factor analysis was done to extract the attitude item domains. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with poor well-being. Results: A total of 1,756 people participated in the survey. Almost half 50% of the participants were male, and a similar proportion was employed. About 41% of the participants were dependent on financial sources other than salary. News was considered a source of fear as 72% assumed that avoiding such news may reduce the fear. About 68% of the population was worried about contracting the disease. The most common coping strategies used during lockdown were spending quality time with family, eating healthy food, adequate sleep, and talking to friends on phone. Prevalence of poor well-being was found to be 41.2%. Female gender, being unemployed, living in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), fear of COVID-19, and having chronic illness were significantly associated with poor well-being. Similarly, coping strategies during lockdown (doing exercise; spending time with family; eating healthy food; having good sleep; contributing in social welfare work and spending time on hobbies) were also significantly associated with mental well-being. Conclusion:  We found a high prevalence 41.2% of poor well-being among the Pakistani general population. We also investigated risk factors of poor well-being which included female gender, unemployment, being resident of ICT and Sindh, fear, chronic illness, and absence of coping strategies. This calls for immediate action at population level in the form of targeted mass psychological support programs to improve the mental health of population during the COVID-19 crises.

0	Correcting hypophosphataemia in a paediatric patient with Sanjad-Sakati syndrome through a single oral dose of potassium phosphate intravenous solution. Sanjad-Sakati syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is quite common in Kuwait. Among a wide range of complications in Sanjad-Sakati syndrome patients is the vulnerability to infections and subsequent hypophosphataemia. Hypophosphataemia is a metabolic alteration that contributes to numerous consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, if hypophosphataemia is left unresolved, it may culminate in death. A 20-month-old boy of 2.5 kg body weight diagnosed with Sanjad-Sakati syndrome was initially admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit after recovering from COVID-19, and then shifted to the general ward. He was diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia and urinary tract infection. After 9 days, the patient showed severe hypophosphataemia with serum phosphate concentration reaching 0.33 mmol/L. Despite the availability of potassium phosphate intravenous solution, it was difficult to administer potassium phosphate intravenously because of the small body size and low body weight of the patient. Therefore, 0.6 mL potassium phosphate containing 2.4 mEq of potassium and 5.3 mEq of phosphate was administered through a nasogastric tube. The patient showed rapid response after a single dose through the nasogastric tube. Such an intervention in Sanjad-Sakati syndrome patients shows possible advantages of shifting drug administration from intravenous to oral route that includes a convenient route of administration, whether in the intensive care unit or in the general ward. Moreover, shifting drug administration from the intravenous to oral route overcomes the risk of cannula-induced infection and reduces nurses' workload. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection releated inflammatory and demyelinating disease; a brief case series. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically manifested by fever and respiratory symptoms caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory infection agent, various neurological syndromes have been reported with central and peripheral nervous system involvement, which may be associated with COVID-19. Most recently, a case diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) after an optic neuritis (ON) attack associated with COVID-19 infection has been published. Objective(s): In this case series we would like to to discuss the posibility of COVID-19-associated inflammatory / demyelinating disease. Method(s): We present 3 new cases admitted to our clinic with various neurological findings that all cases were affected by COVID-19. Imaging studies have shown that inflammatory / demyelinizing lesions appeared in different areas of the central nervous system which were accepted as an atypical demyelinating spectrum associated with SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): Case 1 A 28-year-old man presented with left hemiparesia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintense lesions adjacent to the lateral ventricles on T2-weighting with diffusion restriction and contrast enhancement. Chest CT scan was compatible with viral pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swab with a realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test resulted positively for SARS-CoV-2. After management of the infection, intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment was given to the patient and neurological deficits were fully recovered. Case 2 An 18-year-old woman presented with severe acute visual loss in the left eye and retrobulbar ON was diagnosed. Brain and cervical spine MRI showed multiple demyelinating lesions without gadolinium enhancement. SARS-CoV-2 PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab and immunological testing for IgG was negative whereas she was positive for IgM, compatible for a possible active infection. She was started on IVMP and despite completion to 10 days, recovery was only achieved by 70%. Case 3 A 48-year-old man presented with right hemiparesia. He was hospitalized with the diagnosis of Covid-19 10 days ago. Brain MRI showed T2- FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the supratentorial area and posterior fossa with diffusion restriction and contrast enhancement. Control MRI after 2 months revealed that the lesions significantly regressed spontanously and complete recovery was observed in neurological deficits. Conclusion(s): With increasing experience, it has been understood that the SARS-CoV-2 also has a neurotropic effect. These 3 cases suggest that the virus plays a role in the clinical onset of the inflammatory / demyelinating disease. The responsible mechanism here is probably not as a result of direct infectious effect of the virus rather a trigger role in autoimmune processes like other viral agents. Further long-term studies relating to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is warranted.	false
0	Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in India: An analysis of policy and technological interventions. Objectives: Following a surge in cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in June 2020, India became the third-worst affected country worldwide. This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes., Methods: Secondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions., Results: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic., Conclusions: Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth. The early implementation of lockdown initially decreased the doubling rate of cases and allowed time to upscale critical medical infrastructure. Measures such as asymptomatic testing, public-private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine can be developed and deployed in India., Public interest summary: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by lower case numbers and fewer deaths compared with numbers in many developed countries. This was mainly due to a stringent lockdown and demographic factors. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases in June 2020. Subsequently, India became the third-worst affected country worldwide. Low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) meant there was a shortage of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the health and economic damage resulting from the pandemic. In the future, measures such as asymptomatic testing, public-private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine against COVID-19 can be developed and rolled-out in India.

0	Characterizing COVID-19 and Influenza Illnesses in the Real World via Person-Generated Health Data. The fight against COVID-19 is hindered by similarly presenting viral infections that may confound detection and monitoring. We examined person-generated health data (PGHD), consisting of survey and commercial wearable data from individuals' everyday lives, for 230 people who reported a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 30, 2020, and April 27, 2020 (n = 41 with wearable data). Compared with self-reported diagnosed flu cases from the same time frame (n = 426, 85 with wearable data) or pre-pandemic (n = 6,270, 1,265 with wearable data), COVID-19 patients reported a distinct symptom constellation that lasted longer (median of 12 versus 9 and 7 days, respectively) and peaked later after illness onset. Wearable data showed significant changes in daily steps and prevalence of anomalous resting heart rate measurements, of similar magnitudes for both the flu and COVID-19 cohorts. Our findings highlight the need to include flu comparator arms when evaluating PGHD applications aimed to be highly specific for COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	The Importance of Early Recognition, Timely Management, and the Role of Healthcare Providers in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. In April 2020, a pediatric report of an unusual inflammatory illness associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to similar cases in Europe and North America, which was referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Herein, we describe the case of a 12-year-old boy who had a history of polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 and developed MIS-C approximately three weeks after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19. High fever with abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis was the initial manifestation of MIS-C, which could have been easily missed if the patient's history of COVID-19 was ignored. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered twice, 24 hours apart, five days after the onset of MIS-C, and the patient fully recovered without any obvious sequelae. Early recognition by disease awareness and prompt management are the keys to saving the lives of children affected by MIS-C.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.	false
0	Convalescent plasma for COVID-19 complicated by ARDS due to TRALI. Convalescent plasma, which contains antibodies from recovered individuals, has been used as an effective treatment for infectious diseases in the past and is currently being used as a potential treatment option for COVID-19. Multiple studies have reported this treatment to be safe. We report a case of a patient who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with features suggestive of transfusion-related acute lung injury after being treated with convalescent plasma for COVID-19. We emphasise the need to be aware of the potential risk of transfusion reactions and disease worsening with convalescent plasma administration and to weigh the risk and benefits of this therapy before administration to patients and propose that further study be done regarding the potential risks of convalescent plasma.

0	Clinical characteristics and risk factors for severe COVID-19 infections in Malaysia: A nationwide observational study. Background: COVID-19 emerged as a major public health outbreak in late 2019. Malaysia reported its first imported case on 25th January 2020, and adopted a policy of extensive contact tracing and hospitalising of all cases. We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases nationwide and determine the risk factors associated with disease severity., Method: Clinical records of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases aged >=12 years admitted to 18 designated hospitals in Malaysia between 1st February and 30th May 2020 with complete outcomes were retrieved. Epidemiological history, co-morbidities, clinical features, investigations, management and complications were captured using REDCap database. Variables were compared between mild and severe diseases. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to identify determinants for disease severity., Findings: The sample comprised of 5889 cases (median age 34 years, male 71.7%). Majority were mild (92%), and 3.3% required intensive care, with 80% admitted within the first five days. Older age (>=51 years), underlying chronic kidney disease and chronic pulmonary disease, fever, cough, diarrhoea, breathlessness, tachypnoea, abnormal chest radiographs and high serum CRP (>=5 mg/dL) on admission were significant determinants for severity (p<0.05). The case fatality rate was 1.2%, and the three commonest complications were liver injuries (6.7%), kidney injuries (4%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2.3%)., Interpretations: Lower case fatality rate was possibly contributed by young cases with mild diseases and early hospitalisation. Abnormal chest radiographic findings in elderly with tachypnoea require close monitoring in the first five days to detect early deterioration. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 Coinfection with Mycobacterium abscessus in a Patient with Multiple Myeloma. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic causing multiple fatalities and morbidities worldwide. We report a case of severe pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium abscessus in an elderly patient with multiple myeloma in Florida, USA. Case Presentation. An 84-year-old male with a medical history significant for multiple myeloma not in remission was sent to the emergency department to rule out COVID-19 infection prior to continuing his chemotherapy sessions. At presentation, he had nonspecific mild symptoms and an unremarkable physical examination. He had significant blood test findings including serum lactate dehydrogenase 373 U/L, high sensitive C-reactive protein 17.40 mg/l, and ferritin 415 ng/ml. Xpert-SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Chest radiograph revealed patchy areas of interstitial infiltrates in mid to lower lung zones. During his hospitalization course, his oxygenation deteriorated, requiring mechanical intubation. Repeat chest radiograph showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and eventually weaned off mechanical intubation and extubated. On the 11th day of admission, he was found to be bradycardic and in shock, and he was reintubated. His labs showed worsening inflammatory markers along with kidney dysfunction to the point of requiring renal replacement therapy. He received both convalescent plasma and remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Eventually, repeat blood cultures came back positive for the growth of acid-fast beaded bacilli. While awaiting final culture and sensitivity reports, his antibiotics were upgraded to cover possible nocardia infection. Repeat blood and sputum cultures resulted in growth of AFB bacilli Mycobacterium abscessus 1 week after., Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential and considering multiple coinfections, including atypical ones during this COVID-19 pandemic, such as the one that was discussed above, Mycobacterium abscessus, in order to provide goal-directed therapy.

0	Pneumothorax in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 Infection. Data on patient-related factors associated with pneumothorax among critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is limited. Reports of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggest that the COVID-19 infection could itself cause pneumothorax in addition to the ventilator-induced trauma among mechanically ventilated patients. Here, we report a case series of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. Consecutive cases of intubated patients in the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax were included. Data on their demographics, preexisting risk factors, laboratory workup, imaging findings, treatment, and survival were collected retrospectively between March and July 2020. Four out of five patients (4/5; 80%) had a bilateral pneumothorax, while one had a unilateral pneumothorax. Of the four patients with bilateral pneumothorax, three (3/4; 75%) had secondary bacterial pneumonia, two had pneumomediastinum and massive subcutaneous emphysema, and one of these two had an additional pneumoperitoneum. A surgical chest tube or pigtail catheter was placed for the management of pneumothorax. Three out of five patients with pneumothorax died (3/5; 60%), and all of them had bilateral involvement. The data from these cases suggest that pneumothorax is a potentially fatal complication of COVID-19 infection. Large prospective studies are needed to study the incidence of pneumothorax and its sequelae in patients with COVID-19 infection. Copyright © 2021 Raziye Ecem Akdogan et al.	false
0	Catching a resurgence: Increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA identified in wastewater 48 h before COVID-19 clinical tests and 96 h before hospitalizations. Curtailing the Spring 2020 COVID-19 surge required sweeping and stringent interventions by governments across the world. Wastewater-based COVID-19 epidemiology programs have been initiated in many countries to provide public health agencies with a complementary disease tracking metric and non-discriminating surveillance tool. However, their efficacy in prospectively capturing resurgences following a period of low prevalence is unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral signal was measured in primary clarified sludge harvested every two days at the City of Ottawa's water resource recovery facility during the summer of 2020, when clinical testing recorded daily percent positivity below 1%. In late July, increases of >400% in normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater were identified 48 h prior to reported >300% increases in positive cases that were retrospectively attributed to community-acquired infections. During this resurgence period, SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater preceded the reported >160% increase in community hospitalizations by approximately 96 h. This study supports wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance of populations in augmenting the efficacy of diagnostic testing, which can suffer from sampling biases or timely reporting as in the case of hospitalization census.

0	SARS-CoV-2 associated neuromyelitis optica. Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause numerous neurologic sequelae, including meningoencephalitis, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Following respiratory symptoms, acute transverse myelitis has also been reported. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a rare, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord. We report a case of NMO occurring in a patient who initially presented with acute meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology and, shortly thereafter, was found to be SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. Objective(s): NMO is a rare demyelinating disorder of the CNS. Some studies of NMO have suggested a triggering role for infectious agents, but the primary immunizing event remains poorly understood. Here we describe a case of NMO presenting in a SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patient after an initial hospitalization for meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology. Method(s): The case report was compiled using outside hospital and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital electronic medical record data. Figures were obtained through PACS and formatted in Microsoft Powerpoint. Result(s): NMO is diagnosed by the presence of at least 1 of 6 core clinical characteristics and detection of AQP4-IgG. The core clinical characteristics implicate 6 CNS regions including optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema of the dorsal medulla, brainstem, diencephalon, or cerebrum. Our patient had 2 core clinical characteristics including spinal cord lesion spanning greater than 3 segments and area postrema syndrome due to dorsal medullary lesion. Furthermore, his serum AQP4-IgG was positive. He developed these symptoms after becoming seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test. Conclusion(s): This is the first case report about NMO potentially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. While causality remains difficult to prove, the temporal relationship between SARSCoV- 2 infection and NMO attack is compelling for parainfectious phenomenon.	false
0	Impact of Serum 25(OH) Vitamin D Level on Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 in Turkey. BACKGROUND: Because of the lack of sufficient data, we aimed to investigate the role of serum 25(OH) vitamin D level on COVID severity and related mortality., METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. Data, including sociodemographic features, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were recorded for each study participant. Patients were stratified into different vitamin D groups; Normal (Serum 25(OH) vitamin D level >30 ng/mL), Vitamin D insufficiency (21-29 ng/mL), and deficiency (<20 ng/mL). The severity of COVID was classified according to the Chinese Clinical Guideline for classification of COVID-19 severity. Mortality data were determined for participants. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of in-hospital mortality., RESULTS: Overall, 149 COVID-19 patients (females 45.6%, mean age 63.5 +/- 15.3 (range 24-90 years) years) were included. Forty-seven patients (31.5%) had moderate COVID-19, whereas 102 patients (68.5%) had severe-critical COVID-19. The mean 25(OH) vitamin D level was 15.2 +/- 10.3 ng/mL. Thirty-four (22.8%) and 103 (69.1%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, respectively. Mean serum 25(OH) vitamin D level was significantly lower in patients with severe-critical COVID-19 compared with moderate COVID-19 (10.1 +/- 6.2 vs. 26.3 +/- 8.4 ng/mL, respectively, p<0.001). Vitamin D insufficiency was present in 93.1% of the patients with severe-critical COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, serum albumin and, 25(OH) vitamin D level were independent predictors of mortality., CONCLUSION: Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was independently associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Evaluation of a rapid antigen test (PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test device) for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. Objectives: There is limited information on the performance of rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic individuals. In this field study, we evaluated the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for this purpose. Method(s): A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Result(s): Household contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-7) after diagnosis of the index case, whereas non-household contacts (n = 296) were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1-7) after exposure. In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI 37.4-58.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.3-100), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI 38.9-62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI 16.3-61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (p < 0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts. Discussion(s): The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative to pinpoint test sensitivity.Copyright © 2021 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false
0	Site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced in insect and human cells. Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S – insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complimentary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	On the importance of the linking chemistry for the PEGylation of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The typical method for minimizing serum protein adsorption in biological settings and prolonging blood circulation time of nanoparticles, is to anchor hydrophilic polymers (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol), PEG) on the particle surface, which is most often done by covalent attachment (PEGylation). Herein, different PEGylation methods were realised and compared to functionalize mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). First, reactive groups were installed using post-grafting procedures with different functional silanes. Further, PEGs carrying a functional group and having different chain lengths and termini, were used. The grafting efficacy as well as the structural and physicochemical characteristics of the resulting particles were determined. Finally, the serum protein adsorption behaviour of these functionalized particles was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. The type of selected coupling method was shown to strongly influence the grafting efficiency as well as the resulting protein adsorption. The results highlight the importance of the right choice of the linking chemistry when aiming at surface functionalization of nanoparticles. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

0	Mass severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing of asymptomatic healthcare personnel. Mass asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplified testing of healthcare personnel (HCP) was performed at a large tertiary health system. A low period-prevalence of positive HCP was observed. Of those who tested positive, half had mild symptoms in retrospect. HCP with even mild symptoms should be isolated and tested.	false
0	B cell memory: understanding COVID-19. Immunological memory is a mechanism to protect us against reinfection. Antibodies produced by B cells are integral to this defense strategy and underlie virtually all vaccine success. Here, we explain how B cells memory is generated by infection and vaccination, what influences its efficacy and its persistence, and how characterizing these parameters in the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will help achieve protective immunity through vaccination.

0	Development of a portable MIP-based electrochemical sensor for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is expanding around the globe. Hence, accurate and cheap portable sensors are crucially important for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as robust synthetic molecular recognition materials with antibody-like ability to bind and discriminate between molecules can perfectly serve in building selective elements in such sensors. Herein, we report for the first time on the development of a MIP-based electrochemical sensor for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (ncovNP). A key element of the sensor is a disposable sensor chip - thin film electrode - interfaced with a MIP-endowed selectivity for ncovNP and connected with a portable potentiostat. The resulting ncovNP sensor showed a linear response to ncovNP in the lysis buffer up to 111 fM with a detection and quantification limit of 15 fM and 50 fM, respectively. Notably, the sensor was capable of signaling ncovNP presence in nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 positive patients. The presented strategy unlocks a new route for the development of rapid COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false

0	Evaluation of Hypertriglyceridemia in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Receiving Propofol. Objectives: To report the prevalence of, and evaluate risk factors for, the development of hypertriglyceridemia (defined as a serum triglyceride level of > 400 mg/dL) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received propofol., Design: Single-center, retrospective, observational analysis., Setting: Brigham and Women's Hospital, a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA., Patients: All ICU patients who with coronavirus disease 19 who received propofol between March 1, 2020, and April 20, 2020., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: The major outcome of this analysis was to report the prevalence of, and risk factors for, the development of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with coronavirus disease 19 who received propofol. Minor outcomes included the development of acute pancreatitis and description of propofol metrics. Of the 106 patients that were included, 60 (56.6%) developed hypertriglyceridemia, with a median time to development of 46 hours. A total of five patients had clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis, with one patient having confirmatory imaging. There was no difference in the dose or duration of propofol in patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia compared with those who did not. In the patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia, 35 patients (58.5%) continued receiving propofol for a median duration of 105 hours. Patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia had elevated levels of inflammatory markers., Conclusions: Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly observed in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received propofol. Neither the cumulative dose nor duration of propofol were identified as a risk factor for the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Due to the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in this patient population, monitoring of serum triglyceride levels should be done frequently in patients who require more than 24 hours of propofol. Many patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia were able to continue propofol in our analysis after reducing the dose. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Vitamin D insufficiency as a potential culprit in critical COVID-19 patients. Background: As an immune modulator, vitamin D has been implicated in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcome. We aim to systematically explore the association of vitamin D serum levels with COVID-19 severity and prognosis. Method(s): The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from six studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. Result(s): Mean vitamin D serum level of 376 patients, was 21.9 nmol/L (95% CI = 15.36-28.45). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.1%, p <.001). Patients with poor prognosis (N = 150) had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D compared with those with good prognosis (N = 161), representing an adjusted standardized mean difference of -0.58 (95% Cl = -0.83 to -0.34, p <.001). Conclusion(s): Serum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients' potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	A trans -complementation system for SARS-CoV-2. The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development. Here we report a trans -complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans -complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans- complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. The results suggest that the trans -complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.	false
0	Social stigmatisation among COVID-19 patients: Addressing a potential source of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare staff in cardiac emergency and cardiac care units. During our routine work, we noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses among patients in the cardiac unit, which led to an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases among hospital staff. We found that patients hid their symptoms from the emergency doctors and attributed those symptoms to cardiac or other causes. Social stigmatisation appeared to be the root cause for hiding their symptoms. Hence, we recommended a strategy to introduce psychological counselling of patients who were suspected to be infected with COVID-19, with a normal cardiac workup to overcome social stigmatisation and save our general wards from COVID-19.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Are Correlated to Disease Severity in COVID-19 Convalescent Individuals. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had extreme consequences for the healthcare system and has led to calls for diagnostic tools to monitor and understand the transmission, pathogenesis, and epidemiology, as well as to evaluate future vaccination strategies. In this study, we have developed novel, to our knowledge, flexible ELISA-based assays for specific detection of human SARS-CoV-2 Abs against the receptor-binding domain, including an Ag sandwich ELISA relevant for large population screening and three isotype-specific assays for in-depth diagnostics. Their performance was evaluated in a cohort of 350 convalescent participants with previous COVID-19 infection, ranging from asymptomatic to critical cases. We mapped the Ab responses to different areas on protein N and S and showed that the IgM, A, and G Ab responses against receptor-binding domain are significantly correlated to the disease severity. These assays and the data generated from them are highly relevant for diagnostics and prognostics and contribute to the understanding of long-term COVID-19 immunity.	false
0	Convalescent Plasma Antibody Levels and the Risk of Death from Covid-19. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) under the presumption that such plasma contains potentially therapeutic antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. Whether convalescent plasma with high antibody levels rather than low antibody levels is associated with a lower risk of death is unknown., METHODS: In a retrospective study based on a U.S. national registry, we determined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in convalescent plasma used to treat hospitalized adults with Covid-19. The primary outcome was death within 30 days after plasma transfusion. Patients who were enrolled through July 4, 2020, and for whom data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma transfusions and on 30-day mortality were available were included in the analysis., RESULTS: Of the 3082 patients included in this analysis, death within 30 days after plasma transfusion occurred in 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group. The association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with the risk of death from Covid-19 was moderated by mechanical ventilation status. A lower risk of death within 30 days in the high-titer group than in the low-titer group was observed among patients who had not received mechanical ventilation before transfusion (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.91), and no effect on the risk of death was observed among patients who had received mechanical ventilation (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32)., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, transfusion of plasma with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels was associated with a lower risk of death than transfusion of plasma with lower antibody levels.

0	Epitope-resolved profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response identifies cross-reactivity with endemic human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome shares regions of conservation with endemic human coronaviruses (CoVs), but it remains unknown to what extent these may be cross-recognized by the antibody response. Here, we study cross-reactivity using a highly multiplexed peptide assay (PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of IgG reactivity across all human CoVs in both COVID-19 convalescent and negative donors. PepSeq resolves epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins that are commonly targeted in convalescent donors, including several sites also recognized in some uninfected controls. By comparing patterns of homologous reactivity between CoVs and using targeted antibody-depletion experiments, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies that cross-recognize pandemic and endemic CoV antigens at two Spike S2 subunit epitopes. We further show that these cross-reactive antibodies preferentially bind endemic homologs. Our findings highlight sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 response appears to be shaped by previous CoV exposures and which have the potential to raise broadly neutralizing responses.

0	Survey of Saliva Components and Virus Sensors for Prevention of COVID-19 and Infectious Diseases. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers saliva contact the lead transmission mean of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Saliva droplets or aerosols expelled by sneezing, coughing, breathing, and talking may carry this virus. People in close distance may be exposed directly to these droplets or indirectly when touching the droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces and ending up contracting COVID-19 after touching the mucosa tissue of their faces. It is of great interest to quickly and effectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an environment, but the existing methods only work in laboratory settings, to the best of our knowledge. However, it may be possible to detect the presence of saliva in the environment and proceed with prevention measures. However, detecting saliva itself has not been documented in the literature. On the other hand, many sensors that detect different organic components in saliva to monitor a person's health and diagnose different diseases, ranging from diabetes to dental health, have been proposed and they may be used to detect the presence of saliva. This paper surveys sensors that detect organic and inorganic components of human saliva. Humidity sensors are also considered in the detection of saliva because a large portion of saliva is water. Moreover, sensors that detect infectious viruses are also included as they may also be embedded into saliva sensors for a confirmation of the presence of the virus. A classification of sensors by their working principles and the substances they detect is presented, including the sensors' specifications, sample size, and sensitivity. Indications of which sensors are portable and suitable for field application are presented. This paper also discusses future research and challenges that must be resolved to realize practical saliva sensors. Such sensors may help minimize the spread of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious diseases.	false
0	Percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: Assessing patient benefits and clinician risks. Introduction: Many patients with COVID-19 require long-term mechanical ventilation. Early tracheostomy may offer a route to weaning ventilation, decreased sedation, and reduced cardiovascular support for intensive care patients. However, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, advice in the UK was to wait for 14 days and/or a negative COVID-19 test due to perceived risks to the operator [1,2]. Objective(s): To determine the impact of early percutaneous tracheostomies ( < 10 days after intubation) on sedation andvasopressor requirements. In addition, we examine whether modifications to reduce viral exposure avoided COVID-19 transmission to the treating team. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis of all mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients receiving tracheostomies at a singlecentre general intensive care unit in the UK from 19 March to 29 June 2020 (n = 31). This involved a modified percutaneous technique to minimise aerosol generation. We compare patient sedation and cardiovascular support over a five-day follow-up period, as well as 30-day discharge and mortality, with an indicative control group of five clinically similar patients who did not receive a tracheostomy as they were transferred to different hospitals for exogenous reasons of ICU bed capacity. The treating team were also screened for COVID-19 antibodies > 2 weeks after the procedures. Result(s): Compared to baseline preceding tracheostomy, patients showed a decrease in both sedative and cardiovascular support requirements with no similar improvements in the control group. Median sedative requirements decreased from an average of over 10 mg/hr of both morphine and midazolam or equivalent to less than 5 mg/hr of both five days after tracheostomy, whilst median sedation remained above 10mg/hr of both for the controls. Median noradrenaline decreased from 5 to 0 mcg/min over the same period, whilst the control group increased from 2.66 to 8 mcg/min. After 30 days, 15 tracheostomy patients (48.3%) had been discharged from hospital, two (6.5%) were receiving ongoing care on step-down wards, and 14 were deceased (45.1%). Of the indicative control group, after 30 days since meeting the criteria for tracheostomy two (40%) had been discharged and three (60%) were deceased. Of the 31 procedures only two involved complications (6.4%); both featured transient desaturation and hypoxia but neither resulted in lasting sequelae. In addition, we find that all clinicians involved with tracheostomies received negative COVID-19 antibody tests. Conclusion(s): In a small sample size, we demonstrate the potential for early tracheostomy as a strategy for reducing sedative and vasopressor requirements. This may improve outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients in a pandemic setting without compromising the safety of the treating team.	false

0	OUTCOMES AFTER VASCULAR SURGERY PROCEDURES IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION: A NATIONAL MULTICENTRE COHORT STUDY (COVID-VAS). OBJECTIVES: To analyze the outcome of vascular procedures performed in patients with COVID-19 infection during the 2020 pandemic., METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. We analyzed data from 75 patients with COVID-19 infection undergoing vascular surgery procedures in 17 hospitals across Spain and Andorra between March and May 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Clinical Trials registry number NCT04333693., RESULTS: The mean age was 70.9 (45-94) and 58 (77.0%) patients were male. 70.7% had postoperative complications, 36.0% of patients experienced respiratory failure, 22.7% acute renal failure and 22.7% acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). All-cause 30-days mortality rate was 37.3%. Multivariate analysis identified age >65 years (p=0.009), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification IV (p=0.004), preoperative lymphocyte count <0.6 (x109/L) (p=0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)>500 (UI/L) (p=0.004), need for invasive ventilation (p=0.043), postoperative acute renal failure (p=0.001), ARDS (p=0.003) and major amputation (p=0.009) as independent variables associated with mortality. Preoperative coma (p=0.001), quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score >=2 (p=0.043), lymphocytes <0.6 (x109/L) (p=0.019) leucocytes>11.5 (x109/L) (p=0.007) and serum ferritin>1800 mg/dL (p=0.004), bilateral lung infiltrates on thorax computed tomography (p=0.025), and postoperative acute renal failure (p=0.009) increased the risk of postoperative ARDS. qSOFA score >=2 was the only risk factor associated with postoperative sepsis (p=0.041)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 infection undergoing vascular surgery procedures showed poor 30-days survival. Age>65 years, preoperative lymphocytes <0.6 (x109/L) and LDH>500 (UI/L), and postoperative acute renal failure, ARDS and need for major amputation were identified as prognostic factors of 30-days mortality.

0	Estimating Aerosol Transmission Risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City Public Schools During Reopening. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among students and teachers in New York City public schools, the largest school system in the US. Classroom measurements conducted from December 2017 to September 2018 were used to estimate risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a modified Wells-Riley equation under a steady-state conditions and varying exposure scenarios (infectious student versus teacher, susceptible student versus teacher, with and without masks). We then used multivariable linear regression with GEE to identify school and classroom factors that impact transmission risk. Overall, 101 classrooms in 19 schools were assessed, 86 during the heating season, 69 during cooling season, and 54 during both. The mean probability of transmission was generally low but varied by scenario (range: 0.0015-0.81). Transmission rates were higher during the heating season (beta=0.108, p=0.010), in schools in higher income neighborhoods (>80K versus 20K-40K beta=0.196, p<0.001) and newer buildings (<50 years beta=0.237, p=<0.001; 50-99 years beta=0.230, p=0.013 versus 100+ years) and lower in schools with mechanical ventilation (beta=0.141, p=0.057). Surprisingly, schools located in older buildings and lower-income neighborhoods had lower transmission probabilities, likely due to the greater outdoor airflow associated with an older, non-renovated buildings that allow air to leak in (i.e. drafty buildings). Despite the generally low risk of school-based transmission found in this study, with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence rising in New York City this risk will increase and additional mitigation steps should be implemented in schools now.

The latest developments in thin-film-transistor digital-microfluidics (TFT-DMF, also known by the commercial name aQdrop TM) are reported, and proof of concept application to molecular diagnostics (e.g. for coronavirus disease, COVID-19) at the point-of-need demonstrated. The TFT-DMF array has 41 thousand independently addressable electrodes that are capable of manipulating large numbers of droplets of any size and shape, along any pathway to perform multiple parallel reactions. Droplets are continually tracked and adjusted through closed-loop feedback enabled by TFT based sensors at each array element. The sample-to-answer molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) includes nucleic acid extractions from saliva, removal of dsDNA and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This proof of concept illustrates how the highly configurable TFT-DMF technology can perform many reactions in parallel and thus support the processing of a range of sample types followed by multiple complex multi-step assays.	false
0	Probable delirium is a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in frail, older adults: a cohort study of 322 hospitalised and 535 community-based older adults. BACKGROUND: Frailty, increased vulnerability to physiological stressors, is associated with adverse outcomes. COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, comorbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. SETTING: Admissions to St Thomas' Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. SUBJECTS: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n=322); unscheduled hospital admission between 1 March 2020 and 5 May 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n=535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from 24 March (application launch) to 8 May 2020. METHOD(S): Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. RESULT(S): Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail adults with delirium.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society. All rights reserved.

Objective: To analyze the nutritional status and explore the nutritional intervention of 37 adult patients with common-type Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) in chenzhou. Methods: According to the principles of routine nutritional support for pneumonia patients and the ""nutritional dietary guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 "" issued by National Health Commission of the PRC, nutritional recipes were designed for 37 patients with common-type COVID-19 in the Second People's Hospital of Chenzhou from January 23 to April 20, 2020.The patient's diet was provided by the hospital throughout the day, and oral nutritional supplements were provided for those with insufficient food intake. Demographic and epidemiological data of the patients and nutrition-related indicators on the 1st, 5th and 10th day of hospitalization were collected to understand the nutritional status of the patients during hospitalization. Results: On the first day, there were 31 patients (83.8%) with NRS 2002 score >=3 points, 32 patients (86.5%) had a decrease in food intake, 25 patients (67.6%) with blood glucose >=6.1 mmol/L, 15 patients(40.5%)with C-reactive protein (CRP)>8 mg/L, 10 patients (27.0%) with total lymphocyte count<4x109/L. 4 patients (10.8%) with hemoglobin < 110 g/L, 5 patients (13.5%)with IL-6(Interleukin6)>7 pg/L. After giving the hospital diet and oral nutrition supplement, the average weight and BMI of the patients decreased on the 5th day compared with the 1st day(P< 0.05), but recovered on the 10th day with no difference compared with the first day(P>0.05). NRS 2002 scores were lower on the 5th and 10th day than on the 1st day(P< 0.05). There were 23 patients (62.2%) with reduced food intake on the 5th day and only 4 patients (10.8%) on the 10th day. Serum albumin and hemoglobin levels increased on the 10th day compared with the first day(P< 0.05). The levels of blood glucose and interleukin-6(IL-6)were lower on the 5th and 10th day than on the 1st day (P< 0.05). Compared with the first day, the level of blood calcium, the number of CD3+ CD4 and the total number of lymphocytes increased on the 5th and 10th day (P<0.05), CRP level and NLR(neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) decreased on the 10th day(P< 0.05). Conclusion(s): Nutritional intervention in the treatment of common-type COVID-19 can improve serum albumin, blood calcium, hemoglobin and blood glucose levels, and reduce inflammatory response.Copyright © 2020 Chinese Medical Association"	false
0	The Artificial-Liver Blood-Purification System Can Effectively Improve Hypercytokinemia for COVID-19. Since the December 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, the infection has spread locally and globally resulting in a pandemic. As the numbers of confirmed diagnoses and deaths continue to rise, COVID-19 has become the focus of international public health. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and there is no effective treatment yet. New treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment success rate of severe and critically ill patients. Increasing evidence has shown that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The artificial-liver blood-purification system (ALS) is expected to improve the outcome of the cytokine storm. In the present study, the levels of cytokines were detected in 12 COVID-19 patients pre- and post-ALS with promising results. The present study shows promising evidence that ALS can block the cytokine storm, rapidly remove the inflammatory mediators, and hopefully, suppress the progression of the disease, thereby providing a new strategy for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.© Copyright © 2020 Guo, Xia, Wang, Yu, Zhang, Chen, Shi, Chen, Zhang, Xu, Xu, Sheng, Qiu and Li.	false
0	Burnout Prevalence and Its Associated Factors among Malaysian Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Embedded Mixed-Method Study. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health threat and has placed an extraordinary demand on healthcare workers around the world. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors and experience among Malaysian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic through an embedded mixed-method study design. We found that more than half of Malaysian healthcare workers in this sample experienced burnout. Direct involvement in COVID-19 screening or treatment, having a medical condition, and less psychological support in the workplace emerged to be the significant factors in personal-, work-, and patient-related burnout. Participants described their workloads, uncertainties caused by the pandemic, challenging work-family balance, and stretched workplace relationships as the sources of burnout. Exhaustion appeared to be the major symptom, and many participants utilized problem-focused coping to deal with the adversities experienced during the pandemic. Participants reported physical-, occupational-, psychological-, and social-related negative impacts resulting from burnout. As the pandemic trajectory is yet unknown, these findings provide early insight and guidance for possible interventions.	false
0	Healthcare Workers Who Work With COVID-19 Patients Are More Physically Exhausted and Have More Sleep Problems. In this survey study of 7,208 Dutch healthcare workers, we investigate whether healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients experience lower general health, more physical and mental exhaustion and more sleep problems than other healthcare workers. Additionally, we study whether there are differences in well-being within the group of healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients, based on personal and work characteristics. We find healthcare workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients report more sleep problems and are more physically exhausted than those who are not in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Mental exhaustion and general health do not significantly differ between healthcare workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients and those who are not. Among healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, lower well-being on one or more indicators is reported by those who are female, living alone, without leadership role, or without sufficient protective equipment. Regarding age, physical exhaustion is more prevalent under healthcare workers older than 55 years, whereas mental exhaustion is more prevalent under healthcare workers younger than 36 years. These results stress the need of mental and physical support of healthcare workers during a pandemic, catered to the needs of healthcare workers themselves.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) particularly in mechanically ventilated adults with severe pneumonia. The extremely high prevalence of DVT in the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been established between 25 and 84% based on studies including systematic duplex ultrasound of the lower limbs when prophylactic anticoagulation was systematically administrated. DVT prevalence has been shown to be markedly higher than in mechanically ventilated influenza patients (6-8%). Unusually high inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype represents a striking feature of COVID-19 patients, as reflected by markedly elevated reactive protein C, fibrinogen, interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII. Moreover, in critically ill patients, venous stasis has been associated with the prothrombotic phenotype attributed to COVID-19, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Venous stasis results among others from immobilization under muscular paralysis, mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, and pulmonary microvascular network injuries or occlusions. Venous return to the heart is subsequently decreased with increase in central and peripheral venous pressures, marked proximal and distal veins dilation, and drops in venous blood flow velocities, leading to a spontaneous contrast ""sludge pattern"" in veins considered as prothrombotic. Together with endothelial lesions and hypercoagulability status, venous stasis completes the Virchow triad and considerably increases the prevalence of DVT and PE in critically ill COVID-19 patients, therefore raising questions regarding the optimal doses for thromboprophylaxis during ICU stay.

0	Clinical progression of the first wave of novel coronavirus infection in Ostrava. OBJECTIVES: The first case of coronavirus infection in the Moravian-Silesian Region was diagnosed on March 12, 2020. The study aimed to describe the first wave and clinical manifestation of the coronavirus epidemic at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Ostrava. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample comprised a total of 195 patients requiring hospitalization at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Ostrava between March 1 and August 31, 2020. The virus was diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs in 192 patients and from the bronchoalveolar lavage in one patient. In the other two patients, serological tests were applied using virus neutralization assays and ELISA specific antibodies. RESULT(S): The sample included 100 men and 95 women. The mean age was 69.5 years. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia, observed in 123 patients (63 %). Respiratory symptoms without pneumonia were seen in 37 patients (19 %); loss of smell and taste in 14 patients (7 %); cardiovascular complications in 9 patients (5 %); acute psychosis in 2 patients (1 %); and diarrhea and vomiting in 25 patients (13 %). The remaining 23 patients (12 %) did not present any symptoms. The mean length of hospital stay was 11 days. The most frequent comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (70 %). A total of 39 patients died (20 %); their mean age was 77 years. Mechanical ventilation was started in 16 patients, of whom 7 died (43 %). The treatment was mostly symptomatic. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 21 patients (11 %), favipiravir to 26 patients (13 %) and remdesivir to 13 patients (6 %). CONCLUSION(S): Respiratory complications predominated in the majority of patients with coronavirus infection. In most cases, the treatment was symptomatic. One-fifth of the patients, mostly elderly ones, died.	false
0	Tocilizumab in the Management of COVID-19: A Preliminary Report. Importance: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death due to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness. Objective(s): To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab. Design, setting, participants: Retrospective study of 1938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001). Conclusion and relevance: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the true effect of Tocilizumab in this condition.Copyright © 2020 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation	false
0	COVID-19 and pediatric asthma: Clinical and management challenges. Asthma is the most frequent chronic condition in childhood and a current concern exists about asthma in the pediatric population and its risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-alpha production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma-obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions. Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease. Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Focus on asthma control, risk stratification, and medication adherence will be essential to allow children with asthma to return safely to school.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

0	Codon arrangement modulates MHC-I peptides presentation: implications for a SARS-CoV-2 peptide-based vaccine. Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.	false
0	iCAT: diagnostic assessment tool of immunological history using high-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing. <ns3:p>The pathogen exposure history of an individual is recorded in their T-cell repertoire and can be accessed through the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs) if the tools to identify them were available. For each T-cell, the TCR loci undergoes genetic rearrangement that creates a unique DNA sequence. In theory these unique sequences can be used as biomarkers for tracking T-cell responses and cataloging immunological history. We developed the immune Cell Analysis Tool (iCAT), an R software package that analyzes TCR sequencing data from exposed (positive) and unexposed (negative) samples to identify TCR sequences statistically associated with positive samples. The presence and absence of associated sequences in samples trains a classifier to diagnose pathogen-specific exposure. We demonstrate the high accuracy of iCAT by testing on three TCR sequencing datasets. First, iCAT successfully diagnosed smallpox vaccinated versus naïve samples in an independent cohort of mice with 95% accuracy. Second, iCAT displayed 100% accuracy classifying naïve and monkeypox vaccinated mice. </ns3:p><ns3:p> Finally, we demonstrate the use of iCAT on human samples before and after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 global pandemic. We were able to correctly classify the exposed samples with perfect accuracy. These experimental results show that iCAT capitalizes on the power of TCR sequencing to simplify infection diagnostics. iCAT provides the option of a graphical, user-friendly interface on top of usual R interface allowing it to reach a wider audience.</ns3:p>	false
0	Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Spontaneous Reporting: Global and National Time-Series Analyses. PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely reported to present stress to medical systems globally and to disrupt the lives of patients and health care practitioners (HCPs). Given that spontaneous reporting heavily relies on both HCPs and patients, an understandable question is whether the stress of the pandemic has diminished spontaneous reporting. Herein, the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events was assessed., METHODS: Spontaneous-report counts from 119 weeks (January 1, 2018, to April 12, 2020) were identified using Pfizer's safety database and were analyzed. Autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to aggregated and disaggregated time series (TSs). Model residuals were charted on individual-value and moving-range charts and exponentially weighted moving-average charts for the identification of statistically unexpected changes associated with the pandemic., FINDINGS: Overall, the reporting of serious adverse events showed no unexpected decline. Total global reporting declined, driven by HCP reporting (of both serious and nonserious events), starting after week 8 of 2020 and exceeding model expectations by week 15 of 2020, suggesting the pandemic as an assignable cause. However, reporting remained within longer-term historical ranges. The TS from Japan was the only national TS that showed a significant decline, and an unusual periodicity related to national holidays. A few countries, notably Taiwan, showed unexpected statistical increases in reporting associated with the pandemic, commencing as early as week 3 of 2020. In the literature, the reporting of adverse drug events was stable. Ancillary findings included prevalent year-end/beginning reporting minima, with more reports from HCPs than from consumers., IMPLICATIONS: Using data from a large-scale and diverse safety database from a pharmaceutical company, a significant global decline in total reporting was detected, driven by HCPs, not consumers, and reports of nonserious events, consistent with the pandemic as an assignable cause, but the reporting remained within long-term ranges, suggesting relative durability. Importantly, the analyses found no unexpected decline in overall reporting of serious events. Future avenues of research include the use of data from large-scale, publicly available spontaneous reporting systems for assessing the generalizability of the present findings and whether they correlate with impaired signal detection, as well as a follow-up analysis of whether the effects on spontaneous reporting abate after the pandemic.

0	A parsimonious approach for spatial transmission and heterogeneity in the COVID-19 propagation. Raw data on the number of deaths at a country level generally indicate a spatially variable distribution of COVID-19 incidence. An important issue is whether this pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies and sanitary measures overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease.

0	"Nicotinic Cholinergic System and COVID-19: In Silico Identification of Interactions Betaetween alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and the Cryptic Epitopes of SARS-Co-V and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human alpha7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human alpha7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.

0	Low-dose and oral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may help us understand and prevent severe COVID-19. Background: The effectiveness and sustainability of current public health interventions designed to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission remain of great concern in many settings, especially in the absence of a transmission-preventing vaccine. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that a more targeted set of interventions focusing on preventing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rather than SARS-CoV-2 transmission, would be less disruptive to society. To identify these, it would be helpful to better understand how the infecting dose of SARS-CoV-2 and its route of infection influence the clinical outcome, immunological protection, and likelihood of onward transmission. Proposal: It is suggested that carefully controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies involving intranasal and oral administration of progressively increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2, starting with low levels, to healthy young adult volunteers may be the most expeditious and definitive way to answer these questions. Such studies would differ in objective from CHIM proposals designed to expedite vaccine development, although the latter might be adapted to address some of the questions raised here. Implications: Results from the studies proposed here could help elucidate the relationship of infection to COVID-19 and thereby provide a scientific basis for more targeted and sustainable application of public health control measures, and inform the design of improved immunotherapeutics and more targeted vaccine development.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Community structured model for vaccine strategies to control COVID19 spread: a mathematical study. Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals’ duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPI’s relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPI’s are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R 0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPI’s are not immediately relaxed.	false
0	Loss of furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV)-producing worldwide pandemic1, has a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein that is absent in other group 2B CoVs2. To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 deleting the furin cleavage site (DELTAPRRA). SARS-CoV-2 DELTAPRRA replicates had faster kinetics, improved fitness in Vero E6 cells, and reduced spike protein processing as compared to parental SARS-CoV-2. However, the DELTAPRRA mutant had reduced replication in a human respiratory cell line and was attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Despite reduced disease, the DELTAPRRA mutant conferred protection against rechallenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, COVID-19 patient sera and receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies had lower neutralization values against the DELTAPRRA mutant versus parental SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased particle/PFU ratio. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the importance of this site in evaluating antibody neutralization activity.	false
0	Stress level assessment among healthcare workers involved in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients, A cross sectional study. COVID SCREAM (Stress in Critical caRE health workers Assessment Model). Introduction: The declaration of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic lead to the implementation of surge plans and an increase in the number of intensive care units beds across most healthcare facilities. Health care workers (HCWs) in the ICU are frontlines of this crisis as they deal with critically ill patients affected by COVID-19 which can potentially affect their mental wellbeing and causes different levels of stress and psychological disorders. Objective(s): We aimed to determine the prevalence of stress among HCWs involved in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patient, identify the risk factors associated with stress, and highlight the availability of psychological support provided to HCWs and its effectiveness. Method(s): A cross sectional multicenter, international study using a web-based questionnaire of 27 questions including the Perceived Stress Scale [PSS] for assessment of stress level. Questions to identify the risk factors for stress and the psychological support provided by each health care facility in addition to the socio-demographic characteristics were included. Result(s): We received a total 1501 response from 59 countries, 526 (35%) were from Europe, 432 (28.7%) from Asia, 283 (18.85%) from Africa and 159 (10.59%) from North America. A totalof 657 (43.95%) were senior doctors, 455 (30.43%) were nurses, 278 (18.60%) were junior doctors and 105 (7.04%) others (clinical pharmacists, physiotherapists and respiratory therapists). Most responders were male 844 (56.22%). The overall average stress level was 22 points on the PSS denoting moderate stress, while 508 (33.36%) respondents had a severe level of stress, 788 (51.87%) respondents had moderate level of stress and only 223 (14.61%) had mild stress. Fear of infection was the major concern for more than 80% of all the respondents, where 717 (58.5%) reported that fear of getting infected with COVID-19 increased their stress level while 290 (23.67%) reported that the fear of transmitting the infection to their families was the main cause of their stress. Other contributing factors to stress were, the increased duty hours, the increased work load and shortage of staff as reported by 89 (7.26%) while the lack of (personal protective equipments) PPEs accounted for stress in 68 (5.63%) respondents. Social media and triaging COVID patients were the least causes of staff stress as quoted by 39 (3.1%) and 38 (3.1%) respectively. Although 805 (53.67%) of respondents reported receiving psychological support from their facility, 689 (45.93%) reported not receiving any support. 302 (26.24%) received psychiatric counselling, 613 (53.26%) received phone calls and motivational emails/messages, 515 (44.74%) received phone calls for psychological support from their facility, 428 (37.19%) reported active listening to their concerns, 208 (18.07%) received psychological support from the community in the form of positive words and applauses. 444 (38.61%) reported the psychological support was somewhat effective, 371 (32.26%) said that it was very effective while 335 (29.19%) said that it was not effective at all. 829 (55.45%) tried some ways to decrease their stress like religious services, anxyolytics, exercise and watching movies Conclusion(s): Stress level was rated to be moderate to severe among intensive care HCWs during this pandemic, many risk factors were identified emphasizing the importance of psychological support during that unprecedented pandemic and adjusting different ways for mitigating such stress.	false
0	Sexually Transmitted Infection Diagnoses and Access to a Sexual Health Service Before and After the National Lockdown for COVID-19 in Melbourne, Australia. Background: We aimed to examine the impact of lockdown on sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses and access to a public sexual health service during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Melbourne, Australia., Methods: The operating hours of Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) remained the same during the lockdown. We examined the number of consultations and STIs at MSHC between January and June 2020 and stratified the data into prelockdown (February 3 to March 22), lockdown (March 23 to May 10), and postlockdown (May 11 to June 28), with 7 weeks in each period. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression models., Results: The total number of consultations dropped from 7818 in prelockdown to 4652 during lockdown (IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.62) but increased to 5347 in the postlockdown period (IRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.20). There was a 68% reduction in asymptomatic screening during lockdown (IRR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.30-0.35), but it gradually increased during the postlockdown period (IRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.46-1.74). Conditions with milder symptoms showed a marked reduction, including nongonococcal urethritis (IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72) and candidiasis (IRR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49-0.76), during lockdown compared with prelockdown. STIs with more marked symptoms did not change significantly, including pelvic inflammatory disease (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.61-1.47) and infectious syphilis (IRR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.73-1.77). There was no significant change in STI diagnoses during postlockdown compared with lockdown., Conclusions: The public appeared to be prioritizing their attendance for sexual health services based on the urgency of their clinical conditions. This suggests that the effectiveness of clinical services in detecting, treating, and preventing onward transmission of important symptomatic conditions is being mainly preserved despite large falls in absolute numbers of attendees.

The association of mortality with the early humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection within the first few days after onset of symptoms (DAOS) has not been thoroughly investigated partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive antibody testing methods. Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Factors related with delirium in patients admitted in ICU because of COVID-19 pneumonia. Introduction: During the months of March to May we have experienced in Spain theconsequences of the COVID 19 pandemic. Different factors can be related to theevolution of a pathology, both those of the pathology and the patient, as well asthose derived from the high number of cases in a short period of time. Below we intend to analyze the different factors that are related to the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia in our area. Objective(s): Describe the factors related to delirium in patients admitted in ICU due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): Descriptive study carried out in a polivalent ICU. All patients admitted because of pneumonia by COVID-19 during the pandemia period were included. It was considered that a patient presented delirium by the ICU medical teams' clinical diagnosis. Delirium treatment was confirmed and adequated together with a psychiatry team destinated to ICU. Statistics: Qualitative variables were expressed as percentages and were compared using the X2-test, quantitative were expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) and were compared using T-Student test. A logistic regression model with delirium as dependent variable was constructed. Result(s): 95 patients were admitted, 35.6% presented delirium during ICU admission and 16% at discharge to hospitalization plant. 66'3% of all patients were intubated. 100% received Kaletra, Hydroxicloroquine and Azithromycin as treatment, additionally, 40% received Tocilizumab, 34% Interferon and 58% corticoids. Table 1 describes clinical characteristics. Conclusion(s): The patients admitted at our ICU due to COVID-19 pneumonia presented a high delirium incidence. Different factors as intubation and mechanical ventilation were associated with its development, aswell as sedation and muscle relaxants. However, it should be noted the statistically significant association after adjusting by different confusion factors between delirium with mortality in ICU, nosocomial infection appearance and prone ventilation.	false
0	"Could the new COVID-19 mutant strain undermine vaccination efforts? A mathematical modelling approach for estimating the spread of the UK mutant strain using Ontario, Canada, as a case study. <h4>Background: </h4> Infections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens. <h4>Methods: </h4> and findings: We devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Our findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy-and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease."	false
0	Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can be partially shielded from UV radiation when in particles generated by sneezing or coughing: Numerical simulations. UV radiation can inactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, designing effective UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of UV intensities inside virus-containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS-CoV-2 and dried particles formed from respiratory droplets, respectively. In 1-, 5- and 9-microm diameter particles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 0%, 10% and 18% (respectively) of simulated virions are exposed to intensities less than 1/100th of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e., they are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light (simulating sunlight), where absorption is small, 0% and 11% of virions in 1- and 9-microm particles have exposures 1/100th those of individually exposed virions. Shielding is small to negligible in sub-micron particles. Results show that shielding of virions in a particle can be reduced by illuminating a particle either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in air for a time sufficient to rotate through enough orientations. Because highly UV-reflective paints and surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination and the intensities within particles, they appear likely to be useful for reducing shielding of virions embedded within particles.

0	Acute pulmonary embolism in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Introduction: COVID-19 patientstypically have a prothrombotic status and acute pulmonary embolism (PE) may be a cause of persistent hypoxemia or sudden death. However, the incidence of PE has not been well reported. Method(s): Prospective institutional database of critically ill adult mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, conducted between March 10 and April 20, 2020. Patients were eligible if they underwent a computed tomography pulmonary scanner angiography (CTPA), as part of the routine management in case of persistent hypoxemia or respiratory deterioration. The primary endpoint of this study was the occurrence of PE; the impact of standard thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily) or high-regimen thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4000 IU twice daily or therapeutic unfractioned heparin) on PE occurrence was also analyzed. Result(s): Of 42 mechanically ventilated COVID-19, 36 underwent CTPA after a median of 7 [4-9] days since ICU admission and 13 [10-16] days since the onset of symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients were diagnosed of PE, which was bilateral in 5 patients and localized in the right lung in 7 patients. Ten of the patients with PE (83%) and 11 of the other 24 patients (46%) received standard thromboprophylaxis (OR 3.57 [1.09- 13.47]; p=0.04). D-dimers on the day of CTPA had a predictive accuracy of 0.90 (95% CIs 0.78-1.00) for APE. Two patients with PE (17%) and 10 patients without PE (43%) died at ICU discharge (OR 0.28 [0.05- 1.35]; p=0.26). Conclusion(s): One third of COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients have a pulmonary embolism visible on CTPA. Optimal diagnostic and prophylaxis strategies need to be further assessed.	false
0	Lysosomal-Immune Axis Is Associated with COVID 19 Disease Severity: Insights from Patient Single Cell Data. SARS-COV-2 has become a leading cause of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide yet heterogeneity in disease morbidity remains a conundrum. In this study, we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data from 75076 cells sequenced from clinically staged COVID-19 patients using a network approach and identified lysosomal-immune axis as a factor significantly associated with disease severity. Our results suggest modulation of lysosomal-immune pathways may present a novel drug-targeting strategy to attenuate SARS-Cov-2 infections.	false
0	Evaluation of spike protein antigens for SARS-CoV-2 serology. <h4>Background: </h4> Spike protein domains are being used in various serology-based assays to detect prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there has been limited comparison of human antibody titers against various spike protein antigens among COVID-19 infected patients. <h4>Methods:</h4> We compared four spike proteins (RBD, S1, S2 and a stabilized spike trimer (ST)) representing commonly used antigens for their reactivity to human IgG antibodies using indirect ELISA in serum from COVID-19 patients and pre-2020 samples. ST ELISA was also compared against the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test. Further, we estimated time appropriate IgG and IgA seropositivity rates in COVID-19 patients using a panel of sera samples collected longitudinally from the day of onset of symptoms (DOS). <h4>Results:</h4> Among the four spike antigens tested, the ST demonstrated the highest sensitivity (86.2%; 95% CI: 77.8-91.7%), while all four antigens showed high specificity to COVID-19 sera (94.7-96.8%). 13.8% (13/94) of the samples did not show seroconversion in any of the four antigen-based assays. In a double-blinded head-to-head comparison, ST based IgG ELISA displayed a better sensitivity (87.5%, 95%CI: 76.4-93.8%) than the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA (67.9%, 95% CI: 54.8-78.6%). Further, in ST-based assays, we found 48% and 50% seroconversion in the first six days (from DOS) for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, which increased to 84% (IgG) and 85% (IgA) for samples collected ≥22 days DOS. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Comparison of spike antigens demonstrates that spike trimer protein is a superior option as an ELISA antigen for COVID-19 serology.	false
0	Human Monoclonal Antibodies: On the Menu of Targeted Therapeutics Against COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, has been a tragic disaster to people all over the world. As there is no specific drug for COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies are attracting more and more attention as one of the most effective means to combat the pandemic. Here, we introduced the etiological and serological characteristics of COVID-19, discussed the current stage of development of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and summarized the antigenic epitopes in the S glycoprotein, which may deepen the understanding of the profile of immune recognition and response against SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight for the design of effective vaccines and antibody-based therapies.	false

0	"COVID-19 Pandemic and its psychological impact on healthcare professionals in pediatric hematology and oncology ward. Background: There is a growing concern about psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and we established a mental health safety-net to support medical professionals not only working in frontline but also in pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) ward. Method(s): We performed a semi-structured interview and questionnaire survey during the state of emergency 2020. Result(s): We completed questionnaire surveys from 27 nurses, 18 physicians, 2 nursery nurses, and 5 therapists, respectively. We have successfully controlled nosocomial outbreak even in the midst of the pandemic and found that high confidence in infection control is a fundamental element to facilitate their willingness of working in AGMC, one of the Hyogo Prefectural tertiary infectious disease centers. In general, medical professionals were relatively resilient with a strong belief to overcome the current crisis, but are still under overwhelming anxiety in themselves, especially about being infected to become an asymptomatic carrier who might pass the virus to younger vulnerable patients. Discussion(s): Given that complete obedience of preventative principles such as ""avoiding 3 Cs"" (Closed spaces, Crowded places, Close-contact) is not always feasible inPHOward, it would be possible that the healthcare professionals will be under psychological pressure in the possible future epidemics. We suggest that leveraging an institutional care guideline to simultaneously promote self-care educational activities represents a promising strategic approach to mitigate the psychological problems in PHO ward."	false
0	Working conditions and health status of 6,317 front line public health workers across five provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Public health workers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and primary health care institutes (PHIs) were among the main workers who implemented prevention, control, and containment measures. However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD(S): Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. RESULT(S): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers). The majority (71.6%) made immense efforts in both field and non-field work. Nearly 20.0% have worked all night for more than 3 days, and 45.3% had worked throughout the Chinese New Year holiday. Three risk factors and two protective factors were found to be independently associated with all three health outcomes in our final multivariate models: working all night for >3 days (multivariate odds ratio [ORm]=1.67~1.75, p<0.001), concerns about infection at work (ORm=1.46~1.89, p<0.001), perceived troubles at work (ORm=1.10~1.28, p<0.001), initiating COVID-19 prevention work after January 23 (ORm=0.78~0.82, p=0.002~0.008), and ability to persist for > 1 month at the current work intensity (ORm=0.44~0.55, p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Chinese public health workers made immense efforts and personal sacrifices to control the COVID-19 epidemic and faced the risk of mental health problems. Efforts are needed to improve the working conditions and health status of public health workers and thus maintain their morale and effectiveness during the fight against COVID-19.	false
0	Serum Endocan Levels on Admission Are Associated With Worse Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study. Thrombotic and embolic complications in the cardiovascular system are evident and associated with worse prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Endothelial-specific molecule 1 (endocan) plays a role in vascular pathology. We hypothesized serum endocan levels on admission are associated with primary composite end point (mortality and intensive care unit hospitalization) in COVID-19 patients. Patients (n = 80) with laboratory, clinical, and radiological confirmed COVID-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. Ten milliliter of peripheral venous blood were drawn within 24 hours of admission to estimate serum endocan levels. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM). Patients with the primary composite end point had significantly higher serum endocan levels than patients without (852.2 +/- 522.7 vs 550.2 +/- 440.8 ng/L, respectively; P <.01). In the logistic regression analysis, only increased serum endocan levels and increase in age were independent predictors of the primary composite end point (P <.05). In the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, we found that a serum endocan level of 276.4 ng/L had a 97% sensitivity and 85% specificity for prediction of the primary composite end point. Baseline serum endocan levels may prove useful as a prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Antiviral efficacy of personal care formulations against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Background: Non-therapeutic interventions such as practicing good hand hygiene continue to be the mainstay of protection from SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging respiratory viruses. Method(s): We have evaluated a range of commercially available personal care products including soaps, handwash liquids and alcohol-based hand sanitizers for antiviral efficacy against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 using internationally accepted standardized protocols at user-relevant contact time-points and product dilutions. Result(s): All the tested products resulted in 3 to 4 log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titer. Conclusion(s): Our data re-affirms recommendations by global public health authorities that proper hand hygiene can reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load significantly which should likely limit spread of the contagion.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	SARS-COV-2 infection in a patient with Evans syndrome: a silent enemy or an ally?. Introduction. During the current outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the way to manage patients with autoimmune diseases remains elusive due to limited data available. Case report. We presented a case of a COVID-19 positive 20-year-old female with prior history of Evans syndrome. The patients remained asymptomatic even though she had been treated with immunosuppressants (prednisolone and azathioprine) together with romiplostim. Moreover, her course of infection was accompanied by thrombocytosis, although her platelet count was mostly below the reference range before the infection. The patient was monitored vigilantly, with special regard to platelet count and signs of thrombotic events. Conclusion. Platelet count monitoring and romiplostim administration should be performed more cautiously in chronic immune thrombocytopenic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ.

0	Secondary infection in mechanically ventilated, critically ill-patients with COVID-19. Introduction: Secondary infection in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is poorly understood. It is challenging to discriminate between isolated COVID-19 viral and extra bacterial or fungal infection and there is paucity of data, mainly in critically ill patients (1). We investigated the secondary infection rate in COVID-19 critically ill patients, risk factors for infection and mortality. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) of the Hospital Universitario La Paz (Madrid, Spain), a 1300-bed teaching hospital, between 16 March 2020 and 17 May 2020. In that period a total of 3002 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, and our unit had a total of 83 beds during the pandemic period. All patients that needed invasive mechanical ventilation were included. We recorded patient demographic data, microbiology data and incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay, including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial bacteremia (primary and secondary), according to Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. A total of 107 patients with a mean age 62.210.6 years were included. Incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay was 43.0% (46 patients), including nosocomial bacteremia (32.1%, 34 patients) and VAP (32.7%, 35 patients). Result(s): In univariate analysis, age and coronary arterial disease were related to development of secondary infection. Age remained as an independent predictor of secondary infection in multivariate analysis (OR 1.053, 95% CI 1.010-1.098, p = 0.015). Nor the use of systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab was related to secondary infection. Overall hospital mortality by 30 June 2020 was 68.2%. Mortality was higher in older patients (mean age 65.0 8.1 vs. 56.112.8 years, p = 0.001), in patients infected by antimicrobial resistant pathogens (94.1% vs. 63.3%, p = 0.012) and in case of secondary infection (82.6% vs. 57.3%, p = 0.006). Corticosteroids and tocilizumab administration was not related to mortality. Age and infection by antimicrobial resistant pathogens were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analyses (OR = 1.091, 95% CI 1.039-1.145, p < 0.001; and OR = 8.742, 95% CI 1.069-71.485, p = 0.043, respectively). The incidence of secondary infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients in our study is high (43.9%), higher than reported by Ferrando et al (4), with and incidence of respiratory bacterial infection and bacteremia of 27.15% and 26.24%, respectively, and Yang et al (5) (incidence of pneumonia and bacteremia of 11.5% and 2%, respectively). Feng et al declared an incidence of secondary infection of 34.4% in the more severe subgroup of COVID-19 patients (6). Our cohort includes only patients under invasive mechanical ventilation, what may explain partially these differences. An important finding of our study is the lack of relationship of corticosteroids and tocilizumab use and development of infections and mortality, in contrast to findings published by Sommers et al, with a lower mortality rate but a higher infection occurrence with tocilizumab use (10). Ferrando et al also showed no association between corticoids and tocilizumab use and mortality (4). To our knowledge, this is the first study that focus on secondary nosocomial infections in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our study has several limitations: the retrospective nature of the analysis; the lack of invasive modalities to help diagnose VAP (bronchoalveolar lavage) due to infection control measures; and the absence of data regarding antibiotic treatment since appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment affects mortality. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our data suggest that the incidence of secondary infection is very high in critically-ill patients with COVID-19. Infections by antimicrobial resistant pathogens may have a significant impact in prognosis. We cannot rule out that infections by resistant pathogens was simply a marker of severity. Further studies on larger populations are needed to investigate secondary infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Jobs, Housing, and Mask Wearing: Cross-Sectional Study of Risk Factors for COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Many studies have focused on the characteristics of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and clinical risk factors. This study reports the prevalence of COVID-19 in an asymptomatic population of a hospital service area (HSA) and identifies factors that affect exposure to the virus. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of COVID-19 in an HSA, identify factors that may increase or decrease the risk of infection, and analyze factors that increase the number of daily contacts. METHOD(S): This study surveyed 1694 patients between April 30 and May 13, 2020, about their work and living situations, income, behavior, sociodemographic characteristics, and prepandemic health characteristics. This data was linked to testing data for 454 of these patients, including polymerase chain reaction test results and two different serologic assays. Positivity rate was used to calculate approximate prevalence, hospitalization rate, and infection fatality rate (IFR). Survey data was used to analyze risk factors, including the number of contacts reported by study participants. The data was also used to identify factors increasing the number of daily contacts, such as mask wearing and living environment. RESULT(S): We found a positivity rate of 2.2%, a hospitalization rate of 1.2%, and an adjusted IFR of 0.55%. A higher number of daily contacts with adults and older adults increases the probability of becoming infected. Occupation, living in an apartment versus a house, and wearing a face mask outside work increased the number of daily contacts. CONCLUSION(S): Studying prevalence in an asymptomatic population revealed estimates of unreported COVID-19 cases. Occupational, living situation, and behavioral data about COVID-19-protective behaviors such as wearing a mask may aid in the identification of nonclinical factors affecting the number of daily contacts, which may increase SARS-CoV-2 exposure.Copyright ©Eline M van den Broek-Altenburg, Adam J Atherly, Sean A Diehl, Kelsey M Gleason, Victoria C Hart, Charles D MacLean, Daniel A Barkhuff, Mark A Levine, Jan K Carney.

0	Decline in functional status after ICU discharge of COVID-19 patients. Introduction: In December 2019, cases of COVID-19 infection were reported and this novel virus spread rapidly to touch every corner of the world within weeks. COVID-19 affects mainly the respiratory system and would result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring ICU admission and prolonged mechanical ventilation. For ICU survivors, recovery may be characterized by a marked compromise between physical and psychological health after ICU discharge which may decrease quality of life. Objective(s): The objective of our study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of post ICU physical impairment of COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A retrospective study was performed in the medical ICU of Jean Bernard hospital in Valenciennes, France, included all consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between Mars 11 and Mai 15, 2020. The study collected clinical features at admission, severity of illness, ICU course, and acute management procedures. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with physical declines. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 24.0. Result(s): A total of 77 patients were included: 52 male (67.5%), mean age, 64.67 +/- 11 years; mean BMI, 31.27 +/- 9.05 kg/m2; mean Charlson index, 3.03 +/- 1.99; mean SAPSII score, 36.11 +/- 10.33; mean SOFA score, 4.56 +/- 2.46; invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 57(74%) with median duration, 17[9-26.25] days; vasopressors, 45(72.7%); hydrocortisone, 23(29.9%); neuromuscular blockers agents, 46 (59.7%); ECMO, 4(5.1%); tracheostomy, 10(13%); median length of ICU stay, 17[6-26] days; mortality rate, 33.8%. Twenty-one (42%) of ICU survivors were transferred to rehabilitation ward with mean length of stay, 19.35 +/- 9.45 days. On the day of hospital discharge, 14(28%) patients kept persistent physical impairment. Univariate analysis identified several factors associated to rehabilitation needs after ICU stay: age, p 0.006; use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers agents with p value respectively 0.000 and 0.006; duration of IMV, p 0.006 and duration of ICU stay, p 0.000. In multivariate analysis two predictors were independently associated to rehabilitation needs: the age (OR, 1.104; 95%CI[1.00-1.22], p 0.051) and duration of ICU stay (OR, 1.11; 95%CI[1.01-1.22], p 0.023). Univariate analysis identified the age (p = 0.038), neuromuscular blockers agents (p = 0.009) and medical history of diabetes (p = 0.026) as factors associated with prolonged stay (>14 days) in rehabilitation ward. Conclusion(s): Critically ill patients who survive COVID-19 infection frequently experience important and long-lasting physical impairments. In fact, identified factors associated with persistent physical disabilities after ICU discharge may offer physicians the opportunity to facilitate adequate screening and to develop preventive measures to improve health-related quality of life of critical illness survivors.	false
0	First results of the COVID-19 in MS global data sharing initiative suggest anti-CD20 DMTS are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic amplifies, efforts to minimise the risk on vulnerable people are essential. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be a vulnerable group due to the high proportion taking long-term immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Studies from Italy and France suggest older age, higher disability and progressive MS are associated with severe COVID-19, yet there remains uncertainty around the influence of DMTs. Objective(s): Given the many approved MS DMTs and the relatively low frequency of COVID-19 in MS patients per country, international data sharing is desirable to examine the impact of DMTs on COVID-19 severity. Here, we present the first results of the COVID-19 in MS global data sharing initiative of the MS International Federation and MS Data Alliance and many other data partners to inform MS clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Clinician-reported data from 21 countries were aggregated into a dataset of 1540 patients. Characteristics of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), need for artificial ventilation, and death, were assessed in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection using log-binomial regression. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated adjusting for age, sex, MS type, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Result(s): Of 1540 patients, 476 (30.9%) with suspected and 776 (50.4%) with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Older age, progressive MS and higher EDSS were associated with higher frequencies of severe outcomes. Anti-CD20 DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab, were positively associated with hospital admission (aPRs=1.19 & 1.58), ICU admission (aPRs=3.53 & 4.12), and the need for artificial ventilation (aPRs=3.17 & 7.27) compared to dimethyl fumarate. Higher frequencies of all three outcomes were associated with combined anti-CD20 DMT use compared to all other DMTs (hospitalisation aPR=1.49; ICU aPR=2.55; ventilation aPR=3.05) and compared to natalizumab (hospitalisation aPR=1.99; ICU aPR=2.39; ventilation aPR=2.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases and upon exclusion of each contributing data source in turn. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusion(s): This study used the largest federated international cohort of people with MS and COVID19 currently available. We demonstrate a consistent association of anti-CD20 DMTs with hospitalisation, ICU admission and use of artificial ventilation suggesting their use among MS patients at risk for COVID-19 exposure may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. To address study limitations, further research incorporating comorbidities, smoking and body mass index is required. Alternative study designs are needed to address questions on COVID-19 susceptibility among people with MS.	false
0	Role of multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. The management of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be difficult due to the need for dedicated in-hospital pathways, protective measures for healthcare professionals and isolated beds of intensive care, particularly in areas overwhelmed by wide viral spread. Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.

0	"RT-PCR Combined with CT Examination in the Diagnosis and Prognosis Evaluation of COVID-19 Patients in Fangcang Hospital: A Case Series. Rationale: Currently, the ""gold standard"" is real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the viral DNA for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, early reports of test performance in the Wuhan outbreak showed variable sensitivities. Therefore, the simple use of RT-PCR as a discharge standard for COVID-19 patients may be risky. Early discussions suggested that CT should be the preferred modality for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the use of CT for COVID-19 discharge is controversial. In the Fangcang hospital, we performed multiple nucleic acid tests and chest CT examinations in all patients. For discharged patients, we performed multiple nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans on the basis of discharge standards to minimize the incidence of false negatives in nucleic acid tests., Patient Concerns: Two 42-year-old male patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were treated in the Fangcang Hospital According to the treatment, one patient was cured and discharged, while the other patient was sent to a higher-level hospital for further treatment., Diagnoses: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of the viral DNA for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection., Interventions: The patients received Chinese medicine and antiviral treatment in the Fangcang Hospital., Outcomes: At follow-up, both patients were cured after treatment and returned to normal life after 2 weeks of home isolation and a negative nucleic acid test., Lessons: The use of nucleic acid testing combined with chest CT examination can quickly diagnose patients with COVID-19 infection and evaluate their treatment in the Fangcang Hospital.

0	The measles outbreak in Israel in 2018-19: lessons for COVID-19 pandemic. During 2018-2019 Israel saw some 4300 measles cases in a country-wide epidemic. Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making. In parallel to proper use of COVID-19 vaccines, when available, a 'social vaccine' is crucial as well as preparedness and response according to public health principles.	false
0	IgA autoantibodies target pulmonary surfactant in patients with severe COVID-19. Complications affecting the lung are hallmarks of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant. Our data suggest that IgA-driven autoimmunity against surfactant may result in disease progression of COVID-19.	false
0	Upper respiratory viral load in asymptomatic individuals and mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Background Asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have viable viral loads and have been linked to several transmission cases. However, data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking. We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Methods Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID-19 in South Korea. The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire-based survey. Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the E, RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40 for determining positivity. Results In 213 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 (19%) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission; of them, 39 (95%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing after a median 13 days. In 172 symptomatic patients, 144 (84%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Twenty-one (54%) asymptomatic individuals and 92 (64%) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up. Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E (31.15 vs 31.43; p>0.99), RdRp (32.26 vs 32.93; p=0.92) and N (33.05 vs 33.28; p>0.99) genes. Conclusion Approximately one-fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic, and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients. A large proportion of mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 or asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 showed persistent positive upper respiratory RT-PCR results at follow-up.	false
0	Predictive factors for impaired mental health among medical students during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco. The COVID-19 pandemic has great consequences on mental health. We aimed to assess medical students' psychological condition and influencing factors as a baseline evidence for interventions promoting their mental wellbeing. We conducted an online survey from April 8 to April 18, 2020 to examine the mental health of medical students by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, seven-item Insomnia Severity Index, and six-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Five hundred forty-nine students completed the survey; 341 (62.3%), 410 (74.6%), 344 (62.6%), and 379 (69%) reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Female students, living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations, more than 25 days confinement, psychiatric consult history, and being in a preclinical level of studies had higher median scores and severe symptom levels. Multivariable logistic regression showed female gender as a risk factor for severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.653; 95% CI: 1.020-2.679; P = 0.042), depression (OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.435-3.271; P < 0.001), insomnia (OR: 1.830; 95% CI: 1.176-2.847; P = 0.007), and distress (OR: 1.994; 95% CI: 1.338-2.972; P = 0.001); preclinical level of enrollment as a risk factor for depression (OR: 0.679; 95% CI: 0.521-0.885; P = 0.004), insomnia (OR: 0.720; 95% CI: 0.545-0.949; P = 0.02), and distress (OR: 0.650; 95% CI: 0.499-0.847; P = 0.001), whereas living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations was a risk factor for severe anxiety (OR: 1.628; 95% CI: 1.090-2.432; P = 0.017) and depression (OR: 1.438; 95% CI: 1.002-2.097; P = 0.05). Currently, medical students experience high levels of mental health symptoms, especially female students, those at a preclinical level and living in regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Screening for mental health issues, psychological support, and long-term follow-up could alleviate the burden and protect future physicians.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	false
0	Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in caregivers of children tested for COVID-19 in the acute phase of the Italian outbreak. BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 pandemic pointed out new burdens for researchers on mental health and that evidence-based (EB) studies on vulnerable populations are timely needed. The present paper aims at analysing the impact of suspicious of SARS-COV-2 infection in a cohort of parents presented at 3 major hospitals (spread between north and center of Italy) during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1., METHODS: Participants of the present cross-sectional, multicenter study were parental couples of children suspected to have COVID-19 who underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swabbing. All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively., OUTCOMES: Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers., INTERPRETATION: This study identified a mental health strain represented by parenting a child who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further EB research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and related psychiatric symptoms in caregivers of COVID-19 infected children during the next phases of the pandemic.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has left dramatic footprints on human health and economy. Cancer, whilst not an infective disease, is prevalent in epidemic proportions and cannot be pretermitted due to the impact of COVID-19. As we emanate from the second national lockdown in the UK with mixed feelings of hope and despair-due to vaccination and new COVID-19 variant, respectively-we reflect on the impact of the first wave on the provision on diagnosis and management of with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers. This review provides a critical analysis of available literature on COVID-19 and its impact on cancer management in general and that of UGI cancers in particular.	false
0	Decreased Stroke Presentation Rates at a Comprehensive Stroke Center during COVID-19. We reviewed stroke care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic at our stroke center and provincial telestroke system. We counted referrals to our prevention clinic, code strokes, thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomies, and activations of a provincial telestroke system from February to April of 2017-2020. In April 2020, there was 28% reduction in prevention clinic referrals, 32% reduction in code strokes, and 26% reduction in telestroke activations compared to prior years. Thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy rates remained constant. Fewer patients received stroke services across the spectrum from prevention, acute care to telestroke care in Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Quantifying the transmission advantage associated with N501Y substitution of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom: An early data-driven analysis. The emerging N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2, which becomes prevalent in the UK rapidly, is one of the major challenges of COVID-19 control. To explore the transmission advantage, we estimate that the N501Y substitution increases the infectivity by 52% (95%CI: 46, 58) in terms of the reproduction number.

0	Blood biochemical parameters for assessment of COVID-19 in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects: a cross-sectional study. This study aims to identify blood biomarkers for rapidly predicting progression and severity assessment of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetic (DM) and non-DM (NDM) patients. Among 211 hospitalized patients suspected of COVID-19, 98 were confirmed COVID-19 by rRT-PCR. The COVID-19 positive group contained 58 DM and 40 NDM patients with total death 9 of which 7 were males and 6 were DM, indicating males and DM individuals as more susceptible to COVID-19. Blood biomarkers notably serum ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, ALT, troponin I, and Hb1Ac were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in COVID-19 patients. Ferritin and HbA1c levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in DM than NDM COVID-19 patients. The present study suggests that ferritin and HbA1c levels for DM patients, and ferritin, D-dimer, ALT for NDM patients could be routinely used as biomarkers for progression and severity assessment of COVID-19. CRP and Troponin-I could be the predictor only for poor prognosis of COVID-19.	false
0	Global absence and targeting of protective immune states in severe COVID-19. While SARS-CoV-2 infection has pleiotropic and systemic effects in some patients1-3, many others experience milder symptoms. We sought a holistic understanding of the severe/mild distinction in COVID-19 pathology, and its origins. We performed a whole-blood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression3 across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies that functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells, by engaging conserved signaling circuits that dampen cellular responses to interferons. Overzealous antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many COVID-19 patients and perhaps in other viral infections and this study defines targets for immunotherapies in severe patients to re-engage viral defense.	false
0	Exploring salivary diagnostics in COVID-19: a scoping review and research suggestions. INTRODUCTION: Molecular diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection characteristically involves the sampling of the throat or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, these procedures are invasive, require necessary skills for sample collection, cause patient discomfort, and are non-conducive for extensive scale testing. Saliva is increasingly being suggested as an alternate diagnostic sample in SARS-CoV-2 infection., OBJECTIVES: This scoping review was done with the objective of exploring the evidence on the role of saliva as an alternate diagnostic sample in SARS-CoV-2 condition., METHODS: Thorough search of the literature in major databases was undertaken in June 2020 using free text and MESH terms, followed by PRISMA to identify 17 studies for data extraction., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was summarised for study characteristics, salivary sampling characteristics, viral load, and longevity of virus in saliva. The literature supports that saliva offers a simple sample collection method compared to technique-sensitive NPS and has the advantage of point-of-care testing for initial screening in community or hospital-based set-up. The additional highlights of this review are heterogeneity in the current literature and the gaps in methodology. Therefore, a robust study design to generate higher levels of evidence has been proposed.	false
0	"Recovery scenario and immunity in COVID-19 disease: A new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection. Background: The recent ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), still is an unsolved problem with a growing rate of infected cases and mortality worldwide. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mostly causes a respiratory illness. Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection., Aim of Review: To answer the questions regarding ""the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases"" or ""the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection"" we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection., Key Scientific Concepts of Review: In this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category. This classification may help to distribute resources more meticulously to determine: who needs to be serologically tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, what percentage of the population is immune to the virus, and who needs to be vaccinated.

0	Covid-19 in end-stage renal disease patients with renal replacement therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis. <h4>Introduction</h4> The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, showed various prevalence and case-fatality rates (CFR) among patients with different pre-existing chronic conditions. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was no systematic study on the infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients who are on RRT. <h4>Methods</h4> We searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT. The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points. <h4>Results</h4> Of 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with RRT was 3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average prevalence. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was 18.06% (95%CI 14.09– 22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98%. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This meta-analysis suggested high COVID-19 prevalence and CFR in ESRD patients with RRT. ESRD patients with RRT should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths. <h4>Author summary</h4> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was associated with increasing severity and mortality of COVID-19. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients were at the terminal stage of CKD and had reduced immune function due to uremia. Additionally, ESRD patients with kidney transplantation had a diminished immune system from immunosuppressive agents. Kidneys might be the secondary target of SARS-CoV-2 after the respiratory tract regardless of the previous history of kidney disease, preferably the glomerulus, which was associated with the richness of some specific protein-coding genes in the kidney. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy was approximately 22 times of the referencing global average prevalence. The overall estimated case fatality rate of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy was approximately 3.6 times the global average. ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy had high COVID-19 prevalence and case fatality rate. We suggested that ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.	false
0	Screening and development of monoclonal antibodies for identification of ferret T follicular helper cells. The ferret is a key animal model for investigating the pathogenicity and transmissibility of important human viruses, and for the pre-clinical assessment of vaccines. However, relatively little is known about the ferret immune system, due in part to a paucity of ferret-reactive reagents. In particular, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are critical in the generation of effective humoral responses in humans, mice and other animal models but to date it has not been possible to identify Tfh in ferrets. Here, we describe the screening and development of ferret-reactive BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. We found two commercial anti-BCL6 antibodies (clone K112-91 and clone IG191E/A8) had cross-reactivity with lymph node cells from influenza-infected ferrets. We next developed two murine monoclonal antibodies against ferret CXCR5 (clone feX5-C05) and PD-1 (clone fePD-CL1) using a single B cell PCR-based method. We were able to clearly identify Tfh cells in lymph nodes from influenza infected ferrets using these antibodies. The development of ferret Tfh marker antibodies and the identification of ferret Tfh cells will assist the evaluation of vaccine-induced Tfh responses in the ferret model and the design of novel vaccines against the infection of influenza and other viruses, including SARS-CoV2.	false
0	COVID-19 pandemic models revisited with a new proposal: Plenty of epidemiological models outcast the simple population dynamics solution. We have put an effort to estimate the number of publications related to the modelling aspect of the corona pandemic through the web search with the corona associated keywords. The survey reveals that plenty of epidemiological models outcast the simple population dynamics solution. Most of the future predictions based on these epidemiological models are highly unreliable because of the complexity of the dynamical equations and the poor knowledge of realistic values of the model parameters. The incidence time series of top ten corona infected countries are erratic and sparse. But in comparison, the incidence and disease fitness relationships are uniform and concave upward in nature. These simple profiles with the acceleration curves have fundamental implications in understanding the instinctive dynamics of the corona pandemic. We propose a simple population dynamics solution based on the incidence-fitness relationship in predicting that a plateau or steady state of SARS-CoV-2 will be reached using the basic concept of geometry.

Dependable, specific and rapid diagnostic methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) detection are needed to promote public health interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we have established an entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2 known as RdRp-COVID which as the target for SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the construction of the sensors, DNA tetrahedron (DT) is modified on the surface of the electrode to furnish robust and programmable scaffolds materials, upon which target DNA-participated entropy-driven amplified reaction is efficiently conducted to link the Ru (bpy)32+ modified S3 to the linear ssDNA at the vertex of the tetrahedron and eventually present an ""ECL on"" state. The rigid tetrahedral structure of the DT probe enhances the ECL intensity and avoids the cross-reactivity between single-stranded DNA, thus increasing the sensitivity of the assays. The enzyme-free entropy-driven reaction prevents the use of expensive enzyme reagents and facilitates the realization of large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our DT-based ECL sensor has demonstrated significant specificity and high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.67 fM. Additionally, our operational method has achieved the detection of RdRp-COVID in human serum samples, which supplies a reliable and feasible sensing platform for the clinical bioanalysis.

0	Incidence and characterization of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: A multicenter Italian experience. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies reported a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but detailed data about clinical characteristics, risk factors of these patients and prognostic role of PE are still lacking. We aim to evaluate the occurrence of pulmonary embolism among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to describe their risk factors, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital clinical outcomes., METHODS: This is a multicenter Italian study including 333 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to seven hospitals from February 22 to May 15, 2020. All the patients underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE detection. In particular, CTPA was performed in case of inadequate response to high-flow oxygen therapy (Fi02>=0.4 to maintain Sp02>=92%), elevated D-dimer (>0.5mug/mL), or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also analyzed., RESULTS: Among 333 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and undergoing CTPA, PE was detected in 109 (33%) cases. At CTPA, subsegmental, segmental, lobar and central thrombi were detected in 31 (29%), 50 (46%), 20 (18%) and 8 (7%) cases, respectively. In-hospital death occurred in 29 (27%) patients in the PE-group and in 47 (21%) patients in the non-PE group (p = 0.25). Patients in PE-group had a low rate of traditional risk factors and deep vein thrombosis was detected in 29% of patients undergoing compression ultrasonography. In 71% of cases with documented PE, the thrombotic lesions were located in the correspondence of parenchymal consolidation areas., CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low rate of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, PE is present in about 1 out 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia undergoing CTPA for inadequate response to oxygen therapy, elevated D-dimer level, or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. In most of the cases, the thromboses were located distally in the pulmonary tree and were mainly confined within pneumonia areas.	false
0	Evaluating the Impact of Intervention Strategies on the First Wave and Predicting the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Thailand: A Mathematical Modeling Study. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide. This study aimed to assess and predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Thailand, including the preparation and evaluation of intervention strategies. An SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model was implemented with model parameters estimated using the Bayesian approach. The model's projections showed that the highest daily reported incidence of COVID-19 would be approximately 140 cases (95% credible interval, CrI: 83-170 cases) by the end of March 2020. After Thailand declared an emergency decree, the numbers of new cases and case fatalities decreased, with no new imported cases. According to the model's predictions, the incidence would be zero at the end of June if non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were strictly and widely implemented. These stringent NPIs reduced the effective reproductive number (Rt) to 0.73 per day (95% CrI: 0.53-0.93) during April and May. Sensitivity analysis showed that contact rate, hand washing, and face mask wearing effectiveness were the parameters that most influenced the number of reported daily new cases. Our evaluation shows that Thailand's intervention strategies have been highly effective in mitigating disease propagation. Continuing with these strict disease prevention behaviors could minimize the risk of a new COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.	false
0	Factors associated with survival in older patients affected by COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study. AIM: Mortality is high in Coronavirus disease 2019 patients with pre-existing comorbidities and advanced age. Associated complications have added to the negative prognosis. Nevertheless, many have fully recovered, even among the most fragile. Factors associated with their survival was investigated., METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged >=90 years admitted for COVID-19 to the Internal Medicine wards of two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy., RESULTS: Among 34 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 33 (97.1%) had respiratory failure. Eighteen patients (52.9%) survived and 16 (47.1%) died during hospital stay. Survivors compared to deceased had a significantly longer hospitalization (19 vs. 10 days respectively; p = 0.02), a better PaO2:FiO2 ratio (241 vs. 171 respectively; p = 0.003), higher lymphocyte counts (p = 0.01) and lower serum LDH levels (p < 0.001) at admission. At multivariate analysis only higher PaO2:FiO2 was associated with survival (OR 1.06 [95%CI 1.0-1.03]; p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in event-free survival between patients treated or not with LMWH (p < 0.0001) and between those treated or not with beta-blockers (p = 0.008). Cox regression, performed in the subgroup of patients who received LMWH, did not show significant difference for sex (HR 2.7 [95% CI 0.53-14.3], p = 0.23), CCI (HR 0.7 [95% CI 0.37-1.45], p = 0.38), PaO2:FiO2 ratio (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97-1.0], p = 0.07), corticosteroid therapy (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.22-4.5], p = 0.99) and beta-blocker therapy (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.56-14,7], p = 0.21)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher mortality in elderly, treatment with LMWH and betablockers might be associated with better survival. Dedicated studies are required to confirm our result. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false

Background: Since the onset of the COVID-19 in China, forecasting and projections of the epidemic based on epidemiological models have been in the centre stage. Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government. Methods: Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R-0, and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. ""R-0"" package in R software was used to estimate these statistics. Results: The basic reproduction number (R-0) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2-8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9-29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate. Conclusion: The study estimated a baseline R-0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically."	false

0	Forecasting hospital demand in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 pandemic and estimates of lockdown-induced 2nd waves. We present a forecasting model aim to predict hospital occupancy in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our SEIRD type model features asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with detailed hospital dynamics. We model explicitly branching probabilities and non-exponential residence times in each latent and infected compartments. Using both hospital admittance confirmed cases and deaths, we infer the contact rate and the initial conditions of the dynamical system, considering breakpoints to model lockdown interventions and the increase in effective population size due to lockdown relaxation. The latter features let us model lockdown-induced 2nd waves. Our Bayesian approach allows us to produce timely probabilistic forecasts of hospital demand. We have applied the model to analyze more than 70 metropolitan areas and 32 states in Mexico.	false
0	Low-Dose Ad26.COV2.S Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge in Rhesus Macaques. We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1×10 11 , 5×10 10 , 1.125×10 10 , or 2×10 9 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as low as 2×10 9 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125×10 10 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.	false
0	Electrocardiographic Changes in Children with Multisystem Inflammation Associated with COVID-19: Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019. Objective: To analyze findings and trends on serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease taken during the course of illness and at follow-up. Study design: We included all children presenting with MIS-C at a single center with 3 or more ECGs taken during the course of their illness. We measured ECG intervals (PR, QRSd, and QTc) and amplitudes (R-, S-, and T-waves) on each ECG and documented any arrhythmias and ST-segment changes. Result(s): A majority of children (n = 42, 67%) showed ECG changes. The most common findings were low QRS amplitudes and transient T-wave inversion. ST changes were uncommon and included ST-segment elevation consistent with pericarditis in 1 child and acute coronary ischemia in 1 child. Arrhythmias were seen in 13 children (21%) but were benign with the exception of 1 child who was compromised by an atrial tachycardia requiring support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No children were found to have high-grade atrioventricular block. Conclusion(s): MIS-C is associated with electrocardiographic changes over the course of the illness, with low amplitude ECGs on presentation, followed by transient T-wave inversion, particularly in the precordial leads. There was a low prevalence of ST-segment changes and tachyarrhythmias.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Thirty-day mortality of patients with hip fracture during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Timely intervention in hip fracture is essential to decrease the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, limitations of the resources, risk of disease transmission and redirection of medical attention to a more severe infective health problem during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period have affected the quality of care even in a surgical emergency., AIM: To compare the 30-d mortality rate and complications of hip fracture patients treated during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times., METHODS: The search of electronic databases on 1st August 2020 revealed 45 studies related to mortality of hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. After careful screening, eight studies were eligible for quantitative and qualitative analysis of data., RESULTS: The pooled data of eight studies (n = 1586) revealed no significant difference in 30-d mortality rate between the hip fracture patients treated during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods [9.63% vs 6.33%; odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95%CI, 0.33, 1.17; P = 0.14]. Even the 30-d mortality rate was not different between COVID-19 non-infected patients who were treated during the pandemic time, and all hip fracture patients treated during the pre-pandemic period (OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.61, 1.75; P = 0.91). A significant difference in mortality rate was observed between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients (OR, 6.99; 95%CI, 3.45, 14.16; P < 0.00001). There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay (OR, -1.52, 95%CI, -3.85, 0.81; P = 0.20), overall complications (OR, 1.62; P = 0.15) and incidence of pulmonary complications (OR, 1.46; P = 0.38) in these two-time frames. Nevertheless, the preoperative morbidity was more severe, and there was less use of general anesthesia during the pandemic time., CONCLUSION: There was no difference in 30-d mortality rate between hip fracture patients treated during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. However, the mortality risk was higher in COVID-19 positive patients compared to COVID-19 negative patients. There was no difference in time to surgery, complications and hospitalization time between these two time periods. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

0	SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 is susceptible to neutralizing antibodies elicited by ancestral Spike vaccines. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Molecular Imaging: A Systematic Review of Incidental Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia on PET Studies. There have been several reports of the incidental detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) studies, which represent the potential role of molecular imaging in the detection and management of coronavirus disease 2019. Here, we systematically review the value of PET/CT in this setting. We conducted a systematic search on June 23, 2020, for PET studies with findings suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019. Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were used. Patients with at least one PET/CT imaging evaluation were included in the study. Fifty-two patients in 30 publications with a mean age of 60 +/- 12.74 (age range; 27-87) were included in this study, of which 28 (53.8%) were male, and 19 (36.5%) were female. In 5 (9.7%) patients, gender was not reported. PET/CT was performed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for 48 (92.3%), 18F-choline for 3 (5.8%), and 68Ga-PSMA for 1 (1.9%) patients. The mean SUV max of pulmonary lesions with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was 4.9 +/- 2.3. Moreover, 39 (75%) cases had an underlying malignancy, including 18 different type of primary cancers and 6 (11.5%) patients with metastatic disease. The most common pulmonary findings in PET/CT were bilateral hypermetabolic ground-glass opacities in 39 (75%), consolidation in 18 (34.6%), and interlobular thickening in 4 (7.6%). In addition, mediastinal 14 (27%) and hilar 10 (19.2%) lymph node involvement with increased metabolic activity was frequently identified. Early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia is not only crucial for both appropriate patient management but also helps to ensure appropriate postexposure precautions are implemented for the department and hospital staff and those who have been in contact with the patient.

0	Possible involvement of Syndecan-1 in the state of COVID-19 related to endothelial injury. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with microvascular endothelial injury. Here, we report that syndecan-1, a component of endothelial glycocalyx, may reflect the disease state of COVID-19 related to endothelial injury., CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with COVID-19 was transferred to the intensive care unit of our hospital. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities, which was diagnosed as acute respiratory syndrome. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio gradually increased from 158 on hospitalization to 300 on Day 11, on which day the ventilator was withdrawn. However, serum syndecan-1 (SDC-1) level gradually decreased from 400.5 ng/ml at hospitalization to 165.1 ng/ml on Day 5. On Day 6, serum SDC-1 level increased to 612.9 ng/ml owing to a systemic thrombosis with an increase in D-dimer. Serum SDC-1 level then decreased until 206.0 ng/ml on Day 11 after a decrease in D-dimer. The patient was transferred to another hospital on Day 21 after hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, changes in serum SDC-1 level closely reflected the change in disease condition in a patient with COVID-19. Serum SDC-1 may be a useful biomarker for monitoring the disease state of critically ill patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Epidemiology of COVID-19 ICU admissions-ethnicity and deprivation. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 infection, originating from Wuhan, China is the underlying cause of COVID-19 disease [1]. The first known patient with COVID-19 disease was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) at the Royal Gwent Hospital (RGH), Newport, Wales on the 9th March. Objective(s): In this case-series analysis we describe the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19, focusing on the interplay between ethnicity and social deprivation, by using data from the first 60 days at the RGH ICU. Method(s): Our prospective service evaluation recorded anonymised data on patient age; sex; BMI; postcode; ethnicity; Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) score [2]; need for any assistance with daily activities; APACHE II score; time from hospital admission to ICU, and ICU mortality. Background data on ethnicity for the hospital catchment area was obtained from the UK Census data 2011 (Office for National Statistics). Result(s): The Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population, while being only 5% of the background population, represented 35% of ICU COVID-19 admissions (18 of 52) and 35% of deaths (6 of 17). Within the BAME group, 72% (13 of 18) of patients were from geographical areas representing the 20% most deprived (lowest quintile) in Wales, versus 27% of Caucasians (9 of 33). When looking at deaths by ethnicity, more occurred within the lowest deprivation quintile in the BAME group (4 of 6 deaths) compared to the Caucasian group (3 of 11). Conclusion(s): We found that patients from the BAME group are at significantly higher risk of ICU admission and death from COVID-19, despite an overwhelming Caucasian background population (95%). We observed a striking interaction between deprivation and ethnicity, which may be multifactorial, including greater prevalence of comorbidities; increased community spread; genetic polymorphisms; or other unidentified factors [3-5]. These factors need further investigation and evaluation.	false

0	Switched and unswitched memory B cells detected during SARS-CoV-2 convalescence correlate with limited symptom duration. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the pandemic human respiratory illness COVID-19, is a global health emergency. While severe acute disease has been linked to an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, we sought to identify B cell responses that correlated with positive clinical outcomes in convalescent patients. We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects. Memory B cell subsets in convalescent subjects were composed of classical CD24+ class-switched memory B cells, but also activated CD24-negative and natural unswitched CD27+ IgD+ IgM+ subsets. Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in most seropositive subjects. IgM+ memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over 3 months. Our findings suggest that the frequency of memory B cells is a critical indicator of disease resolution, and that IgM+ memory B cells may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 immunity.	false
0	An indirect method to monitor the fraction of people ever infected with COVID-19: An application to the United States. The number of COVID-19 infections is key for accurately monitoring the pandemics. However, due to differential testing policies, asymptomatic individuals and limited large-scale testing availability, it is challenging to detect all cases. Seroprevalence studies aim to address this gap by retrospectively assessing the number of infections, but they can be expensive and time-intensive, limiting their use to specific population subgroups. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR) in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because they count with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. We obtain that the IFR varies from 1.25% (0.39-2.16%, 90% CI) in Florida, the most aged population, to 0.69% in Utah (0.21-1.30%, 90% CI), the youngest population. By September 8, 2020, we estimate that at least five states have already a fraction of people ever infected between 10% and 20% (New Jersey, New York, Massachussets, Connecticut, and District of Columbia). The state with the highest estimated fraction of people ever infected is New Jersey with 17.3% (10.0, 55.8, 90% CI). Moreover, our results indicate that with a probability of 90 percent the fraction of detected people among the ever infected since the beginning of the epidemic has been less than 50% in 15 out of the 20 states analyzed in this paper. Our approach can be a valuable tool that complements seroprevalence studies and indicates how efficient have testing policies been since the beginning of the outbreak.	false

0	Effect of timing of implementation of containment measures on Covid-19 epidemic. The case of the first wave in Italy. There is evidence that adoption of non-pharmaceutical containment measures (NPMs) may have had a major impact on Covid-19 epidemic dynamics, and mitigated its effect on healthcare system. Optimal timing of implementation of these measures however is not known. In Italy, a national lockdown was decided on March 11th 2020 and ended 4th of May. At that time, cumulative incidence (CI) was different in Italian regions which ranged from <5 cases/100,000 to >11 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In this paper, we aim to evaluate how level of incidence in different regions at the time of implementation of NPMs affected CI and had an impact on the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rates. We used regional daily new COVID-19 diagnosed cases as well number of people hospitalized in ICU and number of deaths for period February 24-May 11 from all the 19 Italian regions and two autonomous provinces. For each region we calculated: temporal daily trend of cumulative cases of Covid-19/100,000 inhabitants, daily trend of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rate at the end of period. We found that the epidemic curves show similar trends for all regions and all tend to flatten between 11-32 days. However, after 2 months, regions with lower CI at lockdown remained at substantially lower CI (<265 cases/100,000), had a peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU which did not exceed 79.4% and a mortality<0.27/1,000. On the other hand, in regions with higher incidence at lockdown, CI reached 382-921 cases/100,000, the peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU and mortality rate reached 270%, and 1.5/1,000, respectively. Our data suggests that level of CI at the moment of lockdown is important to control the subsequent spread of infection so NPMs should be adopted very early during the course of Covid-19 epidemic, in order to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and to reduce related mortality.	false
0	Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 pandemic among adult population in Sidama Regional State, Southern Ethiopia: A community based cross-sectional study. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 incidence is increasing and different measures have been adopted to control the spread of the pandemic in Ethiopia. Among these measures, enhancing the knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices of prevention measures about the disease is a basic strategy to control it. However, community compliance to control measures is largely dependent on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: To assess the current level of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic and predictors among the rural dwellers in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia; 2020., METHODS: This community-based prospective cross-sectional study was carried out from May 1-30, 2020 on a sample of 1,278 adult populations in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to choice the study participants. The data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. We have entered data using Epi data version 3.1 and all analyses were done using SPSS version 25. KAPs scores of study participants based on their independent variables were compared using Chi-square test, t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as required. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with KAP. The important assumptions of the logistic regression model were checked to be satisfied. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the existence and strength of associations., RESULTS: From a total of 1,214 study participants, the overall attained knowledge, attitude and practice score about COVID-19 were 90%, 82.4% and 65%, respectively. Among these, 43.9%, 37.5%, and 24.4% of the study participants had demonstrated good knowledge, high attitude and proper practice, respectively. The mean knowledge scores were significantly different between sex, categories of marital status, educational levels, main occupation, and the monthly income quintiles of the study participants (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean attitude scores significantly varied across educational levels, main occupations and marital status (p<0.05). Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, main occupation of the government employees, education level of diploma and above, highest and second highest wealth rank were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention and control practice., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of study participants had showed good knowledge and optimistic attitude toward COVID-19. But, the level of practice lower than that expected to maximize effective control measures. Further public education interventions and community sensitization campaigns are required for rural adult population in the Sidama regional state, Ethiopia.	false
0	COVID-19 and anxiety in ophtalmologists. Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety in ophthalmologists during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) working in respiratory triage and outpatient ophthalmology consultation at the Hospital Central Militar in Mexico City. Material(s) and Method(s): Observational, cross-sectional, descriptive and prospective study, in which a descriptive survey was applied via internet evaluating two anxiety scales (Hamilton scale and generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7) scale). Result(s): Thirty-one subjects responded, 17 (54.84%) female and 14 (45.16%) male. Minimum age was 25 years and maximum age was 49 years, with an average age of 34.5 years.The survey consisted of 24 questions, of which 21 were obtained from both anxiety scales (Hamilton + GAD-7) and the remaining three were of epidemiological interest. By rating both scales separately, we observed an average score of 5.16 for the GAD-7 scale and of 8.45 for the Hamilton scale, reflecting a minimal group anxiety. Using the GAD-7 scale, we observed an anxiety prevalence of 48% (15 physicians). Of the diagnosed cases, 9 (60%) met a score listed as mild anxiety, 5 (53%) as moderate and 1 (7%) as severe. On the Hamilton scale, the prevalence was of 83% (26 physicians). Of the diagnosed cases, 23 (88%) had minimal anxiety, 2 (8%) had minimal-moderate anxiety and 1 (4%) had severe anxiety. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of anxiety in ophthalmologists, using the GAD-7 and Hamilton scales was of 48% and 83%, respectively, and most cases were of mild intensity.Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Mexicana de Oftalmologia.

Context: There is scarcity of data on thyroid function abnormality in COVID-19 patients in world literature. Aim(s): The objective of this study was to assess thyroid function tests in hospitalized patients of COVID-19. Settings and Design: Sixty (60) patients with COVID-19 detected by RT-PCR admitted in General Medicine isolation ward and COVID block of a tertiary care teaching hospital were selected by semi-purposive sampling. Material(s) and Method(s): These patients were assessed for thyroid function tests, including total T3, free T3, total T4, free T4, TSH and anti-TPO antibody along with other baseline investigations. Patients with pre-existing thyroid-related ailments, those on levothyroxine or anti-thyroid drugs or other drugs known to interfere with the results were excluded. Result(s): There were 43.3% patients in mild, 26.7% in moderate, and 30% in severe category, according to local COVID-19 severity classification protocol. 35% patients had one or more abnormality in the thyroid function, low TSH being the most common (18.33%). 9.1% patients had characteristic pattern of thyroiditis. In most of the others thyroid function did not match any typical pattern. There was no significant difference in any of the parameters of the thyroid function test between mild, moderate, and severe groups. Conclusion(s): Thyroid function may be abnormal in all categories of patients during COVID-19 infection, even in absence of pre-existing thyroid ailments. Although low TSH is the commonest abnormality and typical pattern of thyroiditis can be seen in a subsection of patients, in majority of the patients, thyroid function abnormality does not follow any characteristic pattern and likely represents a combination of thyroiditis and sick euthyroid syndrome in different points of its spectrum.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

0	"Minor Clinical Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency in Israel. In the last few months the world has witnessed a global pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Obviously, this pandemic affected individuals differently, with a significant impact on populations considered to be at high-risk. One such population, was assumed to be patients with primary genetic defect involving components or pathways of the immune system. While human immunity against COVID-19 is not fully understood, it is, so far, well documented, that both adaptive and innate cells have a critical role in protection against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aimed to summarize the clinical and laboratory data on primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients in Israel, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, in order to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on such patients. Data was collected from mid-February to end-September. During this time Israel experienced two ""waves"" of COVID-19 diseases; the first, from mid-February to mid-May and the second from mid-June and still ongoing at the end of data collection. A total of 20 PID patients, aged 4 months to 60 years, were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all but one, were detected during the second wave. Fourteen of the patients were on routine monthly IVIG replacement therapy at the time of virus detection. None of the patients displayed severe illness and none required hospitalization; moreover, 7/20 patients were completely asymptomatic. Possible explanations for the minimal clinical impact of COVID-19 pandemic observed in our PID patients include high level of awareness, extra-precautions, and even self-isolation. It is also possible that only specific immune pathways (e.g. type I interferon signaling), may increase the risk for a more severe course of disease and these are not affected in many of the PID patients. In some cases, lack of an immune response actually may be a protective measure against the development of COVID-19 sequelae.

0	EXPRESS: SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19): a short update on molecular biochemistry, pathology, diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. The ongoing coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic highlights the need for global scientific cooperation to advance our understanding of the immunological, molecular and biochemical mechanisms causing infection by this virus. Better understanding of key processes has allowed development of vaccines in record time, and of agents with the potential to treat and neutralise current and future coronavirus outbreaks. To date, clinically effective agents for prevention and treatment of covid-19 infections are limited. This review provides a brief synopsis regarding the molecular biology, pathology and laboratory tests commonly used in the diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19, as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies to manage its current and future mutations.	false
0	Complex differences in infection rates between ethnic groups in Scotland: a retrospective, national census-linked cohort study of 1.65 million cases. BACKGROUND: Ethnicity can influence susceptibility to infection, as COVID-19 has shown. Few countries have systematically investigated ethnic variations in infection., METHODS: We linked the Scotland 2001 Census, including ethnic group, to national databases of hospitalizations/deaths and serological diagnoses of bloodborne viruses for 2001-2013. We calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) in 12 ethnic groups for all infections combined, 15 infection categories, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses., RESULTS: We analysed over 1.65 million infection-related hospitalisations/deaths. Compared with White Scottish, RRs for all infections combined were 0.8 or lower for Other White British, Other White and Chinese males and females, and 1.2-1.4 for Pakistani and African males and females. Adjustment for socioeconomic status or birthplace had little effect. RRs for specific infection categories followed similar patterns with striking exceptions. For HIV, RRs were 136 in African females and 14 in males; for HBV, 125 in Chinese females and 59 in males, 55 in African females and 24 in males; and for HCV, 2.3-3.1 in Pakistanis and Africans., CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic differences were found in overall rates and many infection categories, suggesting multiple causative pathways. We recommend census linkage as a powerful method for studying the disproportionate impact of COVID-19. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

0	Left ventricular global longitudinal strain in identifying subclinical myocardial dysfunction among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Background: The incidence of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is very often subclinical and can be detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to assess if subclinical myocardial dysfunction could be identified using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., Methods: We performed a search of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from January 1st, 2020 to June 8th, 2020, which revealed 589 patients (mean age = 66 +/- 18, male = 56%). All available 60 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were reviewed and off-line assessment of LV-GLS was performed in 40 studies that had sufficient quality images and the views required to calculate LV-GLS. We also analyzed electrocardiograms and laboratory findings including inflammatory markers, Troponin-I, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)., Results: Of 589 patients admitted with COVID-19 during our study period, 60 (10.1%) underwent TTE during hospitalization. Findings consistent with overt myocardial involvement included reduced ejection fraction (23%), wall motion abnormalities (22%), low stroke volume (82%) and increased LV wall thickness (45%). LV-GLS analysis was available for 40 patients and was abnormal in 32 patients (80%). All patients with LV dysfunction had elevated cardiac enzymes and positive inflammatory biomarkers., Conclusions: Subclinical myocardial dysfunction as measured via reduced LV-GLS is frequent, occurring in 80% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while prevalent LV function parameters such as reduced EF and wall motion abnormalities were less frequent findings. The mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 infection is the subject of ongoing research. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Sensitive detection of total anti-Spike antibodies and isotype switching in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Early detection of infections is crucial to limit the spread of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). Here, we develop a flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S protein) antibodies in COVID-19 patients. The assay detects specific IgM, IgA and IgG in COVID-19 patients and also the acquisition of all IgG subclasses, with IgG1 being the most dominant. The antibody response is significantly higher at a later stage of the infection. Furthermore, asymptomatic COVID-19 patients also develop specific IgM, IgA and IgG, with IgG1 as the most dominant subclass. Although the antibody levels are lower in asymptomatic infections, the assay is highly sensitive and detect 97% of asymptomatic infections. These findings demonstrate that the assay can be used for serological analysis of symptomatic infections, and also asymptomatic infections, which may, otherwise, go undetected.

0	Asymptomatic hypoxia in COVID-19 is associated with poor outcome. Objectives: Describe and evaluate the outcome of a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patient without shortness of breath. Design and methods: We retrospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed and cared for in Marseille, France. We selected data from patients who at admission, had a low dose CT scanner, dyspnea status, and oxygen saturation available. Blood gas was analyzed in a sample subset of patients. Results: Among 1712 patients with COVID-19, we report that 1107 (64.7%) do not complain of shortness of breath at admission. The low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan showed signs compatible with pneumonia in 757/1,107 (68.4%) of patients without dyspnea. In a subset of patients who had underwent at least one blood gas analysis (n = 161) and presented without dyspnea at admission, 28.1% (27/96) presented with a hypoxemia/hypocapnia syndrome. Asymptomatic hypoxia was associated with a very poor outcome (33.3% were transferred to the ICU and 25.9% died). Conclusion: The absence of shortness of breath in an old patient with comorbidity merit medical attention and should not be considered as a good sign of well-being. The poor prognosis of asymptomatic hypoxia, highlight the severity of this mild clinical presentation. In these patients, pulse oximetry is an important mean to predict the outcome along with news score and LDCT scanner. (C) 2020 The Authors.

0	"High cell density perfusion process for high yield of influenza A virus production using MDCK suspension cells. Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log10(HAU/100 muL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 x 106 cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log10(HAU/100 muL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 x 1010 virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness. KEY POINTS: * First MDCK suspension cell-based perfusion process for IAV produciton was established. * ""Cell density effect"" was overcome and process was intensified by reduction of medium use and automated process control. * The process achieved cell density over 40 x 106 cells/mL and virus yield over 4.37 log10(HAU/100 muL)."	false
0	Loneliness and social isolation: determinants of cardiovascular outcomes: Implications in COVID-19 era. One in three Americans report experiencing loneliness in everyday life, a number that has grown exponentially over the last few decades. As we respond to the SARS-COV2 pandemic with quarantine and social distancing, social isolation and feelings of loneliness are increasing among people of all ages. This presents as an opportune time to recognize the public health impact of these important psychosocial determinants. Loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher incidence of CVD, higher healthcare utilization and worse outcomes even after controlling for conventional risk factors of CVD. In this review, we discuss loneliness and social isolation as determinants of cardiovascular outcomes, the pathophysiology of this association, and its implications in clinical practice. We discuss some of the shortcomings in assessment of loneliness and social isolation while identifying most commonly used rating scales for the same. Finally, we suggest modifications to interventions for loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Performance of saliva specimens for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting: does sample collection method matter?. Background: Data on the performance of saliva specimens for diagnosing COVID-19 in ambulatory patients are scarce and inconsistent. We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the community setting and compared three different collection methods. Method(s): Prospective study conducted in three primary care centres. RT-PCR was performed in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centres: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW) and self-collection (SC). Result(s): NPS and saliva pairs of samples from 577 patients (median age 39 years, 44% men, 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS and kappa coefficients (K) for SVC, OPW and SC were 95% (K=0.85), 93.4% (K=0.76), and 93.3% (K=0.76), respectively. The sensitivity (95% CI) of the saliva specimens varied from 86% (72.6-93.7) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4-80) for SC samples. The sensitivity was higher in samples with lower cycle threshold (Ct) values. The best performance of RT-PCR was observed for SVC, with sensitivity (95% CI) for Ct values <=30 of 100% (85.9-100) in symptomatic, and 88.9% (50.7-99.4) in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusion(s): Saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting. Specimens collected under supervision perform comparably to NPS and can effectively identify individuals with higher risk of transmission in real life conditions.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	Real-life validation of the Panbio TM COVID-19 antigen rapid test (Abbott) in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Background: RT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 min and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined., Methods: The diagnostic value of the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.Findings : 1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n = 139) and 30.3% (n = 63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in Utrecht and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2-99.95%) in Aruba., Interpretation: In community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct-values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

0	Risk factors of developing critical conditions in Iranian patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 due to novel Coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China. Nowadays, the Islamic Republic of Iran stands among countries with high COVID-19 prevalence and high burden of disease. Since the medical resources are limited, we aimed to identify the risk factors for patients developing critical conditions. This can help to improve resource management and treatment outcomes. In this retrospective study, we included 12,677 patients who were from 26 hospitals, supervised by Tehran University of Medical Sciences with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, until April 12. University integrated IT system was adopted to collect the data. We performed Logistic regression to evaluate the association between death in COVID-19 positive patients and other variables. Cough, respiratory distress and fever were the most common symptoms in our patients, respectively. Cancer, chronic lung diseases and chronic neurologic diseases were the strongest risk factors for death in COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Semen impairment and occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in semen after recovery from COVID-19. STUDY QUESTION: How is the semen quality of sexually active men following recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Twenty-five percent of the men with recent SARS-Cov-2 infections and proven healing were oligo-crypto-azoospermic, despite the absence of virus RNA in semen., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human semen and its role in virus contagion and semen quality after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unclear. So far, studies evaluating semen quality and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of infected or proven recovered men are scarce and included a limited number of participants., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A prospective cross-sectional study on 43 sexually active men who were known to have recovered from SARS-CoV2 was performed. Four biological fluid samples, namely saliva, pre-ejaculation urine, semen and post-ejaculation urine, were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Female partners were retested if any specimen was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Routine semen analysis and quantification of semen leukocytes and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were performed., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Questionnaires including International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Short Form were administered to all subjects. The occurrence of virus RNA was evaluated in all the biological fluids collected by RT-PCR. Semen parameters were evaluated according to the World Health Organization manual edition V. Semen IL-8 levels were evaluated by a two-step ELISA method., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After recovery from COVID-19, 25% of the men studied were oligo-crypto-azoospermic. Of the 11 men with semen impairment, eight were azoospermic and three were oligospermic. A total of 33 patients (76.7%) showed pathological levels of IL-8 in semen. Oligo-crypto-azoospermia was significantly related to COVID-19 severity (p < 0.001). Three patients (7%) tested positive for at least one sample (one saliva; one pre-ejaculation urine; one semen and one post-ejaculation urine), so the next day new nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The results from these three patients and their partners were all negative for SARS-CoV-2., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although crypto-azoospermia was found in a high percentage of men who had recovered from COVID-19, clearly exceeding the percentage found in the general population, the previous semen quality of these men was unknown, nor is it known whether a recovery of testicular function was occurring. The low number of enrolled patients may limit the statistical power of study., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva, urine and semen in a small percentage of men who recovered from COVID-19. One-quarter of men who recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated oligo-crypto-azoospermia indicating that an assessment of semen quality should be recommended for men of reproductive age who are affected by COVID-19., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: n/a.

0	"Body-Worn Sensors for Remote Monitoring of Parkinson's Disease Motor Symptoms: Vision, State of the Art, and Challenges Ahead. The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and related mobility issues places a serious burden on healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the urgent need for better tools to manage chronic conditions remotely, as regular access to clinics may be problematic. Digital health technology in the form of remote monitoring with body-worn sensors offers significant opportunities for transforming research and revolutionizing the clinical management of PD. Significant efforts are being invested in the development and validation of digital outcomes to support diagnosis and track motor and mobility impairments ""off-line"". Imagine being able to remotely assess your patient, understand how well they are functioning, evaluate the impact of any recent medication/intervention, and identify the need for urgent follow-up because things are changing? This could offer new pragmatic solutions for personalized care and clinical research. So the question remains: how close are we to achieving this? Here, we describe the state-of-the-art based on representative papers published between 2017 and 2020. We focus on remote (i.e., real-world, daily-living) monitoring of PD using body-worn sensors (e.g., accelerometers, inertial measurement units) for assessing motor symptoms and their complications. Despite the tremendous potential, existing challenges exist (e.g., validity, regulatory) that are preventing the widespread clinical adoption of body-worn sensors as a digital outcome. We propose a roadmap with clear recommendations for addressing these challenges and future directions to bring us closer to the implementation and widespread adoption of this important way of improving the clinical care, evaluation, and monitoring of PD."	false

DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time., PURPOSE: The objectives and strategies used by an ambulatory care pharmacy team operating within a large health system's pharmacy incident command structure during the initial response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are discussed., SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, a pharmacy ""ambulatory action team"" was formed to provide ambulatory clinical pharmacy expertise and meet an immediate and ongoing need to limit nonemergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. By building a strong communication infrastructure and partnership with ambulatory care providers, clinic medical and operational leaderships, clinical laboratory staff, and infusion centers, the team was able to swiftly execute solutions and respond to new issues and requests. Ambulatory care pharmacy practice continued to advance through provision of services to vulnerable patient populations with chronic conditions that were anticipated to experience gaps in care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts resulted in expansion of pharmacists' involvement in collaborative drug therapy management, support of patients' transition from in-clinic injection to home self-administration, provision of medication assistance support, and management of 1,300 patients via protocol-based warfarin management. Additionally, ambulatory pharmacy services in 15 primary care, anticoagulation, and specialty clinic sites were transitioned to telehealth. The ambulatory action team also implemented several strategies to manage medication therapy associated with COVID-19-related shortages and implemented electronic decision support to guide prescribing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin., CONCLUSION: Building a strong communication infrastructure and a pharmacy ambulatory action team were essential to respond to a crisis and continue ambulatory clinical pharmacy services expansion.

0	COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations: does HHV-6 play an etiological role?. Recently, during the development of COVID-19 pandemic, several publications have warned of possible cutaneous manifestations in association with this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In our hospital we have created a multidisciplinary unit with a specific protocol to attend patients with these manifestations. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who, during the development of the pandemic, were clinically suspected and/or microbiologically confirmed of COVID-19 and had a recent-onset skin rash (within the last 4 weeks). All patients underwent biochemistry, hematimetry and serology for parvovirus B19 and for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), as well as other serologies and a coagulation study according to clinical manifestations. Based on the findings, we also randomly selected 12 hospitalized patients, with similar median age, with COVID-19 but without cutaneous manifestations, and we requested HHV-6 serology. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay was Roche's Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the HHV-6 antibody assay was ELISA-VIDITEST anti-HHV-6 IgM (Vidia). The protocol was approved by the Aragon Ethical Committee for Clinical Research.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19: a new burden of respiratory disease among South African miners?. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mineworkers in South Africa experience a triple burden of disease due to their distinct work experience. Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Is recurrence possible in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Case series and systematic review of literature. Can a patient diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) be infected again? This question is still unsolved. We tried to analyze local and literature cases with a positive respiratory swab after recovery. We collected data from symptomatic patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Italian Umbria Region that, after recovery, were again positive for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract specimens. Samples were also assessed for infectivity in vitro. A systematic review of similar cases reported in the literature was performed. The study population was composed of 9 patients during a 4-month study period. Among the new positive samples, six were inoculated in Vero-E6 cells and showed no growth and negative molecular test in culture supernatants. All patients were positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and/or S protein. Conducting a review of the literature, 1350 similar cases have been found. The presumptive reactivation occurred in 34.5 days on average (standard deviation, SD, 18.7 days) after COVID-19 onset, when the 5.6% of patients presented fever and the 27.6% symptoms. The outcome was favorable in 96.7% of patients, while the 1.1% of them were still hospitalized at the time of data collection and the 2.1% died. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain new positive respiratory samples after confirmed negativity. According to this study, the phenomenon seems to be due to the prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces in respiratory samples of recovered patients. The failure of the virus to replicate in vitro suggests its inability to replicate in vivo.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of BBV152, whole virion inactivated SARS- CoV-2 vaccine candidates in the Syrian hamster model. The availability of a safe and effective vaccine would be the eventual measure to deal with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) threat. Here, we have assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates BBV152A, BBV152B, and BBV152C in Syrian hamsters. Three dose vaccination regimes with vaccine candidates induced significant titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. BBV152A and BBV152B vaccine candidates remarkably generated a quick and robust immune response. Post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated hamsters did not show any histopathological changes in the lungs. The protection of the hamster was evident by the rapid clearance of the virus from lower respiratory tract, reduced virus load in upper respiratory tract, absence of lung pathology, and robust humoral immune response. These findings confirm the immunogenic potential of the vaccine candidates and further protection of hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Of the three candidates, BBV152A showed the better response.

0	Experiences from the German COVID-19 register. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections represent a particular risk for several groups of patients with nephrological diseases. Patients on dialysis represent a particularly vulnerable group during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Initial data from international registries show a much higher mortality of dialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Because of the substantial differences between the healthcare systems, (state) preventive measures and treatment possibilities etc., in the different countries worldwide, local and national registry data cannot be easily transferred. In order to gain a reliable overview of the prevalence and mortality of dialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany, the German Society of Nephrology implemented a national registry for dialysis patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within this framework a standardized collection of these data is carried out on a weekly basis, which should enable a real-time overview of the case numbers and perhaps the acquisition of new scientific knowledge. Particularly in the current phase of the pandemic (autumn 2020), which is accompanied by a multiplication of the numbers of daily new-onset cases within only a few weeks, such data are highly relevant for the estimation and adjustment of the personnel, structural and organizational needs as well as the capacities for the treatment of patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	false

OBJECTIVE: To determine the acceptance of a potential coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among the general adult population in Kuwait and assess its determinants., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted by enrolling adults living in Kuwait (n = 2368; aged >=21 years). Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was inferred if participants indicated that they ""definitely or probably will accept vaccination against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available."" Associations were explored by applying a modified Poisson regression to estimate and infer adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI)., RESULTS: In total, 53.1% (1257/2368) of the participants were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once available. Male subjects were more willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine than females (58.3% vs. 50.9%, P < 0.001). Subjects who viewed vaccines in general to have health-related risks were less willing to accept vaccination (aPR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.35-0.44). Moreover, participants who previously received an influenza vaccine were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31-1.58). Willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 increased as the self-perceived chances of contracting the infection increased (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Overall, 53.1% of the study participants demonstrated willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We found several factors influencing the level of acceptance. Since vaccination appears to be an essential preventive measure that can halt the COVID-19 pandemic, factors relating to low vaccine acceptance need to be urgently addressed by public health strategies.

0	Infection control strategy and primary care assistance in Campania region during the national lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak: the experience of two tertiary emergency centers. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has markedly affected emergency care, due to sudden limitation of health care capacity by general practitioners (GP) and urgent need for infection control strategies. We evaluated the activity of the Emergency Department (ED) during the national lockdown (March 8-April 30), as well as the outcomes of our infection control strategy., RESULTS: Despite a reduction in access by one fifth, a proportion of febrile patients comparable to 2019 was seen (829/2492, 33.3% vs 4580/13.342, 34.3%, p = 0.3). Diagnostic swab for COVID-19 was performed in 25% of patients, especially in subjects with co-morbidities or multiple access. Six infected cases were identified, all presenting with febrile disease. Only two positive patients fulfilled the criteria for diagnostic swab provided by the Italian Health Authorities, because of close contact with suspected or confirmed cases. The rate of admission for febrile or respiratory conditions was higher than the same period of 2019 (33.4% vs 25.9%, p < 0.0001). None of the 105 health-care professionals working during the study time lapse exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. Among the 589 patients with information available, 54.9% declared no medical consultation at all prior to coming to ED, while only 40 (of which 27 with fever) had been examined by their GP before coming to ED. Nevertheless, 35.6% of the cases were already taking medications. None of the 9 patients requiring intensive care reported recent pediatric consultation, despite symptoms duration up to 30 days., CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the reduced capacity of primary care facilities during the national lockdown may have caused a high rate of self-medication as well as a delayed provision of care in some patients. Identification of pediatric patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a challenge because of the absence of reliable predictive factors. Finally, the use of specific triage centers, with dedicated pathways to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, trace contacts and allow adequate care after swabs, is effective in preventing spreading of the infection.	false
0	Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in COVID-19: study protocol for a global registry of women with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and their neonates, understanding natural history to guide treatment and prevention. INTRODUCTION: Previous novel COVID-19 pandemics, SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome observed an association of infection in pregnancy with preterm delivery, stillbirth and increased maternal mortality. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is the largest pandemic in living memory.Rapid accrual of robust case data on women in pregnancy and their babies affected by suspected COVID-19 or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will inform clinical management and preventative strategies in the current pandemic and future outbreaks., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) registry are an observational study collecting focused data on outcomes of pregnant mothers who have had suspected COVID-19 in pregnancy or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their neonates via a web-portal. Among the women recruited to the PAN-COVID registry, the study will evaluate the incidence of: (1) miscarriage and pregnancy loss, (2) fetal growth restriction and stillbirth, (3) preterm delivery, (4) vertical transmission (suspected or confirmed) and early onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection.Data will be centre based and collected on individual women and their babies. Verbal consent will be obtained, to reduce face-to-face contact in the pandemic while allowing identifiable data collection for linkage. Statistical analysis of the data will be carried out on a pseudonymised data set by the study statistician. Regular reports will be distributed to collaborators on the study research questions., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received research ethics approval in the UK. For international centres, evidence of appropriate local approval will be required to participate, prior to entry of data to the database. The reports will be published regularly. The outputs of the study will be regularly disseminated to participants and collaborators on the study website (https://pan-covid.org) and social media channels as well as dissemination to scientific meetings and journals., STUDY REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN68026880.

0	Respiratory infections during lithium and valproate medication: a within-individual prospective study of 50,000 patients with bipolar disorder. BACKGROUND: In vitro studies have demonstrated that lithium has antiviral properties, but evidence from human studies is scarce. Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer to treat patients with bipolar disorder. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between lithium use and the risk of respiratory infections in patients with bipolar disorder. To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithium's effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of valproate, which is an alternative to lithium used to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder., METHOD: We followed 51,509 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Swedish Patient register 2005-2013. We applied a within-individual design using stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of respiratory infections during treated periods compared with untreated periods., RESULTS: During follow-up, 5,760 respiratory infections were documented in the Swedish Patient Register. The incidence rate was 28% lower during lithium treatment (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) and 35% higher during valproate treatment (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.73) compared with periods off treatment., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world evidence that lithium is associated with decreased risk for respiratory infections and suggests that the repurposing potential of lithium for potential antiviral or antibacterial effects is worthy of investigation.	false
0	The impact of quarantine on mental health status among general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine and isolation measures urgently adopted to control the COVID-19 pandemic might potentially have negative psychological and social effects. We conducted this cross-sectional, nationwide study to ascertain the psychological effect of quarantine and identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among population quarantined to further inform interventions of mitigating mental health risk especially for vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions. Sociodemographic data, attitudes toward the COVID-19, and mental health measurements of 56,679 participants from 34 provinces in China were collected by an online survey from February 28 to March 11, 2020. Of the 56,679 participants included in the study (mean [SD] age, 36.0 [8.2] years), 27,149 (47.9%) were male and 16,454 (29.0%) ever experienced home confinement or centralized quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak. Compared those without quarantine and adjusted for potential confounders, quarantine measures were associated with increased risk of total psychological outcomes (prevalence, 34.1% vs 27.3%; odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.28-1.39; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that vulnerable groups of the quarantined population included those with pre-existing mental disorders or chronic physical diseases, frontline workers, those in the most severely affected areas during outbreak, infected or suspected patients, and those who are less financially well-off. Complying with quarantine, being able to take part in usual work, and having adequate understanding of information related to the outbreak were associated with less mental health issues. These results suggest that quarantine measures during COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased risk of experiencing mental health burden, especially for vulnerable groups. Further study is needed to establish interventions to reduce mental health consequences of quarantine and empower wellbeing especially in vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2-Associated T-Cell Responses in the Presence of Humoral Immunodeficiency. We report perhaps the most comprehensive study of subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ and subsets of B cells in a mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2+ immunocompetent patient and a common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID) patient who had normal absolute lymphocyte counts and remained negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Naive (TN), central memory (TCM), effector memory (TEM), and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, subsets of T follicular helper cells (cTFH, TFH1, TFH2, TFH17, TFH1/TFH17, and TFR), CD4 Treg, CD8 Treg, mature B cells, transitional B cells, marginal zone B cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, CD21low B cells, antibody-secreting cells (plasmablasts), and Breg cells were examined in patients and age-matched controls with appropriate monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls using multicolor flow cytometry. Different patterns of abnormalities (often contrasting) were observed in the subsets of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B-cell subsets, and regulatory lymphocytes among the immunocompetent patient and CVID patient as compared to corresponding healthy controls. Furthermore, when data were analyzed between the 2 patients, the immunocompetent patient demonstrated greater changes in various subsets as compared to the CVID patient. These data demonstrate different immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompetent patient and the CVID patient. A marked decrease in GC B cells and plasmablasts may be responsible for failure to make SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with mild clinical disease suggests an important role of T-cell response in defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.	false
0	"Temporal variations in the diagnostic performance of chest CT for Covid-19 depending on disease prevalence: Experience from North-Eastern France. Rationale and Objective: The purpose of this work was to analyze temporal variations in the diagnostic performance of chest CT for Covid-19 throughout the first wave, depending on disease prevalence variations between the ascending, peak and descending phases of the epidemic in North-Eastern France. Materials and Methods: From March 6th to April 22nd 2020, all consecutive adult patients referred to the ""Covid-19 clinic"" of our Emergency Department with the availability of chest CT and of at least one RT-PCR result were retrospectively included in the present study. Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily. CT diagnostic performance were calculated and variations between phases were tested for equivalence or difference using Bayesian methods. Results: 2194 consecutive chest CT were analyzed. Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists. Variations between the ascending (11 days, 281 chest CT, disease prevalence 37.0 %), the peak (18 days, 1167 chest CT, disease prevalence 64 %) and the descending phases (19 days, 746 chest CT, disease prevalence 32.2 %) were highest for PPV and NPV with a probability of difference >99.9 %, and smallest for accuracy and specificity with a probability of equivalence >98.8 %. Conclusion: In a homogenous cohort of 2194 consecutive chest CT performed over a 7-week epidemic wave, we observed significant variations of CT predictive values whereas CT specificity appeared marginally affected."	false
0	Cladribine to halt deterioration in people with advanced multiple sclerosis (chariotms). Background: Whilst the introduction of disease modifying treatments (DMTs) has transformed the management of people with early/relapsing MS (pwRMS), the use of DMTs in people with MS who are largely or completely wheel chair-dependent (EDSS>6.5) remains controversial. Evidence suggests that slowing or stopping disease deterioration is possible even past this arbitrary (loss of ambulatory function) threshold. Pathology and anecdotal clinical data support the hypothesis that even at an advanced stage of MS (AMS) inflammatory activity is a key driver of functional decline and that effective immunotherapy may halt this process. Cladribine tablets are a highly effective and central nervous system (CNS) penetrant DMT for people with highly-active RMS. It effectively depletes B cells, particularly memory B cells, a likely key mechanism of disease control in MS. Evidence, suggesting that (i) a significantly higher number of CNS axons supply upper compared to lower limb functions and (ii) longer axons are more vulnerable to the effects of focal inflammatory demyelination than shorter ones, corroborate our hypothesis that upper limb function can be protected even beyond EDSS=6.5. Objective(s): Primary Objective: To investigate whether cladribine tablets over 24 months is an effective DMT in people with AMS (pwAMS; EDSS=6.5-8.5) as measured using the 9-hole peg test (9HPT) peg speed. Secondary Objectives: To establish whether there is a difference in pwAMS between treatment with cladribine tablets or placebo in (i) blood/serum biomarkers of inflammation (lymphocyte subsets) and/or neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain), (ii) MRI loss of brain volume and spinal cord cross sectional area, (iii) T2 lesion burden, (iv) hypointense lesions on T1 weighted scans, (v) quality of life, and (vi) whether cladribine is a cost-effective treatment for pwAMS. Method(s): Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial. To detect a 15% treatment effect in 9HPT peg speed with 90% power at 5% significance and 20% drop-out over 104 weeks n=200 pwAMS will be recruited across 20 UK MS centres. Result(s): Protocol and ancillary documents have been submitted for ethics approval. So far 17 centres have agreed to recruit pwAMS for ChariotMS. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic start of recruitment has been deferred to 04 Jan 2021. Conclusion(s): ChariotMS will be the first DMT-trial focussing on pwAMS. If successful, ChariotMS would expand the DMT landscape to include pwAMS and provide a platform for add-on therapies.	false
0	Marked increase of csf sampling induced vasovagal response secondary to COVID-19 pandemic. Background: According to 2017 McDonald criteria, CSF analysis is useful for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Incidence of vasovagal response after spinal anesthesia, a similar procedure to spinal tap, is estimated around 4-5 % in the published literature[i]. Since the implementation of new sanitary measures for COVID- 19 pandemic (mask for patient and medical staff, face shield for the staff), the author suspected an increase in vasovagal response occurring in patients during spinal tap procedure. [i] Vahabi S, Slavash B, Badiozaman R. The incidence of vasovagal response in spinal anesthesia during surgery. J Anest & Inten Care Med. 2018; 5(1). Objective(s): Under an unchanged practice setting of the author, the objective is to compare the occurrence of vasovagal response in association with CSF sampling since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 in comparison with the previous year. Method(s): The author is working in an out-of-hospital private neurology clinic. CSF sampling are done within the clinic by the author using the same technical procedure for the last 3 years, using the sitting position for the vast majority. The patients' reactions to the procedure have been systematically documented in their chart. In a retrospective analysis, the author's patients undergoing a CSF examination since the beginning of the pandemic (2020-03-16) were compared to the ones from the previous year, specifically examining the occurrence of vasovagal response. Result(s): From 2020-03-23 to 2020-07-16, 15 patients (18-72 years, mean 46.4y) were sampled for CSF, 60% for multiple sclerosis suspicion. In the previous year, from 2019-03-01 to 2020- 02-12, 26 patients (26-82 years, mean 50.2y) were sampled, 46.2% for multiple sclerosis suspicion. 9 (46.7%) patients experienced a vasovagal response during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2 (7.7%) patients in the previous year (p = 0.003). One patient having recurrent vasovagal response during the procedure had to be referred for fluoroscopy, a situation that rarely occurs in the author's practice. As for confounding factors, there were more cardiovascular issues identified in the pre-pandemic cohort. Conclusion(s): A marked increase of vasovagal response after CSF sampling is observed since the beginning of the pandemic, in comparison to expected occurrence from previous year. Anxiety related to COVID-19 & the mask use (doctor or patient) are suspected factors in this increase. A study supports these findings; 47% of medical students that experienced syncope in operating theatre reported that wearing a surgical mask was a contributory factor[i]. Favoring a lateral decubitus position and particular COVID-19 reassurance have been implemented in the author's practice in order to decrease the occurrence of this unpleasant reaction. Follow-up is ongoing. [i] Jamjoom A, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald J. Operating theatre related syncope in medical students : a cross sectional study.	false
0	Application, Verification, and Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays with Emergency Use Authorization. Interest continues to grow regarding the role of serologic assays for the detection of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) status to many SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays. In this document, expert recommendations from clinical microbiologist members of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) concerning detailed verification strategies for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with FDA EUA are provided, as are insights into assay limitations and reporting considerations for laboratories. Assessments concerning single-antibody and multiantibody isotype detection assays, which may provide either differentiated or nondifferentiated (i.e., total antibody) antibody class results, are addressed. Additional considerations prior to assay implementation are also discussed, including biosafety, quality control, and proficiency testing strategies. As the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing is rapidly changing, this document provides updated guidance for laboratorians on application of these assays.Y	false
0	Predictors of households at risk for food insecurity in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 outbreak., DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model., SETTING: The United States during the week of March 30, 2020., PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses., RESULTS: 1,250 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 41% were identified as at risk for food insecurity after COVID-19, 55% were women and 73% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, living situation, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident risk for food insecurity. Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino respondents, respondents with annual income less than $100,000, and those living with children or others were significantly more likely to be newly at risk for food insecurity. Individuals at risk for food insecurity were 2.60 (95% CI 1.91-3.55) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.71 (95% CI 1.21-2.42) times more likely to screen positively for depression., CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between being at risk for food insecurity and anxiety/depression. Interventions to increase access to healthful foods, especially among minority and low-income individuals, and ease the socioemotional effects of the outbreak are crucial to relieving the economic stress of this pandemic.	false
0	Saliva samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. BACKGROUND: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been rapidly spreading throughout the world with confirmed case numbers already exceeding 75 millions. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment since it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19., METHODS: We did a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by RT-PCR., RESULTS: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4-70). None of the patients had fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real-time RT-PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80+/-3.44 and 30.64+/-2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p=0.016). The mean CT values of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27.18+/-3.53 and 30.24+/-3.29 vs. 28.36+/-3.31 and 30.98+/-2.39, respectively) were not significantly different (p=0.236 and p=0.733, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Saliva specimens can be considered as a reliable and less resource intensive alternative to nasopharyngeal specimens for screening asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

0	Viral infections and their relationship to neurological disorders. The chronic dysfunction of neuronal cells, both central and peripheral, a characteristic of neurological disorders, may be caused by irreversible damage and cell death. In 2016, more than 276 million cases of neurological disorders were reported worldwide. Moreover, neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death. Generally, the etiology of neurological diseases is not fully understood. Recent studies have related the onset of neurological disorders to viral infections, which may cause neurological symptoms or lead to immune responses that trigger these pathological signs. Currently, this relationship is mostly based on epidemiological data on infections and seroprevalence of patients who present with neurological disorders. The number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action by which viral infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of neurological disorders has been increasing over the years but these studies are still scarce. Comprehending the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel theories may favor the development of new strategies for diagnosis and therapy in the future. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to review the main pieces of evidence for the relationship between viral infection and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Viruses belonging to the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Retroviridae have been reported to be involved in one or more of these conditions. Also, neurological symptoms and the future impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family Coronaviridae that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019, are reported and discussed.	false
0	Clinical assessment of the Roche SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test. Novel point-of-care antigen assays present a promising opportunity for rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The purpose of this study was the clinical assessment of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test. The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was evaluated vs. a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory-based assay (Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV) in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from a series of consecutive patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to the Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) over a 2-week period. The final study population consisted of 321 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years and IQR, 32-56 years; 181 women, 56.4%), with 149/321 (46.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV Assay, and 109/321 (34.0%) positive with Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, respectively. The overall accuracy of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test compared to molecular testing was 86.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. Progressive decline in performance was observed as cycle threshold (Ct) values of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets increased. The sensitivity was found to range between 97-100% in clinical samples with Ct values <25, between 50-81% in those with Ct values between 25 and <30, but low as 12-18% in samples with Ct values between 30 and <37. The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is excellent in nasopharyngeal swabs with Ct values <25, which makes it a reliable screening test in patients with high viral load. However, mass community screening would require the use of more sensitive techniques.Copyright © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.	false

0	Validation of dried blood spot sample modifications to two commercially available COVID-19 IgG antibody immunoassays. Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 antibody testing often relies on venous blood collection, which is labor-intensive, inconvenient and expensive compared with finger-stick capillary dried blood spot (DBS) collection. The purpose of our work was to determine if two commercially available anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IgG antibodies against spike S1 subunit and nucleocapsid proteins could be validated for use with DBS. Material(s) and Method(s): Kit supplied reagents were used to extract DBS, and in-house DBS calibrators were included on every run. Result(s): Positive/negative concordance between DBS and serum was 100/99.3% for the spike S1 subunit assay and 100/98% for the nucleocapsid assay. Conclusion(s): Validation of the DBS Coronavirus disease 2019 IgG antibody assays demonstrated that serum and DBS can produce equivalent results with minimal kit modifications.Copyright © 2020 Theodore T Zava.	false
0	Experience of creating and the first results of the prospective hospital registry of patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and community-acquired pneumonia (TARGET-VIP). Objective. To describe the methodology for creating and the first results of the prospective hospital registry of patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and community-acquired pneumonia (TARGET-VIP) Material and methods. The registry included all patients admitted to the National Medical and Surgical Center named after N.I. Pirogov from April 6 to June 2, 2020 with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection and community-acquired pneumonia. All patients' data were taken from medical records. An additional survey of patients was performed (in the hospital or during the first 30 days of post-hospital period) in order to clarify data on risk factors, history of somatic and infectious diseases, pre-hospital drug therapy. At the outpatient stage, it is planned to collect data about the dynamics of clinical status and long-term outcomes in patients enrolled into the registry. For this purpose, a special survey of patients or their relatives during telephone contact 1-2, 6, 12 and 24 months after discharge from the hospital will be performed. Results. The registry included 1.130 patients (age 57.5+/-12.8 years, 51.2% men). COVID-19 was diagnosed in 60.7% of cases when PCR-tests were positive, and community-acquired pneumonia was confirmed in 94.2% of patents, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were diagnosed in 52.9% of cases. Among chronic non-cardiac diseases the incidence of digestive diseases (22.1%) and diabetes (16.3%) was maximal, but those with bronchial asthma and anemia - were minimal (3.1 and 3.5%, respectively). CVDs or non- CVDs were revealed in 75.8% of cases. Data on the values of height and body weight were available in the medical records in 97% of cases, but the calculation of body mass index (BMI) was practically not used. The incidence of obesity according to clinical diagnosis was 6.1% while BMI>=30 kg/m2 was revealed in 35.2% of cases. Hydroxychloroquine was administrated in 84.3% of patients, anticoagulants - in 84.2%, antibiotics - in 70.0%, glucocorticoids - in 15.2%, antiviral drugs - in 5.9%, immune-suppressants - in 8.6% of patients. The rate of prescriptions of ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (53.7%) and beta-blockers (45.6%) was bigger than those of other components of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in 598 patients with CVD. The hospital mortality rate was 4.2%. Among the age group 65 years and older mortality (9.7%) was 6 times higher than among younger patients (1.6%). Patients who died were 16 years older than survivals. The proportion of patients with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease was significantly bigger in non-survivals than in survivals (Odds Ratio after adjustment to age and sex was 2.2, 5.0 and 4.1, respectively; p<0.05). Conclusion. The majority of patients in the TARGET-VIP registry had COVID-19 (60.7% of PCR-tests were positive), communityacquired pneumonia (94.2%), CVDs of non-CVDs (75.8%). The incidence of obesity in clinical diagnosis was 6 times less than those according to the BMI value. The rate of prescription of hydroxychloroquine and anticoagulants was maximal (84.3 and 84.2%, respectively). Hospital mortality was 4.2%. Among the age group 65 years and older, hospital mortality was 6 times higher than among younger patients.Copyright © 2020, Media Sphera Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	Ultrasensitive measurement of both SARS-CoV2 RNA and serology from saliva. Tests for COVID-19 generally measure SARS-CoV2 viral RNA from nasal swabs or antibodies against the virus from blood. It has been shown, however, that both viral particles and antibodies against those particles are present in saliva, which is more accessible than both swabs and blood. We present methods for highly sensitive measurements of both viral RNA and serology from the same saliva sample. We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive serology test based on Single Molecule Array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test. We demonstrate that combining viral RNA detection by RT-qPCR with serology identifies more patients as infected than either method alone. Our results suggest the utility of combining viral RNA and serology testing from saliva, a single easily accessible biofluid.	false
0	Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Brazil is the third country most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. In spite of this, viral evolution in municipality resolution is poorly understood in Brazil and it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of viral spread. We identified four main circulating lineages in Esteio (Southern Brazil) and their relationship with global, national and regional lineages using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We provided a comprehensive view of viral mutations from a time- and age-representative sampling from May to October 2020, in Esteio (RS, Brazil), highlighting two frequent mutations in Spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the South African lineage B.1.351, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). A significant viral diversity was evidenced with the identification of 80 different SNPs. The E484K replacement was found in two genomes (9.5%) from samples obtained in mid-October, which is to our best knowledge the earliest description of E484K harboring SARS-CoV-2 in South Brazil. This mutation identified in a small municipality from the RS state demonstrates that it was probably widely distributed in the Brazilian territory, but went unnoticed so far by the lack of genomic surveillance in Brazil. The introduction of E484K mutants shows temporal correlation with later increases in new cases in our state. Importantly, since it has been associated with immune evasion and enhanced interaction with hACE-2, lineages containing this substitution must be the subject of intense surveillance. Our date demonstrates multiple introductions of the most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the major role of community transmission in viral spreading and the establishment of Brazilian lineages. This represents an important contribution to the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Generation of enzymatically competent SARS-CoV-2 decoy receptor ACE2-Fc in glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary host cell receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding and cell entry. Administration of high concentrations of soluble ACE2 can be utilized as a decoy to block the interaction of the virus with cellular ACE2 receptors and potentially be used as a strategy for treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human ACE2 is heavily glycosylated and its glycans impact on binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and virus infectivity. Here, we describe the production of a recombinant soluble ACE2-Fc variant in glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana. Our data reveal that the produced dimeric ACE2-Fc variant is glycosylated with mainly complex human-type N-glycans and functional with regard to enzyme activity, affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and wild-type virus neutralization.

0	Postmortem Findings Associated With SARS-CoV-2: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global threat to public health. COVID-19 is more pathogenic and infectious than the prior 2002 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-1. The pathogenesis of certain disease manifestations in COVID-19 such as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) are thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-1. However, the exact pathogenesis of COVID-19 related deaths remains poorly understood. The aim of this article was to systematically summarize the rapidly emerging literature regarding COVID-19 autopsies. A meta-analysis was also conducted based on data accrued from preprint and published articles on COVID-19 (n=241 patients) and the results compared with postmortem findings associated with SARS-CoV-1 deaths (n=91 patients). Both autopsy groups included mostly adults of median age 70 years with COVID-19 and 50 years with SARS-CoV-1. Overall, prevalence of DAD was more common in SARS-CoV-1 (100.0%) than COVID-19 (80.9%) autopsies (P=0.001). Extrapulmonary findings among both groups were not statistically significant except for hepatic necrosis (P <0.001), splenic necrosis (P<0.006) and while pulp depletion (P <0.001) that were more common with SARS-CoV-1. Remarkable postmortem findings in association with COVID-19 apart from DAD include pulmonary hemorrhage, viral cytopathic effect within pneumocytes, thromboembolism, brain infarction, endotheliitis, acute renal tubular damage, white pulp depletion of the spleen, cardiac myocyte necrosis, megakaryocyte recruitment, and hemophagocytosis.

0	The rapid response and utilisation of the advanced critical care practitioner group in a large critical care service based at the epicentre of the UK COVID 19 out break. Introduction: King's College Hospital in South East London was one of the acute hospitals most affected by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The institution treated more than 2000 patients with COVID 19 pneumonitis, 192 of whom required a critical care admission. The hospital expanded its critical care capacity from 69 to 196 ICU beds during the peak of the outbreak and was one the busiest critical care services in the UK with COVID 19 critical illness. Patients in our institution also had high severity COVID 19 due to the high prevalence of acute renal failure in 50% of our ICU admissions. A key component of the response of King's Critical Care was provided by the Advanced Critical Care Practitioners (ACCPs). The ACCP program, within King's Critical Care, was launched in 2017 using the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine curriculum delivered over two years (FICM, 2008). This first cohort consisted of seven intensive care nurses, two critical care paramedics, and two intensive care physiotherapists, with a combined total of over 100 years of intensive care unit (ICU) experience. 2 ACCPs were provided on each 12 hour shift. Here, we assess the contribution, performance and effectiveness of this team to the COVID 19 response through use of the Critical Care Informatics System and database. Specifically, the contribution of ACCPs to invasive interventions, proning (Gattinoni, 2020) and intra-hospital transfer were examined. Objective(s): To assess the utilisation and effectiveness of the ACCP group during the COVID 19 pandemic in a critical care service at the epicentre of the United Kingdom Outbreak. Method(s): Appropriate service improvement approvals were gained. The ICCA (Intellivue Critical Care & Anaesthesia, Philips HealthCare) database was queried for ACCP interventions (lines, intubations, proning procedures) during the COVID 19 pandemic. (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17). The ICCA complications audit table was also queried. The ACCP active directory role was queried to ensure anonimity of healthcare professionals and no patient identifiers are reported. Result(s): Within the ICCA dataset, the ACCP group were involved in the assessment and management of 177/192 patients admitted with COVID 19. They performed 86 central lines; 74 arterial lines; 29 vascaths and assisted 59 intubations across the Emergency Department; Critical Care and acute medical wards within our institution during the pandemic response. Additionally the ACCP group were the main providers of PICC line insertion. No immediate adverse events were reported. The ACCP group were tasked with the challenge of setting up and delivering a prone service for patients with oxygenation failure due to ARDS. Throughout their training they had been signed off as airway competent and able to perform stable intubated transfers, empowering them to lead and orchestrate in total 64 prone positions with only 2 adverse events and zero events leading to immediate patient harm. The ACCP team independently performed 56 intra-hospital patient transfers, with only two adverse events and no direct patient harm. The interventional procedures performed by ACCPs had less complications recorded than those performed by physicians and higher documentation compliance (eg seldinger wire out confirmation/use of check-lists). Finally, the ACCPs played a key role in developing and delivering simulation training for the resuscitation (including rapid-sequence intubation, transfer and proning) of critically ill patients with COVID 19. Conclusion(s): The 2020 COVID 19 pandemic confirmed the critical role that the ACCP group play within the critical care service at our institution. The inherent strengths of the ACCP team, such as geopolitical awareness; awareness of protocols; a willingness to follow protocols; longevity as a team (no rotation); high technical skills led to the ability of this team to rapidly adapt at a time of unprecedented operational and clinical strain. Specifically, the ACCP group were able to bridge the communications between strained medical and nursing teams, enabling structured and systematic task-based management of patients with severe COVID 19 illness in very difficult clinical settings with ad hoc organ support systems and critical supply chain pressures. Further work is planned, to use these operational and clinical observations from the ACCP response during the COVID 19 pandemic, to further develop this service. One key goal will be to explore independent working from ACCPs.	false

0	Analysis of susceptible population and pathogenic factors of COVID-19 based on TCM theory. Objectives: To analyze the gender, age, distribution, and route of infection of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia, explore the pathogenic factors of new coronary pneumonia, and provide refere: nces for the prevention and treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Method(s): Taking Henan Province as an example, the public information of patients diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia released by the health committees of various places in Henan Province was statistically analyzed by gender, age, distribution, and infection route. Result(s): The data shows that among the 831 confirmed cases with complete gender information, 456 were males, accounting for 54.87%; 375 were females, accounting for 45.13%; the average age of 837 confirmed cases with complete age information was 45, the youngest It is 0 year old (5 days), and the oldest is 94 years old. Among them, the 31-65 years old age group has the largest number of diagnoses, accounting for 71.48%. Conclusion(s): The protection of new coronary pneumonia should be strengthened, and active interventions aimed at the risk and susceptibility factors of new coronary pneumonia are not only to prevent and treat new coronary pneumonia, but also to reduce the incidence of susceptible populations.	false
0	A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses. There is need for effective and affordable vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a protein nanoparticle vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the display of coronavirus spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a synthetic virus-like particle (VLP) platform, SpyCatcher003-mi3, using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induce a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that is superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluate antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we show that RBD-SpyVLP induces a polyclonal antibody response that recognises key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence. The data suggests that RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	STAY (GI) HEALTHY: COVID-19 and Gastrointestinal manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for COVID-19, whose clinical spectrum ranges widely, both in terms of severity and multi-organicity. SARS-CoV-2 mainly involves the respiratory tract, causing from a flu-like syndrome to interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although its entry receptor, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, is typically expressed in epithelial cells of the airways, extra-pulmonary involvement has been consistently demonstrated since the beginning of the outbreak. Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 maybe be explained by the abundant expression of ACE2 in the digestive tract. Moreover, not only COVID-19 patients often present with GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain) and liver tests abnormalities, but there are also data showing active viral replication in the GI tract and possible fecal-oral transmission. Aim of this review is to summarize the evidence regarding prevalence and clinical significance of GI involvement and liver abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, providing the reader with evidence-based recommendations on the management of these conditions.

0	Social determinants of health and diabetes: A scientific review. Decades of research have demonstrated that diabetes affects racial and ethnic minority and low-income adult populations in the U.S. disproportionately, with relatively intractable patterns seen in these populations' higher risk of diabetes and rates of diabetes complications and mortality (1). With a health care shift toward greater emphasis on population health outcomes and value-based care, social determinants of health (SDOH) have risen to the forefront as essential intervention targets to achieve health equity (2-4). Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted unequal vulnerabilities borne by racial and ethnic minority groups and by disadvantaged communities. In the wake of concurrent pandemic and racial injustice events in the U.S., the American College of Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of General Internal Medicine, National Academy of Medicine, and other professional organizations have published statements on SDOH (5-8), and calls to action focus on amelioration of these determinants at individual, organizational, and policy levels (9-11). In diabetes, understanding and mitigating the impact of SDOH are priorities due to disease prevalence, economic costs, and disproportionate population burden (12-14). In 2013, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published a scientific statement on socioecological determinants of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (15). Toward the goal of understanding and advancing opportunities for health improvement among the population with diabetes through addressing SDOH, ADA convened the current SDOH and diabetes writing committee, prepandemic, to review the literature on 1) associations of SDOH with diabetes risk and outcomes and 2) impact of interventions targeting amelioration of SDOH on diabetes outcomes. This article begins with an overview of key definitions and SDOH frameworks. The literature review focuses primarily on U.S.-based studies of adults with diabetes and on five SDOH: Socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation); neighborhood and physical environment (housing, built environment, toxic environmental exposures); food environment (food insecurity, food access); health care (access, affordability, quality); and social context (social cohesion, social capital, social support). This review concludes with recommendations for linkages across health care and community sectors from national advisory committees, recommendations for diabetes research, and recommendations for research to inform practice.Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.	false
0	Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background and Aim: This review investigates the role of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations in COVID-19, particularly with regard to the prevalence of isolated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library for COVID-19 publications from 1 December 2019 to 18 May 2020. We included any study that reported the presence of GI symptoms in a sample of >5 COVID-19 patients. Data collection and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Where >=3 studies reported data sufficiently similar to allow calculation of a pooled prevalence, we performed random effects meta-analysis. Result(s): This review included 17 776 COVID-19 patients from 108 studies. Isolated GI symptoms only occurred in 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-6%) of patients. GI symptoms were reported in 20% (95% CI 15-24%) of patients. The most common were anorexia (21%, 95% CI 15-27%), diarrhea (13%, 95% CI 11-16%), nausea or vomiting (8%, 95% CI 6-11%), and abdominal pain (4%, 95% CI 2-6%). Transaminase elevations were present in 24% (95% CI 17-31%) of patients. Higher prevalence of GI symptoms were reported in studies published after 1st April, with prevalence of diarrhea 16% (95% CI 13-20), nausea or vomiting 12% (95% CI 8-16%), and any GI symptoms 24% (95% CI 18-34%). GI symptoms were associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.2), but not mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52-1.54). Conclusion(s): Patients with isolated GI symptoms may represent a small but significant portion of COVID-19 cases. When testing resources are abundant, clinicians should still consider testing patients with isolated GI symptoms or unexplained transaminase elevations for COVID-19. More recent studies estimate higher overall GI involvement in COVID-19 than was previously recognized.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Kinetics and correlates of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A detailed understanding of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 immunity has critical implications for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and for informing on vaccination strategies. In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in a cohort of 963 recovered individuals over a period of 10 months. Investigating a total of 2,146 samples, we detected an initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of recovered patients demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, defining them as ‘elite neutralizers’. These individuals also possessed effective cross-neutralizing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 without any known prior exposure to this virus. By applying multivariate statistical modeling, we found that sero-reactivity, age, time since disease onset, and fever are key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in mild courses of COVID-19. Investigating longevity of the antibody response, we detected loss of anti-spike reactivity in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Moreover, neutralizing activity had an initial half-life of 6.7 weeks in serum versus 30.8 weeks in purified IgG samples indicating the presence of a more stable and long-term memory IgG B cell repertoire in the majority of individuals recovered from COVID-19. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum of the initial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response depending on clinical characteristics, with antibodies being maintained in the majority of individuals for the first 10 months after mild course of COVID-19.	false
0	Efficacy and safety of OM-85 in paediatric recurrent respiratory tract infections which could have a possible protective effect on COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis. Introduction: The OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom) consumption has drawn considerable attention in the prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections. However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. Method(s): A systematic literature search up-to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM-85. They were reporting relationships between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. Result(s): OM-85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.66 to -0.65, P <.001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, -19.51; 95% CI, -23.00 to -16.01, P <.001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77, P =.006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.63 to 0.17, P =.03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52, P <.001). However, OM-85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52-2.03, P =.94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.08, P =.14). Conclusion(s): The impact of OM-85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects' immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations, eg, COVID-19 pandemic. OM-85 non-consumers had an independent risk relationship with recurrent respiratory tract infections. This relationship forces us to recommend OM-85 consumption with those with a high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections to avoid any possible complications.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false
0	Anti-heart antibodies levels and their correlation with clinical symptoms and outcomes in patients with confirmed or suspected diagnosis COVID-19. The aim of this study is to evaluate the blood level of anti-heart antibodies (AHA) and its correlation with clinical outcomes in patients with severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study included 34 patients (23 males; mean age 60.2 +/- 16.6 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Besides standard medical examination, the AHA blood levels were observed, including antinuclear antibodies, antiendothelial cell antibodies, anti-cardiomyocyte antibodies (AbC), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), and cardiac conducting tissue antibodies. Median hospital length of stay was 14 [13; 18] days. AHA levels were increased in 25 (73.5%) patients. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) of AHA levels with cardiovascular manifestations (r = 0.459) was found. AbC levels correlated with pneumonia severity (r = 0.472), respiratory failure (r = 0.387), need for invasive ventilation (r = 0.469), chest pain (r = 0.374), low QRS voltage (r = 0.415), and levels of C-reactive protein (r = 0.360) and lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.360). ASMA levels were found to correlate with atrial fibrillation (r = 0.414, p < 0.05). Antinuclear antibodies and AbC levels correlated with pericardial effusion (r = 0.721 and r = 0.745, respectively, p < 0.05). The lethality rate was 8.8%. AbC and ASMA levels correlated significantly with lethality (r = 0.363 and r = 0.426, respectively, p < 0.05) and were prognostically important. AHA can be considered as part of the systemic immune and inflammatory response in COVID-19. Its possible role in the inflammatory heart disease requires further investigation.Copyright © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH	false
0	Clinical Presentations and Outcomes in Transplant Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. <h4>Introduction: </h4> Transplant patients are a vulnerable group due to their immunocompromised status. Understanding how COVID-19 can present in this group is clinically important. Therefore, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical features and management of transplant patients with COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> Five databases were searched in May 2020 to include all relevant studies reporting clinical features or outcomes of COVID-19 infection in transplant patients. Data on clinical presentation, outcomes, lab values, imaging, and drug regimen were extracted. CMA software was used for meta-analysis. Protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020189458). <h4>Results: </h4> A total of 49 studies were finally included for analysis. Patients mainly complained from fever with event rate 74.40 % (95% CI= 69.4-78.8), cough 61.10% (95% CI= 55.8-66), and dyspnea 46.60% (95% CI= 69.4-78.8). Blood urea nitrogen 78.90% (95% CI= 54.7-92), ESR 78.10% (95% CI=52.3-92.1), and D-dimer 74.10% (95 % CI= 53-87.9) were the most elevated observed laboratory values. Ground glass opacities (GGO) were observed with event rate 68.10% (95% CI= 20.4-94.9). For treatment, immunosuppressants were used in 88.80% (95% CI= 77.6-94.8) of patients, followed by antibiotics and antiviral drugs 68.40% (95% CI= 52.4-80.9), 66.80% (95% CI = 45-83.2), respectively. Mechanical ventilation was used in 26.30% (95% CI=21-32.4) patients while 33.7% (95% CI= 20.7-49.9) intubated. Rejection occurred in 11% (95% CI= 4.4-25) of the patients. Finally, 18.20% (95% CI= 12.6-25.7) died. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Clinical characteristics and management in transplant COVID patients suggest the similar course in non-transplant. Fever, cough, dyspnoea, elevated blood urea nitrogen level, elevated CRP, elevated d-dimer, GGO, and consolidation were found to be the most frequent abnormalities. No direct, comparative analysis with non-transplant COVID population limited our results; however, numerous studies that examined the infected general population found similar, less augmented findings. Most of the included sample were kidney transplant patients; therefore, more studies are needed to address other types of COVID-19 infected transplant patients.	false
0	The assessment of serum ACE activity in COVID-19 and its association with clinical features and severity of the disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin (Ang) II pathway has crucial regulatory effects on circulatory hemostasis and immune responses. This pathway has a major role in the development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a devastating complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the serum ACE activity and its correlation with clinical features and the disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 by detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR were included in the study. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic investigations were recorded. Patients were classified by disease severity; asymptomatic, mild, and severe pneumonia. The serum ACE activity was evaluated with an autoanalyzer based on a spectrophotometric method. Fifty-five patients (50.9% female) and 18 healthy subjects (33.3 % female) were enrolled in the study. The median age of patients was 40 years, ranging from 22 to 81 years. Eighteen healthy subjects were served as the control group. The baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The median serum ACE activity of patients and controls (38.00 [IQR 21] U/L and 32.00 [IQR 24] U/L, respectively) and of between patients grouped by disease severity (38.5 [IQR 19], 36 [IQR 25], and 38 [IQR 22] U/L, asymptomatic, mild and severe pneumonia group, respectively) were similar. There was no correlation between the serum ACE activity and conventional inflammatory markers. In this study, we did not find an association between serum ACE activity and COVID-19 and serum ACE activity on admission did not reflect disease severity.Copyright © 2021 Medisinsk Fysiologisk Forenings Forlag (MFFF).	false
0	Elastase and Exacerbation of Neutrophil Innate Immunity are Involved in Multi-Visceral Manifestations of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Many arguments suggest that neutrophils could play a prominent role in COVID-19. However, the role of key components of neutrophil innate immunity in severe forms of COVID-19 has deserved insufficient attention. We aimed to evaluate the involvement of Neutrophil Elastase, histone-DNA, and DNases in systemic and multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19., METHODS: We performed a multicenter study of markers of neutrophil innate immunity in 155 cases consecutively recruited in a screening center, local hospitals, and two regional university hospitals. The cases were evaluated according to clinical and biological markers of severity and multi-organ manifestations and compared to 35 healthy controls., RESULTS: Blood Neutrophil Elastase, histone-DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA and free dsDNA were dramatically increased, and DNase activity decreased by 10-fold, compared to controls. Neutrophil Elastase and histone-DNA were associated with intensive care admission, body temperature, lung damage and markers of cardiovascular outcomes, renal failure and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and CXCR2. Neutrophil Elastase was an independent predictor of the computed tomography score of COVID-19 lung damage and the number of affected organs, in multivariate analyses. The increased blood concentrations of NE and neutrophil extracellular traps were related to exacerbation of neutrophil stimulation through IL8 and CXCR2 increased concentrations and increased serum DAMPs, and to impaired degradation of NETs as a consequence of the dramatic decrease of blood DNase activity., CONCLUSION: Our results point out the key role of neutrophil innate immunity exacerbation in COVID-19. Neutrophil Elastase and DNase could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of severe systemic manifestations of COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Mild versus Severe Liver Injury in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Abnormal liver function has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. The aim of our study was to report on the prevalence of liver injury in our cohort, to evaluate the association of mild versus severe liver injury with mortality in COVID-19 patients and to scrutinize the temporal pattern of viral detection and liver injury. Method(s): We present data from a German cohort of 147 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to their liver status during treatment. The first group included patients without elevated alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, the third group patients meeting the biochemical criteria of acute liver failure (ALF), and the second group all other patients. Result(s): Liver injury was detected in 75 (50.7%) and 93 (63%) patients by admission and during treatment, respectively. ALF was associated with the male sex, younger age, and higher BMI. Mortality was associated with the presence of ALF (OR = 9.423, 95% CI: 2.410-36.858) in contrast to milder liver injury (OR 1.101, 95% CI: 0.435-2.791). In 30% of patients with mild liver injury and in 50% of ALF patients, peak liver injury was observed at a time point when the virus was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. Conclusion(s): Mild liver injury was not associated with worse outcome in our cohort, and the pattern of liver injury did not fit well to the theory of SARS-CoV-2 directly causing liver impairment.

Introduction: The efficacy of fibrinolysis therapy with deferred percutaneous coronary angioplasty (FPCI) versus primary angioplasty (PPCI) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unclear when medical quarantine is needed., Patients and Methods: Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients underwent PPCI after finishing the screening protocol from January 23, 2020 to June 10, 2020 while FPCI was applied when COVID-19-confirmed cases reoccurred in Beijing near our hospital from June 11, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The door-to-balloon time (DTB) or door-to-needle time (DTN) as well as in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed to diminish the potential influence of confounding factors on the clinical outcomes., Results: A total of 126 STEMI patients underwent PPCI after finishing the screening protocol and 17 patients received FPCI before PSM. Patients who received FPCI were younger than patients who underwent PPCI (50.8+/-14.0 versus 64.1+/-14.2 years, p=0.001), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was less common in FPCI patients than in patients who underwent PPCI (0% versus 24.6%, p=0.024). The DTN was significantly shorter than DTB (25.8+/-4.2 versus 61.1+/-10.7, p=0.000) before PSM. The DTN was significantly shorter than DTB (26.9+/-4.2 versus 64.9+/-23.6, p=0.000); however, the incidence rate of in-hospital ischemia and bleeding adverse clinical outcomes were comparable between the two groups after PSM., Conclusion: Fibrinolysis therapy combined with deferred PCI can reduce the ischemia time and has a similar in-hospital adverse clinical outcome rate compared with patients who underwent primary PCI during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 muM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC50 (3.5 muM). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.

0	Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: A systematic review. Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a pandemic. Although pulmonary health has been the primary focus of studies during the early days of COVID-19, development of a comprehensive understanding of this emergent disease requires knowledge of all possible disease manifestations in affected patients. This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant review focuses on cutaneous manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients. Approach: Literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to examine various cutaneous manifestations related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Published articles (n = 56) related to search criteria from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020, were included. The primary literature articles included in this study were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Result(s): Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous manifestations have been found in people of all age groups, including children. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a new and serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment-related skin wounds are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for potential COVID-19 infections. Innovation and Conclusion(s): As this virus continues to spread silently, mainly through asymptomatic carriers, an accurate and rapid identification of these cutaneous manifestations may be vital to early diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This systematic review and photo atlas provide a detailed analysis of the skin pathologies related to COVID-19. Study of these cutaneous manifestations and their pathogenesis, as well their significance in human health will help define COVID-19 in its entirety, which is a prerequisite to its effective management.Copyright © 2021 by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	false
0	The impact of control measures and holiday seasons on incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Iran. Background: Preventive measures on the COVID-19 pandemic is an effective way to control its spread. We aimed to investigate the effect of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Iran. Study design: An observational study. Method(s): The daily data of confirmed new cases and deaths in Iran were taken from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database. We calculated weekly data from 19 Feb to 6 Oct 2020. To estimate the impact of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence rate of new cases and deaths, an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) with two hidden states fitted the data. The hidden states of the fitted model can distinguish the peak period from the non-peak period. Result(s): The control measures with a delay of one-week and two-week had a decreasing effect on the new cases in the peak and non-peak periods, respectively (P=0.005). The holiday season with a two-week delay increased the total number of new cases in the peak periods (P=0.031). The peak period for the occurrence of COVID-19 was estimated at 3 weeks. In the peak period of mortality, the control measures with a three-week delay decreased the COVID-19 mortality (P=0.010). The expected duration of staying in the peak period of mortality was around 6 weeks. Conclusion(s): When an increasing trend was seen in the country, the control measures could decline the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19. Implementation of official restrictions on holiday seasons could prevent an upward trend of incidence for COVID-19 during the peak period.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

0	Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Mexico, symptomatic profiles and presymptomatic people. OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 diagnosis is difficult and ambiguous due to nonspecific symptoms. Also, data from Mexico are hospitable population-based without signs and symptoms information. For these reasons, this work aims to provide epidemiology information about the burden of COVID-19 in the Mexican outpatients and to identify symptomatic COVID-19 profiles that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease., METHODS: Between June to September, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data of 482,413 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Salud Digna clinics were collected., RESULTS: We observed a 41% incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a mean age of 36 years, being young adults (20-40 years) the most affected. Among occupations, deliverers (OR 1.38) or informal traders (OR 1.33) had a higher risk of COVID-19. Moreover, 13% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in presymptomatic patients. Finally, we identify three different symptomatic profiles (common, respiratory, and gastrointestinal) associated with COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among outpatients with a significant proportion of presymptomatic carriers, so it is necessary increasing testing and continue the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with a better description of signs and symptoms; in this regard, were identified three symptomatic profiles that could help in the diagnose of COVID-19.

0	Slaying SARS-CoV-2 One (Single-domain) Antibody at a Time. Camelid-derived and synthetic single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are emerging as potent weapons against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. sdAbs are small, compact, thermostable immunoglobulin elements capable of binding targets with subnanomolar affinities. By leveraging the power of phage- and yeast surface-display technologies, rare sdAbs can be isolated from highly diverse and complex antibody libraries. Once in hand, sdAbs can be engineered to improve binding affinity, avidity, target specificities, and biodistribution. In this Opinion piece we highlight a series of sophisticated studies describing the identification of ultrapotent sdAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. We discuss the possible applications of these antibodies in the global fight against COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 in pediatric kidney transplantation: The Improving Renal Outcomes Collaborative. There are limited data on the impact of COVID-19 in children with a kidney transplant. We conducted a prospective cohort study through the Improving Renal Outcomes Collaborative (IROC) to collect clinical outcomes data about COVID-19 in pediatric kidney transplant patients. Twenty-two IROC centers that care for 2732 patients submitted testing and outcomes data for 281 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Testing indications included symptoms and/or potential exposures to COVID-19 (N=134, 47.7%) and/or testing per hospital policy (N=154, 54.8%). Overall, 24 (8.5%) patients tested positive, of which 15 (63%) were symptomatic. Of the COVID-19 positive patients, 16 were managed as outpatients, 6 received non-ICU inpatient care and 2 were admitted to the ICU. There were no episodes of respiratory failure, allograft loss, or death associated with COVID-19. To estimate incidence, sub-analysis was performed for thirteen centers that care for 1686 patients that submitted all negative and positive COVID-19 results. Of the 229 tested patients at these 13 centers, 10 (5 asymptomatic) patients tested positive, yielding an overall incidence of 0.6% and an incidence among tested patients of 4.4%. Pediatric kidney transplant patients in the U.S. had a low estimated incidence of COVID-19 disease and excellent short-term outcomes. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Generation and Characterization of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated public health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter expressing viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Henceforth, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large libraries of compounds and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput screening settings, to identify those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.

0	Awareness and Knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Dental Professionals According to the Turkish National Dental Guidelines. The objective of the current survey was to assess the awareness of the dental professionals according to the principals described by the Turkish Dental Association (TDA). A questionnaire including the socio-demographic data, specialties/academic degree, institutions/affiliations, the knowledge about COVID-19, the number of patients examined and dental treatments performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the knowledge of protection based on the guidelines described by TDA, contamination with COVID-19 and the psychological complaints has been used. A total of 947 (63.1%) dentists enrolled the study. The results showed satisfactory knowledge about the COVID-19 etiology, mode of transmission and the pre-procedural cautions as the majority of them had a fair level of knowledge with significantly higher knowledge among specialized respondents. The participants have also recorded a good judgment towards performing the emergency dental treatment during the current COVID-19 pandemic which corresponds with the guidelines determined by TDA. Considering the updates on the transmission of COVID-19 and protective strategies, there is an urgent need for improvement of dentists' knowledge about risk assessment via training programs. The incidence of positive testing among dental professionals also necessitates immediately testing of asymptomatic Turkish dental professionals.	false
0	A serological assay to detect human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can lead to severe respiratory illness. Patients with underlying comorbidities have a high risk of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, serological assays are urgently needed to diagnose asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, to estimate the prevalence of infection, and for disease prevention and control. This study aimed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Method(s): An ELISA test was designed and established to detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples from 41 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) - positive hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Forty-two convalescent patients' sera served as positive controls, while 117 pre-pandemic serum samples were used as negative controls. Result(s): A comparison between different SARS-CoV-2 proteins was performed, which included the full-length spike (S) protein and the S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S protein showed the strongest reactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients' serum samples. Additionally, since antibodies could be detected at very low concentrations, the assay was found to be sensitive. Conclusion(s): The current assay was specific, since cross-reactions with other SARS coronaviruses and respiratory viruses such as influenza were not found. Additionally, it was highly sensitive, since the test was able to identify antibodies even at very low concentrations. Therefore, this assay has promise as a screening method at the population level and may be used for in future seroepidemiological studies.Copyright © 2020 The Author	false

0	Impact of COVID-19 on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in a high-prevalence area. Background & Aims: Patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic and may suffer from altered allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of patients with HCC within 6 referral centres in the metropolitan area of Paris, France. Method(s): We performed a multicentre, retrospective, cross-sectional study on the management of patients with HCC during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (exposed group), compared with the same period in 2019 (unexposed group). We included all patients discussed in multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) meetings and/or patients undergoing a radiological or surgical programmed procedure during the study period, with curative or palliative intent. Endpoints were the number of patients with a modification in the treatment strategy, or a delay in decision-to-treat. Result(s): After screening, n = 670 patients were included (n = 293 exposed to COVID, n = 377 unexposed to COVID). Fewer patients with HCC presented to the MTB in 2020 (p = 0.034) and fewer had a first diagnosis of HCC (n = 104 exposed to COVID, n = 143 unexposed to COVID, p = 0.083). Treatment strategy was modified in 13.1% of patients, with no differences between the 2 periods. Nevertheless, 21.5% vs. 9.5% of patients experienced a treatment delay longer than 1 month in 2020 compared with 2019 (p <0.001). In 2020, 7.1% (21/293) of patients had a diagnosis of an active COVID-19 infection: 11 (52.4%) patients were hospitalised and 4 (19.1%) patients died. Conclusion(s): In a metropolitan area highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed fewer patients with HCC, and similar rates of treatment modification, but with a significantly longer treatment delay in 2020 vs. 2019. Lay summary: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era, fewer patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented to the multidisciplinary tumour board, especially with a first diagnosis of HCC. Patients with HCC had a treatment delay that was longer in the COVID-19 period than in 2019.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	"Activation of Melanocortin Receptors as a Potential Strategy to Reduce Local and Systemic Reactions Induced by Respiratory Viruses. The clinical hallmarks of infections caused by critical respiratory viruses consist of pneumonia, which can progress to acute lung injury (ALI), and systemic manifestations including hypercoagulopathy, vascular dysfunction, and endotheliitis. The disease outcome largely depends on the immune response produced by the host. The bio-molecular mechanisms underlying certain dire consequences of the infection partly arise from an aberrant production of inflammatory molecules, an event denoted as ""cytokine storm"". Therefore, in addition to antiviral therapies, molecules able to prevent the injury caused by cytokine excess are under investigation. In this perspective, taking advantage of melanocortin peptides and their receptors, components of an endogenous modulatory system that exerts marked anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory influences, could be an effective therapeutic strategy to control disease evolution. Exploiting the melanocortin system using natural or synthetic ligands can form a realistic basis to counteract certain deleterious effects of respiratory virus infections. The central and peripheral protective actions exerted following melanocortin receptor activation could allow dampening the harmful events that trigger the cytokine storm and endothelial dysfunction while sustaining the beneficial signals required to elicit repair mechanisms. The long standing evidence for melanocortin safety encourages this approach.© Copyright © 2020 Lonati, Gatti and Catania."	false
0	Association of Social and Economic Inequality With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties. Importance: It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population., Objective: To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association., Exposures: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed., Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates., Results: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19-related deaths per 100000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918)., Conclusions and Relevance: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.	false
0	Socioeconomic status determines COVID-19 incidence and related mortality in Santiago, Chile. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted dense urban populations particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality patterns, and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. We find that among all age groups, there is a strong association between socioeconomic status and both mortality -measured either by direct COVID-19 attributed deaths or excess deaths- and public health capacity. Specifically, we show that behavioral factors like human mobility, as well as health system factors such as testing volumes, testing delays, and test positivity rates are associated with disease outcomes. These robust patterns suggest multiple possibly interacting pathways that can explain the observed disease burden and mortality differentials: (i) in lower socioeconomic status municipalities, human mobility was not reduced as much as in more affluent municipalities; (ii) testing volumes in these locations were insufficient early in the pandemic and public health interventions were applied too late to be effective; (iii) test positivity and testing delays were much higher in less affluent municipalities, indicating an impaired capacity of the health-care system to contain the spread of the epidemic; and (iv) infection fatality rates appear much higher in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Together, these findings highlight the exacerbated consequences of health-care inequalities in a large city of the developing world, and provide practical methodological approaches useful for characterizing COVID-19 burden and mortality in other segregated urban centers.	false
0	Tele-ICUs for COVID-19: A Look at National Prevalence and Characteristics of Hospitals Providing Teleintensive Care. PURPOSE: Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of intensive care unit telemedicine (tele-ICUs) may be one mechanism to provide patient care, particularly in rural parts of the United States. The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHOD(S): We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states. Future work should continue the evaluation of tele-ICU effectiveness and, if favorable, explore the variation we identified for improved access to teleintensive care.Copyright © 2020 National Rural Health Association.	false
0	Development of a SARS-CoV-2-specific biosensor for antigen detection using scFv-Fc fusion proteins. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In a global pandemic, development of a cheap, rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use diagnostic test is necessary if we are to mount an immediate response to this emerging threat. Here, we report the development of a specific lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based biosensor for COVID-19. We used phage display technology to generate four SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific single-chain variable fragment-crystallizable fragment (scFv-Fc) fusion antibodies. The scFv-Fc antibodies bind specifically and with high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen, but not to NPs of other coronaviruses. Using these scFv-Fc antibodies, we screened three diagnostic antibody pairs for use on a cellulose nanobead (CNB)-based LFIA platform. The detection limits of the best scFv-Fc antibody pair, 12H1 as the capture probe and 12H8 as the CNB-conjugated detection probe, were 2 ng antigen protein and 2.5 x 10(4) pfu cultured virus. This LFIA platform detected only SARS-CoV-2 NP, not NPs from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or influenza H1N1. Thus, we have successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific rapid diagnostic test, which is expected to be a simple and rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19.	false
0	Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection Detected on F-18-FDG PET/CT Scan Done for Multiple Myeloma. A 69-year-old woman with multiple myeloma came to our department for F-18-FDG PET/CT scan for routine surveillance. The patient denied any history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or body aches. F-18-FDG PET/CT scan from vertex to knees was performed. PET/CT images revealed extensive peripheral ground-glass opacities showing intense FDG uptake (SUVmax 12) involving bilateral lower lobes. Possibility of an infective etiology including novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was raised. The patient's oropharyngeal swab for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction amplification test came back positive for COVID-19 infection. The patient and her husband were advised home quarantine for 14 days.	false
0	Standardization of a flow cytometry SARS-CoV-2 serologic test. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causing agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. The development of the humoral response to the virus has been the subject of intensive research and development. A flow cytometry-based assay using native full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in 293T cells was recently proposed as a complementary seropositivity determination assay. The aim of our study was to further develop the flow cytometry assay for potential use as a confirmatory test and to standardize its parameters and results for reliable inter-laboratory use. We have optimized the protocol, established the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and tested reproducibility using pre-COVID plasma samples and convalescent, SARS-CoV-2 individual plasma samples. The flow-based assay was simplified and standardized by cultivating the 293T cells in suspension and expressing results in Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF) using an internal antibody positive control. The ROC curve was determined with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and the assay specificity and sensitivity were established at 100% and 97.7% respectively. Reproducibility was good as determined on multiple cytometers, on different days, and with data acquisition as far as 72h post-staining. The optimized and standardized assay could be used as a high throughput confirmation confirmatory assay in flow cytometry laboratories involved in serological testing.	false
0	[How evaluate results of treatment in patients with COVID-19? Symptomatic Hospital and Outpatient Clinical Scale for COVID-19 (SHOCS-COVID)]. Aim Development of a novel scale for assessing medical state in patients with new coronavirus infection based on clinical and laboratory disease severity's markers, named SHOKS-COVID scale.Material and Methods Clinical Assessment Scale (SHOKS-COVID) is based on1: clinical parameters (respiratory rate, Body temperature, SpO2 need and type of ventilation support) 2: Inflammation markers (C reactive protein (CRP) and prothrombotic marker (D-dimer)) and 3: percent of lungs injury by CT. This scale was used in several clinical studies in patients with varying severity of the course of the COVID 19. SHOKS-COVID scale was also compared against some additional biomarkers and with length of hospital stay. Results In patients with severe COVID-19 (Clinical Trial WAYFARER - 34 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores were correlated with the degree of inflammation: CRP (r = 0.64; p <0.0001); the ratio lymphocytes / CRP (r = - 0.64; p <0.0001). Also, SHOKS-COVID score correlated with the D-dimer (r = 0.35; p <0.0001) and percentage lung damage on multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) - (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001) and length stay in the clinic (r = 0.57, p = 0.0009). In patients with mild course (BISQUIT Study - 103 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores had a statistically significant positive correlation with length of fever (r = 0.37; p = 0.0002) and length of stay in the clinic (r = 0.52, p <0.0001) and negatively correlated with the ratio of lymphocytes / CRP (-0.78, p <0.0001) and the level of CRP (r=0.78; p <0.0001). Patents were grouped based on severity of COVID 19 and median and interquartile range (IQR) of SHOCKS-COVID were measured in these groups. Median and IQR of SHOCKS-COVID were 2.00 [1.0-2.5] points in mild course, 4.0 points [3.0-5.0] in moderate course, 7.0 points [6.0-9.0] in moderately severe course,12.0 points [10.0-14.0] in severe course of disease and 15.0 points [14.5-15.5] in extremely severe patients. Conclusion Here we report a novel scale of COVID 19 disease progression. This scale ranges from zero in asymptomatic patients (with normal range of biomarkers and without lung damage on CT) to fifteen in extremely severe patients. The scores for SHOKS-COVID are increasing, in parallel with the deterioration of all other biomarkers of severity and prognosis in patients with new coronavirus infection. Based on the analysis carried out, we were able to determine values of SHOKS-COVID scale and levels of main clinical and laboratory markers in patients with different severity of COVID 19.	false
0	Proteinuria in COVID-19: prevalence, characterization and prognostic role. BACKGROUND: Proteinuria has been commonly reported in patients with COVID-19. However, only dipstick tests have been frequently used thus far. Here, the quantification and characterization of proteinuria were investigated and their association with mortality was assessed., METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single center study included 153 patients, hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 28th and April 30th, 2020, in whom total proteinuria and urinary alpha1-microglobulin (a marker of tubular injury) were measured. Association with mortality was evaluated, with a follow-up until May 7th, 2020., RESULTS: According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging, 14% (n = 21) of the patients had category 1 proteinuria (< 150 mg/g of urine creatinine), 42% (n = 64) had category 2 (between 150 and 500 mg/g) and 44% (n = 68) had category 3 proteinuria (over 500 mg/g). Urine alpha1-microglobulin concentration was higher than 15 mg/g in 89% of patients. After a median follow-up of 27 [14;30] days, the mortality rate reached 18%. Total proteinuria and urinary alpha1-microglobulin were associated with mortality in unadjusted and adjusted models. This association was stronger in subgroups of patients with normal renal function and without a urinary catheter., CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria is frequent in patients with COVID-19. Its characterization suggests a tubular origin, with increased urinary alpha1-microglobulin. Tubular proteinuria was associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our restropective, observational study.	false
0	Estimates of global SARS-CoV-2 infection exposure, infection morbidity, and infection mortality rates. We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and global proportions of respective populations that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess infection morbidity and mortality rates, factoring both documented and undocumented infections. The estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of the world’s population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific Region at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95% CI: 37.95-46.09%). The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections. Globally per 1,000 infections, the infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51), the infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18), the infection severity rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37), and the infection criticality rate was 2.26 (95% CI: 2.24-2.28). If left unchecked with no interventions, the pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18) deaths, 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acute-care hospitalizations, 33.01 million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million (95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) critical cases. The global population remains far below the herd immunity threshold and at risk of repeated waves of infection. Global epidemiology reveals immense regional variation in infection exposure and morbidity and mortality rates.	false
0	Development of spike receptor-binding domain nanoparticle as a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling H. pylori -bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. 16-20 months-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD-nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD-nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious viruses in nasal washes and lungs as well as viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study demonstrates the Spike RBD-nanoparticle as an effective protein vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus. Limited initial supply of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. Here, we used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20-49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults over 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. While maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.

0	Transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in Chile, March-October, 2020. Since the detection of the first case of COVID-19 in Chile on March 3rd, 2020, a total of 513,188 cases, including ~14,302 deaths have been reported in Chile as of November 2nd, 2020. Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chile's incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2nd, 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to maintain the epidemic under control.	false
0	Multi-organ damage by covid-19: congestive (cardio-pulmonary) heart failure, and blood-heart barrier leakage. Corona virus disease-19 (covid-19) is caused by a coronavirus that is also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is generally characterized by fever, respiratory inflammation, and multi-organ failure in susceptible hosts. One of the first things during inflammation is the response by acute phase proteins coupled with coagulation. The angiotensinogen (a substrate for hypertension) is one such acute phase protein and goes on to explain an association of covid-19 with that of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2, a metallopeptidase). Therefore, it is advisable to administer, and test the efficacy of specific blocker(s) of angiotensinogen such as siRNAs or antibodies to covid-19 subjects. Covid-19 activates neutrophils, macrophages, but decreases T-helper cells activity. The metalloproteinases promote the activation of these inflammatory immune cells, therefore; we surmise that doxycycline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor, and a safer antibiotic) would benefit the covid-19 subjects. Along these lines, an anti-acid has also been suggested for mitigation of the covid-19 complications. Interestingly, there are three primary vegetables (celery, carrot, and long-squash) which are alkaline in their pH-range as compared to many others. Hence, treatment with fresh juice (without any preservative) from these vegies or the antioxidants derived from purple carrot and cabbage together with appropriate anti-coagulants may also help prevent or lessen the detrimental effects of the covid-19 pathological outcomes. These suggested remedies might be included in the list of putative interventions that are currently being investigated towards mitigating the multi-organ damage by Covid-19 during the ongoing pandemic.	false
0	Clinical Significance of Cellular Immunity Function and Inflammatory Factors Assays in Alveolar Lavage Fluid for Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia. In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) and inflammatory factors (IL-6, HS-CRP and procalcitonin (PCT)) of alveolar lavage fluid in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and their clinical impact on the assessment of disease severity and prognosis. 24 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU of the Ezhou Central Hospital from February 1 to March 22, 2020. According to the 28-day prognosis, they were assigned to a death group and a survival group. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, peripheral blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected for examination of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory factors by flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. The CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cell counts in alveolar lavage fluid and serum were significantly higher in the survival group than those of the death group (P<0.05). The levels of IL-6, HS-CRP and PCT in alveolar lavage fluid and serum of the death group were statistically higher than those of the survival group (P<0.05); The CD3+, CD4+ cell count and IL-6 level were negatively correlated with SOFA and APACHE II scores, respectively (P<0.05). The CD4+ cell and SOFA score have a regression relationship with the prognosis of COVID-19 severe patients. The CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells and IL-6 levels are valuable in determining the prognosis of the severe COVID-19 pneumonia and are strongly correlated with the severity of the disease; the CD4+ cell is an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

0	A Streamlined Whole Blood CyTOF Workflow Defines A Circulating Immune Cell Signature of COVID-19. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) represents one of the most powerful tools in immune phenotyping, allowing high throughput quantification of over 40 parameters at single-cell resolution. However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining, and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We apply this workflow to characterize 184 whole blood samples collected longitudinally from a cohort of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, highlighting dynamic disease-associated changes in circulating immune cell frequency and phenotype.

0	Broad and potent activity against SARS-like viruses by an engineered human monoclonal antibody. The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures. We employed a directed evolution approach to engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) and neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with high potency. Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a distinct angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In immunocompetent mouse models of SARS and COVID-19, prophylactic administration of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate against clade 1 sarbecoviruses.

0	SARS-CoV-2 recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunity. The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.	false
0	Is extensive cardiopulmonary screening useful in athletes with previous asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection?. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to understand if and how to screen SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes to safely resume training and competitions. The aim of this study is to understand which investigations are useful in a screening protocol aimed at protecting health but also avoiding inappropriate examinations. METHOD(S): We conducted a cohort study of a professional soccer team that is based on an extensive screening protocol for resuming training during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included personal history, antigen swabs, blood tests, spirometry, resting/stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring, echocardiogram, Holter and chest CT. We also compared the findings with prior data from the same subjects before infection and with data from SARS-CoV-2-negative players. RESULT(S): None of the players had positive swab and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM class antibodies. Out of 30 players, 18 (60%) had IgG class antibodies. None had suffered severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease, 12 (66.7%) had complained of mild COVID-19-related symptoms and 6 (33.3%) were asymptomatic. None of the players we examined revealed significant cardiovascular abnormalities after clinical recovery. A mild reduction in spirometry parameters versus pre-COVID-19 values was observed in all athletes, but it was statistically significant (p<0.05) only in SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes. One SARS-CoV-2-positive player showed increased troponin I level, but extensive investigation did not show signs of myocardial damage. CONCLUSION(S): In this small cohort of athletes with previous asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive screening protocol including blood tests, spirometry, resting ECG, stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring and echocardiogram did not identify relevant anomalies. While larger studies are needed, extensive cardiorespiratory and haematological screening in athletes with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unnecessary.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	Clinical evaluation of commercial automated SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. Objective: Numerous immunoassays for detecting antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed and released. Validations of these have been performed with a limited number of samples. The lack of standardisation might lead to significantly different results. This study compared ten automated assays from six vendors in terms of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. Method(s): This study compared ten fully automated immunoassays from the following vendors: Diasorin, Epitope Diagnostics, Euroimmun, Roche, YHLO, and Snibe. The retrospective part of the study included patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and controls comprised patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was excluded. Furthermore, biobanked sera were taken as negative controls (n = 97). The retrospective part involved four groups: (1) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (n = 183); (1B) suspected COVID-19 infection (n = 167) without a qRT-PCR result but positive serological results from at least two different assays, and suspected COVID-19 infection due to a positive serological result from the Roche assay (n = 295); (2) biobanked sera obtained from patients before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 97) as negative controls; and (2A) probably COVID-19-negative sera with negative serological results from at least two different assays (n = 152). Result(s): Overall diagnostic sensitivities were: Euroimmun (IgA) 87%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgG) 83%; YHLO (IgG) 77%; Roche (IgM/IgG) 77%; Euroimmun (IgG) 75%; Diasorin (IgG) 53%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgM) 52%; Snibe (IgG) 47%; YHLO (IgM) 35%; and Snibe (IgM) 26%. Diagnostic specificities were: YHLO (IgG) 100%; Roche, 100%; Snibe (IgM/IgG) 100%; Diasorin (IgG) 97%; Euroimmun (IgG) 94%; YHLO (IgM) 94%; Euroimmun (IgA) 83%. Conclusion(s): Assays from different vendors substantially varied in terms of their performance. These findings might facilitate selection of appropriate serological assays.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	A strategy for SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma collection in a chilean nation-wide blood bank network. Background/Case Studies: With SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the potential use of convalescent plasma, most blood banks were forced to coordinate calling strategies, donor selection, and convalescent plasma production, with no new resources. The first infected patient in Chile was reported on March 03, 2020. The objective of this study is to describe our selection strategy and its efficiency. Study Design/Methods: The project was approved by the ethics committee. In our country, a multicentric nation-wide network of blood banks was created, with eight centers collecting convalescent plasma. A donor registration web site was created with volunteer inscription, which had specific questions that could result in an immediate deferral, and this web site was promoted on TV and in social media. After that phase, a brief telephonic survey was performed to schedule the date and hour for on-toone interviews, and select potential donors eligible for testing. They were tested for HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV I and II, Chagas disease and syphilis, NAT for HIV, HBV y HCV, anti HLA antibodies and anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all donors with less than 28 days since last symptoms. After all these studies, apheresis was indicated for selected donors. Results/Findings: From 5008 inscriptions on the web site, 21.1% were deferred automatically at the web site level. A total of 1165 volunteers were interviewed in our institution, and, from them, 25.8% were excluded after the questionnaire (73%) or because of poor venous access (27%). From the 864 accepted and tested volunteers, 0.9%were deferred because of microbiological studies, 22.6% for less than 1:320 antibodies titers. From 465 women tested, 26.6% were excluded for the presence of anti HLA antibodies. Finally, 536 donors were able to proceed with apheresis. Conclusion(s): The 46% from total volunteers were finally able to proceed to apheresis in our institution. The cooperative effort between institutions allowed us to start working within four weeks since the first case was reported in our country, with 444 effective apheresis performed over the course of 16 weeks.	false
0	Early postoperative outcomes among patients with delayed surgeries after preoperative positive test for SARS-CoV-2: A case-control study from a single institution. Background: There are limited data on surgical complications for patients that have delayed surgery after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes of patients submitted to surgery after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Asymptomatic patients that had surgery delayed after preoperative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were matched in a 1:2 ratio for age, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists to patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): About 1253 patients underwent surgical procedures and were subjected to screening for SARS-CoV-2. Forty-nine cases with a delayed surgery were included in the coronavirus disease (COVID) recovery (COVID-rec) group and were matched to 98 patients included in the COVID negative (COVID-neg) group. Overall, 22 (15%) patients had 30-days postoperative complications, but there was no statistically difference between groups -16.3% for COVID-rec and 14.3% for COVID-neg, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 1.17:95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-3.0; p =.74). Moreover, we did not find difference regarding grades more than or equal to 3 complication rates - 8.2% for COVID-rec and 6.1% for COVID-neg (OR 1.36:95%CI 0.36-5.0; p =.64). There were no pulmonary complications or SARS-CoV-2 related infection and no deaths within the 30-days after surgery. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that patients with delayed elective surgeries due to asymptomatic preoperative positive SARS-CoV-2 test are not at higher risk of postoperative complications.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 outbreak on emergency surgeries for occlusive colorectal cancers. Aim: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the CoV-19 outbreak, public health has been affected in several areas, especially, mortality from malignancies has increased. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) is the third-most common cause of cancer-related deaths across the world. The present study aimed to investigate the time of CRC patients' admission to hospital and its effects in the light of COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): We examined the case of 62 patients who visited our hospital emergency department with intestinal obstruction due to CRC between 2019 and 2020. We categorised the patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic as group 1 and the others as group 2. We comparatively evaluated the demographic data, complaints and duration, tumour characteristics, blood values, complications, mortality rates and the length of hospital stay of the patients. We noted that the duration of admission to the hospital was prolonged after the patients developed obstructive symptoms. Result(s): As incidences of nausea/vomiting became more frequent, the duration of admission to the hospital after the complaints began and the resultant mortality rate were statistically higher among the group 1 patients. The haematocrit (htc) value was lower and the tumour size was larger in the deceased patients. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 pandemic delayed the diagnosis of patients with colorectal cancer. The time that elapsed after occlusion in CRC increased the rate of mortality and morbidity. It was observed that, especially, mortality was higher for elderly patients with low htc values. This increase in the mortality rates suggests the importance of the time of admission to the hospital in case of obstructive CRC. We thus believe that it is essential to propagate that the hospitals are safe from COVID to encourage the public to avail hospital services for serious cases in order to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment.© Copyright 2020 by Turkish Society of Colon and Rectal Surgery	false

0	An evaluative study on financial risks and its implications on financial management strategies for Indian corporates. Covid 19 catastrophe has eventually stopped the functioning of Indian corporates and it has affected it to the core. The study is an empirical and quantitative study to evaluate the nature and prevalence of financial risks which are prevalent in Indian organizations. The study would also evaluate its implications on financial management strategies for Indian corporates. In this study Mixed research method is used which would be a combination of Exploratory, conclusive and action oriented research. The research method chosen for this study would be survey method with Questionnaire. For this study a sample of 100 senior managers, financial managers, accountants and auditors would be contacted who are working in India. Data analysis has been done using SPSS. It was found from this study that company rules and regulations led to more financial risks in Indian corporates. The government policies and procedures had very less influence on company's financial risks in India. It is concluded that companies must change their policies and procedures to reduce the prevalence of financial risks in their companies.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Life-threatening macrophage activation syndrome with fulminant myocarditis successfully rescued by high dose intravenous Anakinra. Introduction: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of some rheumatologic diseases1. Objective(s): We report the case of a child with systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) complicated by severe MAS and acute myocarditis, needing veno-arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA-ECMO), successfully rescued by high dose intravenous Anakinra (HDIV-ANA). Method(s): Case report's description Results: A two-year-old boy presented with one month history of fever associated with limping gait, cervical lymphadenopathy and skin rash. Laboratory tests showed elevation of inflammatory markers and ferritin. By exclusion criteria, sJIA was diagnosed and steroid therapy started. After a soft tissue bacterial infection, fever relapsed and laboratory tests were consistent with MAS (day 1): Hb 8.5 g/dL, PLT 44000/mm3; FDP 1522 ug/L, CRP 100 mg/L, ferritin 2200 ug/L. High doses intravenous metilprednisolone and oral Cyclosporin A (CSA) were started. On day 2 he presented a Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome and acute myocarditis. He was admitted into the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where intravenous immunoglobulin and subcutaneous Anakinra (ANA) were added. On day 4, due to an episode of cardiac arrest, VA-ECMO was started and we tried high dose intravenous ANA (HDIV-ANA, 8 mg/Kg/day q6h). This treatment brought immediate benefit: echocardiography showed progressive resolution of myocarditis so that VA-ECMO was definitely weaned off in six days. Laboratory test showed isolated neutropenia (PMNs 0-100/mm3). Suspecting a iatrogenic cause, HDIV-ANA was gradually reduced to the maintenance dose without benefit. On day 22, ANA was stopped and neutropenia resolved. Analysis of PRF1 gene revealed a mutation (c.[272C>T] p.[Ala91Val]) in heterozygosis. 49 days after admission he was discharged on oral prednisone and CSA. Neither neurological nor other organ consequences related to MAS were reported. A few months later, on tapering down of therapy, he relapsed. ANA was restarted with rapid improvement and no side effects, including neutropenia. Currently, after 12 months, the disease is in clinical remission on medication. Conclusion(s): MAS is a rare life-threatening complication of sJIA, triggered by infections in up to one-third of the patients 2. It is the result of a cytokine storm that lead to a dysregulated inflammatory activation of the immune system, with rapid progression to multiorgan failure. Treatment usually includes high dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Recently, the use of selective cytokine inhibitors has been suggested. No standardized guidelines are available to date, but the use of ANA has been already reported, pointing out the need for a higher doses regimen in refractory cases. MAS in our patient appeared after a soft tissue infection which could have act as triggering factor in a patient with sJIA and genetic predisposing pattern. The choice of intravenous administration of ANA was partly due to the generalized edema and partly to the severe discoaugulopathy. Considering the higher doses needed for rapidly suppressing the cytokine storm and ANA pharmacokinetics, we split the daily dose into four administrations. No major adverse events were reported, except for a transient neutropenia, already reported 6. Based on our experience, HDIV-ANA is a safe and effective treatment for refractory life-threatening sJIA-related MAS. This therapeutic approach may be also considered in the current pandemic COVID-19 emergency where recent evidence showed IL1-driven MAS-like complication triggered by SARS-COV-2 virus as predictor of bad outcome7.	false
0	Imaging Mass Cytometric Analysis of Postmortem Tissues Reveals Dysregulated Immune Cell and Cytokine Responses in Multiple Organs of COVID-19 Patients. SARS-coronavirus-2-induced immune dysregulation and inflammatory responses are involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, very little is known about immune cell and cytokine alterations in specific organs of COVID-19 patients. Here, we evaluated immune cells and cytokines in postmortem tissues, i.e., lungs, intestine, liver, kidneys, and spleen of three patients with COVID-19. Imaging mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19, natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs also infiltrated the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression was higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19 patients (compared to levels in controls). Collectively, these findings suggested that IL-10 and TNF-alpha as immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively,-might be prognostic and could serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.© Copyright © 2020 Wang, Xu, Wang, Pan, Zhang, Han, Huang, Wu, Yang, Yang, Yang, Shu, Zou, Li, Luo, Yao, Wang, Qiu, Wang, Zhang, Yao, Yan, Zhou and Shang.	false

0	COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies predict disease severity and survival. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and high anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels. Although anti-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics., Garcia-Beltran et al. show that the development of more potent neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection predicts COVID-19 survival. Protective antibody responses exhibit potent neutralization against the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 D614G spike variant but lack significant activity against pre-emergent WIV1-CoV spike, suggesting that convalescent patients are likely to remain susceptible to future pandemics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Relationship between myocardial injury, hypercoagulability and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19. Objective: To study the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) patients' serum myocardial injury markers, coagulation markers and inflammatory markers, and to explore their value in prognosis. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 67 patients with covid-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020. According to the severity of the disease, they were divided into general group (n=20), severe group (n=20) and critical group (n=27). According to the discharge condition of the patients, the patients were divided into cure group (n=12) and death group (n=15), and the end point of observation was patients' improvement and discharge or death during hospitalization. The clinical data of the patients were collected, the venous blood was collected and the serum levels of hs-cTnI, MYO, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, D-dimer, WBC, PT, APPT, FIB, hs-CRP and ferritin were detected. The differences of the above indexes were compared among the three groups. Results: There was no significant difference in Red Blood Cell, Platelet (PLT), FIB and hemoglobin among the three groups (P>0.05). However, the levels of WBC, hs-CRP, ferritin, PT, APPT and D-dimer in the normal group, the severe group and the critical recombination group were significantly different (P<0.05), and the critical recombination group was higher than that of the severe group and the ordinary group (P<0.05). NT-proBNP, CK-MB, MYO, hs-cTnI of critical patients were significantly higher than those of normal group and severe group, and pro BNP, CK-MB, MYO, hs-cTnI of death patients in critical severe group were higher than those of cured patients (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the increase of hs-cTnI (OR=1.053, 95%CI 1.010-1.098, P=0.016) and D-dimer (OR=1.253, 95%CI 1.026-1.531, P=0.005) were the risk factors of death in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 critical and severe patients were accompanied with coagulation dysfunction and the increase of inflammatory factors. There were different degrees of myocardial injury, and the increase of hs-cTnI and D-dimer are the risk factors of death in patients with severe COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Chinese Medical Association	false
0	Slaying SARS-CoV-2 One (Single-domain) Antibody at a Time. Camelid-derived and synthetic single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are emerging as potent weapons against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. sdAbs are small, compact, thermostable immunoglobulin elements capable of binding targets with subnanomolar affinities. By leveraging the power of phage- and yeast surface-display technologies, rare sdAbs can be isolated from highly diverse and complex antibody libraries. Once in hand, sdAbs can be engineered to improve binding affinity, avidity, target specificities, and biodistribution. In this Opinion piece we highlight a series of sophisticated studies describing the identification of ultrapotent sdAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. We discuss the possible applications of these antibodies in the global fight against COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Commentary: Should all cancer patients be tested for COVID-19 before each chemotherapy cycle?. Cancer patients under active chemotherapy are more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). There are still some controversies regarding routine polymerase chain reaction testing of asymptomatic cancer patients before chemotherapy cycles. Despite a lack of data, Al-Shamsi et al. showed higher COVID-19 positivity rate among asymptomatic cancer patients. Furthermore, mortality rate was higher in this group of patients. There is no high evidence-based recommendation from the cancer societies for testing asymptomatic patients before each chemotherapy cycle. In this commentary, we assessed the current publications and guidelines regarding this issue.	false
0	COVID-19 and Myocardial Injury in a Brazilian ICU: High Incidence and Higher Risk of In-Hospital Mortality. BACKGROUND: The incidence of myocardial injury (MI) in patients with COVID-19 in Brazil and the prognostic impact of MI have not been elucidated., OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of MI in patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify variables associated with its occurrence. The secondary objective was to assess high-sensitivity troponin I as a predictor of in-hospital mortality., METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between March and April 2020 with cases of confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Numerical variables were compared by using Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed with variables associated with MI and p<0.2 to determine predictors of MI. The ROC curve was used to determine the troponin value capable of predicting higher in-hospital mortality. Survival functions were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method from the cut-off point indicated in the ROC curve., RESULTS: This study assessed 61 patients (63.9% of the male sex, mean age of 66.1+/-15.5 years). Myocardial injury was present in 36% of the patients. Systemic arterial hypertension (HAS) [OR 1.198; 95%CI: 2.246-37.665] and body mass index (BMI) [OR 1.143; 95%CI: 1.013-1.289] were independent risk predictors. High-sensitivity troponin I >48.3 ng/mL, which was determined in the ROC curve, predicts higher in-hospital mortality [AUC 0.786; p<0.05]. Survival in the group with high-sensitivity troponin I >48.3 ng/mL was lower than that in the group with values <=48.3 ng/dL [20.3 x 43.5 days, respectively; p<0.05]., CONCLUSION: There was a high incidence of MI in severe COVID-19 with impact on higher in-hospital mortality. The independent risk predictors of MI were SAH and BMI. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0).	false
0	A case of area postrema variant of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a disabling autoimmune astrocytopathic channelopathy, characterized by the presence of pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channels. Several viral infections including HIV, influenza virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein Barr virus, among others, have been alleged to trigger NMOSD in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have been ever evolving and the spectrum of neuraxial involvement is broadening. Albeit it may affect any area of the neural axis, the involvement of the spinal cord is rare compared to that of the brain and of the peripheral nervous system. Cases with acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) have been recently reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection but did not fulfill the international consensus diagnostic criteria for NMOSD. AQP-4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD following SARS-CoV-2 infection had not yet been reported. We herein report a novel case of a previously healthy man who presented with a clinical picture of bouts of vomiting and hiccoughs (area postrema syndrome), which rapidly evolved to acute LETM, all following SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was finally diagnosed to be a case of seropositive NMOSD which presented as area postrema syndrome. The response to immunomodulatory drugs was excellent.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	A fatal outcome from SARS-CoV-2 infection: One case report of a young man with multiple organ damage. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China on December 2019 and has become a severe public health issue worldwide. A 36-year-old man was presented to the hospital staff with a fever that had already persisted for a three-day period, general weakness and diarrhea. He had no chronic diseases and was tested positive for COVID-19 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid. During his hospitalization, several abnormal indicators appeared in his laboratory tests, which implied systemic inflammation and multiple organ damage. A series of chest radiographs monitored the dynamic process of lung lesions, which could predict the clinical changes of the patient. His condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in death due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on hospital day 13. The case indicates that inflammatory response may appear in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may lead to multiple organ damage (especially pancreatic damage). When a COVID-19 patient is entering into the critical stage, their condition could rapidly deteriorate.Copyright © 2021 Beijing You&apos;an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University	false
0	A highly thermotolerant, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain derivative elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies. The Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We fused our previously described, highly thermotolerant glycan engineered monomeric RBD to a heterologous non-immunogenic trimerization domain derived from cartilage matrix protein. The protein was expressed at a good yield of ∼80-100 mg/liter in Expi293 cells, as well as in both CHO and HEK293 stable cell lines. The designed trimeric RBD was observed to form homogeneous disulfide-linked trimers. When lyophilized, the trimer possessed remarkable functional stability to transient thermal stress of upto 100 °C and was stable to long term storage of over 4 weeks at 37 °C. Two immunizations with an AddaVax adjuvanted formulation elicited antibodies with high endpoint neutralizing titers against replicative virus with geometric mean titers of ∼1114 and 1940 in guinea pigs and mice respectively. In pseudoviral assays, corresponding titers were ∼3600 and ∼16050, while the corresponding value for human convalescent sera was 137. Similar results were obtained with an Alhydrogel, CpG combination adjuvant. The same immunogen was expressed in Pichia pastoris , but this formed high molecular weight aggregates and elicited much lower ACE2 competing antibodies than mammalian cell expressed protein. The excellent thermotolerance, high yield, and robust immunogenicity of such trimeric RBD immunogens suggest that they are a promising modality to combat COVID-19. <h4>Importance</h4> SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The viral surface exposed Spike glycoprotein is the target of neutralizing antibodies of which a major fraction targets the receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus RBD derived immunogens are attractive vaccine candidates. Monomeric, mammalian cell expressed RBD protein elicits low to moderate titers of neutralizing antibodies. We designed a highly expressed, trimeric RBD derivative with a non-immunogenic trimerization domain. In guinea pigs and mice respectively, this derivative induces 20-300 fold higher neutralizing antibody titers relative to convalescent human sera, while remaining conformationally intact after incubation for over four weeks at 37 °C and for ninety minutes at 100 °C when lyophilized. Such trimeric RBD formulations should not require a cold chain. Additionally, the high titers of neutralizing antibodies should buffer against viral sequence variation. These are both highly desirable attributes for a COVID-19 vaccine, especially in resource limited settings.	false
0	"Community pharmacist's professional adaptation amid Covid-19 emergency: a national survey on Italian pharmacists. Background Italy has been the first non-Asian country affected by Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Community pharmacies are essential services authorized to continue their activity during the emergency. To date, a clear image is lacking of the critical issues Italian community pharmacists had to face and of how they responded in their daily work.. Objective To describe procedures and critical logistical-organizational issues encountered by Italian community pharmacists and to collect the main requests reported by patients to pharmacists. Setting A national survey on Italian community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey using a reasoned questionnaire was sent during the pandemic peak to Italian pharmacies, divided in two groups according to the incidence of COVID-19: ""Red Zones"" and ""non-Red Zones"". Main outcome measure Exploring the most frequently adopted measures by the pharmacists. Results 169 community Pharmacists answered the questionnaire. The most frequently adopted measures were the use of gloves, surgical masks and protective barriers at the drug counter. Most implemented services for customers were: booking of prescriptions, delivery of medications and implementation of phone consultations. Overall, the questionnaire highlighted an increase in the number of health-related consultations and requests by customers. In Red Zones, there was a higher use of FFP2 and FFP3 masks by pharmacists, where customers were mainly interested in gaining information about specific classes of medications. Conclusion Community pharmacists adapted to lockdown measures by implementing a number of measures. There was an overall increase in pharmacists' personal protective equipment in Red Zones possibly linked to increased risk perception."	false
0	EGFR-Targeted Metal Chelating Polymers (MCPs) Harboring Multiple Pendant PEG2K Chains for MicroPET/CT Imaging of Patient-Derived Pancreatic Cancer Xenografts. In this study, we developed a new generation of metal chelating polymer (MCP) reagents that carry multiple polyethylene glycol (PEG) pendant groups to provide stealth to MCP-based radioimmunoconjugates (RICs). We describe the MCP synthesis for covalent attachment to panitumumab F(ab')2 fragments (pmabF(ab')2) in which different numbers of pendant methoxy-PEG chains [M = 2000, ~45 ethylene glycol (EG) repeat units, referred to as PEG2K] are incorporated into the polymer backbone. The pendant PEG2K chains were designed to provide a protein-repellant corona so that metal chelators attached closer to the polymer backbone will be less apparent to the physiological environment. DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) groups to chelate 64Cu were installed on these conjugates to be employed for PET imaging. The conjugation of MCPs to pmabF(ab')2 was based on a UV quantifiable bis-aromatic hydrazone formation under mild conditions (pH 5-6) between an aromatic aldehyde introduced on epsilon-NH2 groups of lysines in the F(ab')2 fragments and a hydrazinonicotinamide (HyNic) group installed on the initiating end of the MCP. Three MCPs with 17 polyglutamide (PGlu) repeat units, DOTA chelators and with an average of 2, 4, and 8 pendant PEG2K chains were studied to examine their in vitro and in vivo characteristics, as well as their potential for PET/CT imaging. A pmabF(ab')2-MCP conjugate carrying 2 PEG2K and one carrying 8 PEG2K pendant chains in the polymer were selected for microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing mice. Orthotopic pancreatic patient-derived xenografts tumors were visualized by PET/CT imaging. These RICs showed low levels of liver and spleen uptake along with even lower levels of kidney uptake. These encouraging results confirm the stealth properties of the MCPs with pendant PEG2K chains.	false
0	The Spectrum of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients With Coronavirus Disease-19: Predictors, Relationship With Disease Severity, and Outcome. INTRODUCTION: We prospectively studied the frequency, spectrum, and predictors of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and the relationship between GI symptoms and the severity and outcome., METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19, diagnosed in a university hospital referral laboratory in northern India, were evaluated for clinical manifestations including GI symptoms, their predictors, and the relationship between the presence of these symptoms, disease severity, and outcome on univariate and multivariate analyses., RESULTS: Of 16,317 subjects tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in their oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs during April-May 2020, 252 (1.5%) were positive. Of them, 208 (82.5%) were asymptomatic; of the 44 symptomatic patients, 18 (40.9%) had non-GI symptoms, 15 (34.1%) had a combination of GI and non-GI symptoms, and 11 (25.0%) had GI symptoms only. Thirty-three had mild-to-moderate disease, 8 severe, and 5 critical. Five patients (1.98%) died. On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the presence of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history and presence of non-GI symptoms and comorbid illnesses. Patients with GI synptoms more often had severe, critical illness and fatal outcome than those without GI symptoms., DISCUSSION: Eighty-two percent of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic, and 10.3% had GI symptoms; severe and fatal disease occurred only in 5% and 2%, respectively. The presence of GI symptoms was associated with a severe illness and fatal outcome on multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history, presence of non-GI symptoms, and comorbid illnesses.(Equation is included in full-text article.).	false

0	Successful treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammatory syndrome with tocilizumab. As of 28 October 2020, there are over 44 000 000 confirmed COVID-19 infections and over 1 000 000 deaths worldwide, including 945 367 infections and 45 765 deaths in the UK. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 50% of patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a surge of cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Here we describe the case of the first patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, in the UK. Early treatment (after 7-10 days from the onset of symptoms) with tocilizumab could (1) reduce the risk of requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation; (2) offer a chance of survival to people who are not fit for escalation or have refused to be ventilated; and (3) potentially increase the chance of survival in some patients who are already ventilated but fail to improve with supportive treatment.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

0	Development of a blood inventory management dashboard for inventory and usage monitoring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Background/Case Studies: One of the essential tasks of operating a transfusion medicine service is the management of blood inventory. In response to the uncertainty in blood use and blood supply brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, a Blood Inventory Management Dashboard (BIMD) for the University Hospitals Healthcare System (UHHS) was developed and implemented. Study Design/Methods: A multidisciplinary working group consisting of blood bank medical directors, laboratory managers, and information technology specialists were involved in the design of the BIMD. Hospital IT resources were prioritized to develop the dashboard. The dashboard informatics design pulls data from our blood bank information system (HCLL version 2015, SP1, WellSky (pka Mediware) (Overland Park, KS)). Reports are then generated using Microsoft SQL ServerData Tools 2015 (Redmond, WA). Data elements include: available blood components, total number of uncrossmatched red blood cells (RBC) divided based on ABO group and Rh type, patients who are high-volume users, and number of blood components issued and used. Inventory was trended over 7 and 30 days and graphically displayed. As a refinement, the dashboard was modified to display color coded inventory per level status (adequate, guarded, and critical). The dashboard display is configured in a tabular and graphical format via Microsoft Excel 2016 (Redmond, WA). Results/Findings: Beginning on March 22, 2020, the dashboard has been automatically distributed prior to 8 AM daily via email to the health system Incident Command Center, Blood Bank medical directors, and other organizational leadership. It immediately became a crucial tool for planning and served as a mechanism to identify the need to move blood inventory throughout the system over the course of the pandemic and permitting identification of high volume users for interventions of ordering additional inventory based on anticipated needs. The number of blood component units are now tracked across all the hospitals within our system. The breakout by ABO and Rh type is a novel and valuable feature of the dashboard and presents valuable summary data that are not available in the laboratory information system. Conclusion(s): The development of an automated dashboard enables monitoring blood inventory levels across a multiple-hospital health system. The dashboard provides data broken down by ABO and Rh type, data not readily retrievable in the laboratory information system. The dashboard provides tracking of blood product utilization, and the ability to respond dynamically to blood needs throughout the system over the course of the pandemic. The BIMD has proven to be a key tool to inform decision making by organizational and blood bank leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic and in developing future contingency plans in managing blood bank inventory during unforeseen emergencies.	false
0	Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Socio-demographics, Co-Morbidity and Past Experience of Racial Discrimination. <h4>Importance</h4> Immunization programs are only successful when there are high rates of acceptance and coverage. While delivering billions of COVID 19 doses globally addressing vaccine hesitancy will be one of the most significant public health communication efforts ever undertaken. <h4>Objective</h4> The goal of this study is to explore predictors of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, risk perception, and experience of discrimination, in a sample of the U.S. population. <h4>Design</h4> We used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020. <h4>Setting</h4> The survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA. <h4>Participants</h4> Respondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution. <h4>Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)</h4> Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy). <h4>Results</h4> Responses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. The majority were in the age category between 25 and 44 years (66%), male (53%), and working in the healthcare sector (61%). Most were White and non-Hispanic (66%) respondents followed by Black non-Hispanic (14%) and Hispanic (8%) respondents. Experience with racial discrimination was a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting racial discrimination having 21% increased odds of being at a higher level of hesitancy compared to those who did not report such experience (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.45). <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> Communication and logistical aspects during the COVID 19 vaccination campaign need to be sensitive to individuals past-experience of discrimination by identifying appropriate channels of communication and sites for vaccine distribution to reach those who may have sentiments of mistrust in the vaccination campaign.	false

Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients., RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD. Among the subset of patients who benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluations, there were 75 anosmic, 43 hyposmic and 113 normosmic patients. The prevalence of anosmia significantly decreased with the severity of the disease. Anosmia or hyposmia were not associated with any nasal disorder, according to SNOT-22., CONCLUSION: OD and GD are more prevalent in patients with mild COVID-19 compared with individuals with moderate, severe or critical diseases. Females might have a higher risk of developing OD and GD compared with males.	false

0	Efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma with amotosalen and ultraviolet a light treatment. Background/Case Studies: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in January 2020 as the responsible agent for COVID-19. First recognized in late 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic developed into a pandemic with, as of July 23, 2020, more than 15 million cases and 600,000 deaths reported globally. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood samples and blood components from asymptomatic blood donors including frozen plasma units and platelet concentrates. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a potential bloodborne pathogen and pathogen reduction offers potential to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission. We investigated the efficacy of amotosalen/UVA light to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma. Study Design/Methods: Five pools of whole-blood derived human plasma units (630-650 mL each) were inoculated with a local clinical isolate (SARS-CoV-2/ human/SAU/85791C/2020) with a 1:100 dilution. Spiked pools were used to evaluate the efficacy of amotosalen/ UVA treatment (INTERCEPT Blood System, Cerus Corporation, Concord, U.S.A.) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in plasma. Infectious and genomic viral titers were assessed by plaque assay and quantitative PCR (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), respectively, in spiked and treated samples in parallel with positive and negative controls. Results/Findings: Treatment of spiked plasma (titer of the viral stock: 5.6+/-0.2 log10 pfu/mL) with amotosalen/ UVA light resulted in complete inactivation of infectious viral titer with mean log reduction of >3.3+/-0.2 log10 pfu/mL. No viral replication or cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in cells inoculated with inactivated samples even after 9 days of incubation and three successive passages. Evaluation of genomic titer expressed in genome equivalent (GEq/mL) in inactivated samples showed equivalent reduction to the limit of detection of 7.10+/-0.2 log10 GEq/mL. Conclusion(s): Complete and efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 was observed with amotosalen/UVA light treatment of spiked human plasma units suggesting that treatment of plasma with this pathogen reduction technology could reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with prior inactivation data with amotosalen/UVA for other human-pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) in platelets and plasma.	false
0	Impact of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Spike variant on neutralisation potency of sera from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant now seen in 50 countries. In addition, many countries are extending the interval between doses of vaccine is being extended in order to expand vaccine coverage. It is unclear whether real world neutralising antibody titres will follow those in clinical trials, particularly in elderly persons, and how this will be impacted by mutations in strains such as B1.1.7. Here we tested immune responses in patients 3 weeks following the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2. We also tested neutralising antibody responses against pseudoviruses expressing wild type Spike proteins or expressing 3 key mutations present in B.1.1.7 (deletion 69/70, N501Y, A570D). IgG Spike antibody titres correlated well with neutralisation. We observed a range of neutralisation titres against wild type, with geometric mean titre (GMT) of 24. The vaccine sera exhibited a range of inhibitory dilutions giving 50% neutralisation (ID50) from <1:4 to 3449. However a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved threshold neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 years old (8/15 versus 8/8 P=0.052) after the first dose. Neutralisation titres were not significantly impacted by the combination of three Spike mutations tested, but were reduced against the full set of Spike mutations present in the B.1.1.7 variant. The highest fold change was approxiamately 6 and the median fold change for the B.1.1.7 variant versus wild type was 3.85 (IQR 2.68-5.28). Further work is needed to establish the impact of these observations on real life vaccine efficacy.	false
0	Symptoms and Clinical Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Outpatient Setting. Because most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not severe, understanding the epidemiology of mild cases has important clinical implications. We aimed to describe the symptom profile and associated outcomes in a virtual outpatient COVID-19 clinic. We conducted a prospective cohort study from March through June 2020. We included 106 patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, followed up until they had 2 sequential negative tests. Exploratory regression analyses identified potential prognostic symptoms or risk factors associated with outcomes, including emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and time to resolution of viral shedding. The mean (range) patient age was 51 (18-86) years, 50% were men, and 36.5% had at least 1 risk factor, most commonly asthma (16%) and diabetes (10%). Most patients (98.1%) had symptoms-cough (80.4%), fatigue (67.6%), fever (66.0%), headache (49.0%), and ageusia (46.9%). Nine (8.5%) patients were admitted to the ED, 5 (4.7%) were hospitalized, and none died. Asthma (RR = 7.13, P = .001) and being immunocompromised (RR = 3.44, P = .03) were associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes. Asthma (HR = 0.56, P = .04) and early symptoms of ageusia (HR= 0.50, P = .01) or myalgia (HR = 0.63, P = .04) were associated with significantly longer duration of viral shedding. In contrast to reports about severe cases of COVID-19, we found a higher incidence of sinus symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia and a lower incidence of fever, anosmia, and ageusia among our mild/moderate cases. Asthma and immunocompromised status were associated with adverse outcomes, and asthma and early symptoms of ageusia or myalgia with significantly longer duration of viral shedding.

0	Mapping SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Epitopes in COVID-19 Patients with a Multi-Coronavirus Protein Microarray. The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated research and development for controlling the pandemic. A multi-coronavirus protein microarray was created containing full-length proteins, overlapping protein fragments of varying lengths and peptide libraries from SARS-CoV-2 and four other human coronaviruses. Sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multi-coronavirus arrays to identify specific antibody reactivity. High level IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M and N, as well as accessory proteins, of SARS-CoV-2 were observed that was specific to COVID-19 patients. Overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses. The multi-coronavirus protein microarray is a useful tool for mapping antibody reactivity in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Systemic Racism, the Government’s Pandemic Response, and Racial Inequities in COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal and state governments have ignored racial and ethnic minorities&rsquo; unequal access to employment and health care that results in racial inequities in COVID-19 infections and deaths. In addition, they have enacted laws that further exacerbate these inequities. Consequently, many racial and ethnic minorities are employed in low-wage essential jobs that lack paid sick leave and health insurance. This lack of benefits causes them to go to work even when they are sick and prevents them from receiving appropriate medical treatment. As a result, racial and ethnic minorities have disproportionately been infected and died from COVID-19. Although these actions seem race &ldquo;neutral,&rdquo; they exemplify systemic racism. Racial and ethnic minorities are deemed inferior to white people, and thus they do not receive the same access to resources, such as employment and health care. This essay illustrates how systemic racism has resulted in racial inequities in COVID-19 infections and deaths through case studies in employment and health care. Using the health justice framework, it concludes with suggestions to eradicate systemic racism, redress harm, and engage community in implementing an equitable pandemic response.	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes in a cohort of early psychosis patients. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes, we used data from Electronic Health Records from 128 patients receiving care at a First Episode Psychosis clinic., METHODS: Rates of admission or emergency room (ER) visits from January 2020 to July 2020 were analysed using difference-in-difference regression. We used the same weeks in 2019 to control for seasonality., RESULTS: We found 17 hospitalizations or ER visits between 1 January 2020 and 13 March 2020 (incidence rate: 71.4 events/1000 person-weeks) and 6 between 14 March 2020 and 20 June 2020 (incidence rate: 18.5 events/1000 person-weeks) for an incidence rate ratio of 0.26. The severity of presentation worsened after transition to telemedicine. No signs of significant interruptions of care were found., CONCLUSIONS: We report that patients have avoided accessing higher levels of care, except in extreme cases. We argue that this is not a sustainable trajectory and that public health actions are required. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	false
0	Orthogonal immunoassays for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens reveal that immune response lasts beyond 4 mo post illness onset. Immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the current pandemic remains a field of immense interest and active research worldwide. Although the severity of acute infection may depend on the intensity of innate and adaptive immunity, leading to higher morbidity and mortality, the longevity of IgG antibodies, including neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2, is viewed as a key correlate of immune protection. Amid reports and concern that there is a rapid decay of IgG antibody levels within 1 mo to 2 mo after acute infection, we set out to study the pattern and duration of IgG antibody response to various SARS-CoV-2 antigens in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in a community setting. Herein, we show the correlation of IgG anti-spike protein S1 subunit, receptor binding domain, nucleocapsid, and virus neutralizing antibody titers with each other and with clinical features such as length and severity of COVID-19 illness. More importantly, using orthogonal measurements, we found the IgG titers to persist for more than 4 mo post symptom onset, implying that long-lasting immunity to COVID-19 from infection or vaccination might be observed, as seen with other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome.

0	Clinical validation of a second generation anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM automated chemiluminescent immunoassay. OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven to be extremely contagious and has spread rapidly all over the world. A key aspect in limiting the virus diffusion is to ensure early and accurate diagnosis. Serological assays could be an alternative in increasing testing capabilities, particularly when used as part of an algorithmic approach combined with molecular analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a second generation chemiluminescent automated immunoassay able to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies METHODS: Data are carried out on healthy subjects and other infectious diseases pre-pandemic sera, as controls, and on two different Covid-19 hospitalized patient groups (early and late infection time). Data obtained have been analyzed in terms of precision, linearity, sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: Specificities are: 100% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, in all patient groups. Sensitivities are: 97%, 100% and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 87%, 83% and 86% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the early infection, in the late infection and in the total patient group, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The Mindray anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, indicating that IgG and IgM simultaneous detection is useful even in the early phases of infection.

0	The Role of Justicia Adhatoda as prophylaxis for COVID-19 - Analysis based on docking study. Coronavirus cause severe harm to the health of both humans as well as animals, creating a major global health problem affecting millions of populations. Considering situational emergency of identifying novel targeted therapy, we have chosen herbal compound Adathoda justice/ vasica which is high potent olden vital compound having key role in various respiratory conditions with multiple beneficial uses. Adathoda is promoted and supported by the Ministry of AYUSH for symptomatic management of respiratory ailments in case of COVID 19. In this study, we focused Adathoda primary active alkaloid vasicine efficacy against coronavirus infectious symptoms, evaluated by in Silico screening studies on virus proteins ACE 2 Receptor, 3CL protease and Spike protein SARS HR1 motif using PyRx tool and AutoDoc 1.5.6. Based on PyRx results, Vasicine with ACE 2 Receptor shown higher docking affinity score -7.1 K/cal respectively when compared to other virus proteins. AutoDoc 1.5.6 screening study report showed that vasicine promotes good inhibitory constant 486.54 mM on 3CL protease more than others. Results reveal that the vasicine could be a potential target for the treatment of COVID 19. This study adds strong evidence to the claim by the advisory released by AYUSH. Based on the results with available literature Adathoda could be a drug helpful in relieving symptoms in non COVID cases those who were quarantined or in lockdown pace thereby reducing pandemic panic and in confirmed asymptomatic or mild cases. For usage in moderate to severe cases this could be an add on therapy with existing modern medical therapy.

0	Rapid protection from COVID-19 in nonhuman primates vaccinated intramuscularly but not intranasally with a single dose of a recombinant vaccine. The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> VSV vaccine protects NHPs from COVID-19 in 10 days	false
0	Time and the etiology of Acute Kidney Injury define prognosis in the course of COVID-19. Aim Kidneys are among the affected organs in COVID-19 and there may be different etiologies resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI) in different stages of the disease. This study aimed to analyze AKI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to the time and etiologies of AKI. <h4>Methods: </h4> 1056 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis in our institution were retrospectively evaluated and 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-nine patients who developed AKI were involved in the final analysis. Patients were classified into three groups, those who had AKI on admission, those who developed AKI in the first week and those who developed AKI starting from 7 th day. Initial lymphocyte counts, creatinine levels, electrolytes, acid-base status and changes in the inflammatory markers were compared between the groups. A comparison between patients who survived and who died was also performed. <h4>Result: </h4> s AKI had 24% mortality in COVID-19 patients who had eGFRs of over 60 ml/min/1,73 m 2 . Patients who developed AKI later had higher peak CRP and D-dimer levels with lower nadir lymphocyte counts (p=0,000, 0,004 and 0,003 respectively). Mortality of patients who had AKI on hospital admission (13%) was similar to the overall COVID-19 mortality for inpatients, however it was 44% for those who developed AKI after 7 th day. Early AKI was related to pre-renal causes and had a milder course. However, later AKIs were more related to immunologic response and had significantly higher mortality. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> AKI in COVID-19 is not of one kind. When developed, AKI should be evaluated in conjunction with the disease stage and possible etiologies. AKI that develops later has a worse prognosis.	false
0	Native-like SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expressed by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine. Vaccine development against the SARS-CoV-2 virus focuses on the principal target of the neutralizing immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines offer an effective platform for the delivery of viral antigen, but it is important for the generation of neutralizing antibodies that they produce appropriately processed and assembled viral antigen that mimics that observed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we describe the structure, conformation and glycosylation of the S protein derived from the adenovirus-vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine. We demonstrate native-like post-translational processing and assembly, and reveal the expression of S proteins on the surface of cells adopting the trimeric prefusion conformation. The data presented here confirms the use of ChAdOx1 adenovirus vectors as a leading platform technology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.	false
0	Clinical sequelae of COVID-19 survivors in Wuhan, China: a single-centre longitudinal study. Objectives: To describe the prevalence, nature and risk factors for the main clinical sequelae in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors who have been discharged from the hospital for more than 3 months. Method(s): This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. Result(s): Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0-62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0-102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela. A history of pulse >=90 bpm during hospitalization was associated with resting heart rate increase in convalescence. The duration of virus shedding after COVID-19 onset and hospital length of stay were longer in survivors with physical decline/fatigue or postactivity polypnoea than in those without. Conclusion(s): Clinical sequelae during early COVID-19 convalescence were common; some of these sequelae might be related to gender, age and clinical characteristics during hospitalization.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false
0	Development of a large spontaneous pneumothorax after recovery from mild COVID-19 infection. A previously healthy 37-year-old man presented with fevers and myalgias for a week with a minimal dry cough. Initial SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing was negative, but in light of high community prevalence, he was diagnosed with COVID-19, treated with supportive care and self-quarantined at home. Three days after resolution of all symptoms, he developed sudden onset chest pain. Chest imaging revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax and patchy subpleural ground glass opacities. IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. His pneumothorax resolved after placement of a small-bore chest tube, which was removed after 2 days. This case demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 can develop a significant pulmonary complication, a large pneumothorax, despite only minimal lower respiratory tract symptoms and after resolution of the original illness. Medical professionals should consider development of a pneumothorax in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and present with new respiratory symptoms.

0	Disease severity-specific neutrophil signatures in blood transcriptomes stratify COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently leading to increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients all over the world. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system., METHODS: In order to dissect COVID-19-driven immune host responses, we performed RNA-seq of whole blood cell transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis. Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the distinction from COVID-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates based on finding from data-driven findings., RESULTS: Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 16 COVID-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for COVID-19 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of disease severity.	false
0	Knowledge, attitude, and preventive behaviors of Hormozgan residents toward COVID-19, one month after the epidemic in Iran. Aim: COVID-19 has become prevalent in the world since December 2019. The further prevalence of the disease can be prevented by correct management of society and increasing knowledge, practices, and attitudes of the people. The present research aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors of people in Hormozgan in the south of Iran toward COVID-19., Subject and methods: The present cross-sectional research was conducted over 2 months (March 2020-April 2020). The online questionnaire comprised four sections: demographic information, knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward COVID-19. Knowledge included 36 items, attitude eight items, and behavior ten items. The collected data were analyzed statistically using SPSS ver. 22. The split-half method was used to test the reliability of knowledge and the estimated value was 0.84. That of attitude and behavior was estimated via Cronbach's alpha and was found to be 0.81 and 0.75, respectively., Results: A total number of 2024 participants with an average age of 33.94 years took part in this research. Of all participants, 64.4% were female. According to the results, 65.8% enjoyed a good level of knowledge and 34.2% enjoyed an average level. In addition, 63.2% demonstrated a good attitude and 36.8% an average level. A large percentage of participants (90.6%) had good practices and only 9.4% had an average level of practices., Conclusion: The present findings show that participants had a relatively good level of knowledge, positive attitude, and good behavior concerning COVID-19.

0	Increases in exposure calls related to selected cleaners and disinfectants at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: data from Canadian poison centres. Little is known about the use or misuse of cleaning products during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compiled data from January to June in 2019 and 2020 from Canadian poison centres, and report on calls regarding selected cleaning products and present year-overyear percentage change. There were 3408 (42%) calls related to bleaches; 2015 (25%) to hand sanitizers; 1667 (21%) to disinfectants; 949 (12%) to chlorine gas; and 148 (2%) to chloramine gas. An increase in calls occurred in conjunction with the onset of COVID-19, with the largest increase occurring in March. Timely access to Canadian poison centre data facilitated early communication of safety messaging for dissemination to the public.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 infected diabetic patients admitted in ICUs of the southern region of Bangladesh. Background and aims: Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent among critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with poor outcomes. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the southern region of Bangladesh. Method(s): Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups. Result(s): The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51-70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group. Conclusion(s): Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the prevention and prompt treatment of diabetic patients, to maintain good glycaemic control especially those who require insulin therapy.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India	false
0	Determining the effect of postage on the recovery of cystic fibrosis pathogens from respiratory samples. Objectives: Regular microbiological surveillance of sputum to detect pathogens is a cornerstone of CF care. In many CF centres, patients may be required to post samples to the clinic, due to difficulty producing sputum on demand or for enhanced surveillance outside of routine clinics. This is increasingly important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic where many CF patients are unable to come into clinic due to shielding. However, these samples may experience fluctuations in temperature and hence altering the microbiology of a sample before processing. Here we report the impact of posting on the detection of common CF pathogens, and hence reliability of the culture reports. Method(s): Ninety-two sputum samples were collected from 72 adults with CF. Samples were weighed, mixed and split. One part was sent immediately to the microbiology lab and another was posted back to the lab through the post. Postal samples were returned and processed after a mean of 5 days. Aliquots at each stage were stored at -80oC for subsequent PCR-based analysis. In this study, we compared clinical microbiology reporting for the paired-sputum samples. Result(s): Overall prevalence for all organisms present in >10% of samples is shown in the Table. Sensitivity of the different sample types to each species is given as percent positive samples compared to all positive samples. Postal samples detected all Burkholderia cepacia complex, 92% of P. aeruginosa (versus 93% for the clinic sample) and 74% of Aspergillus spp. (versus 78% for the clinic sample). All other organisms were detected in postal samples at the same or higher rate as clinic samples. Conclusion(s): Despite being in the post for a median of 5 days, there was little difference in the culture-based microbiology results. Posting sputum samples therefore does not appear to reduce the identification of key CF microorganisms, which remain viable for several days after collection. PCR-based analyses of these same samples is ongoing.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load dynamics in the nasopharynx of infected children. It is important to understand the temporal trend of the paediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load to estimate the transmission potential of children in schools and communities. We determined differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral load dynamics between nasopharyngeal samples of infected asymptomatic and symptomatic children. Serial cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx of a cohort of infected children were collected for analysis. Among 17 infected children, 10 (58.8%) were symptomatic. Symptomatic children, when compared to asymptomatic children, had higher viral loads (mean cycle threshold on day 7 of illness 28.6 versus 36.7, p = 0.02). Peak SARSCoV-2 viral loads occured around day 2 of illness in infected children. Although we were unable to directly demonstrate infectivity, the detection of significant amounts of virus in the upper airway of asymptomatic children suggest that they have the potential to shed and transmit the SARS-CoV-2. Our study highlights the importance of contact tracing and screening for SARS-CoV-2 in children with epidemiological risk factors regardless of their symptom status, in order to improve containment of the virus in the community, including educational settings.Copyright © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

0	Evaluation of the usability of various rapid antibody tests in the diagnostic application for COVID-19. Background: The usability of laboratory tests related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critically important for the world undergoing the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic usability of rapid tests for the detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 through comparison of their results with the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and with the results of a quantitative test for antibody detection. Method(s): Serum samples were collected from 18 patients undergoing RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Twelve patients were RT-PCR positive while six were negative. A quantitative test based on chemiluminescent immunoassay and three rapid tests based on immunochromatography were performed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Result(s): All the antibody tests exhibited poor sensitivity at the timing of initial RT-PCR diagnosis. IgG responses occurring prior to or simultaneously with IgM responses were observed through not only the quantitative test but also the three rapid tests. Based on concordance with the quantitative test results, the large variance among the three rapid tests was revealed. Conclusion(s): All antibody tests were unsatisfactory to replace RT-PCR for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. Rapid antibody tests as well as a quantitative antibody test were useful in the assessment of immune responses in COVID-19. The obvious variance among the three rapid tests suggested limited accuracy and difficult standardization. Diagnostic usability of rapid antibody tests for COVID-19 should be investigated rigorously.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false

0	"Various Evidence-Based Hypothetical and Experimental Treatment Approaches and Their Effectiveness against COVID-19 Worldwide: A Comprehensive Literature Review. Several drugs are presently undergoing clinical studies to investigate their efficacy and safety in the handling of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite of the fact, certain encouraging results have been obtained thus far, however, these treatments have resulted in controversy as these are not based on data generated from direct conventional clinical trials. As the legal requirement for approval of drug is ""substantial"" evidence of effectiveness demonstrated through controlled clinical trials and requires a large portion of time. A number of clinical trials are currently in progress to evaluate possible therapies, but the worldwide reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak has been mostly restricted to monitoring/ suppression. In the meantime, scientists are struggling to discover antivirals specific to the virus either by screening/ testing available broad-spectrum antiviral drugs or redevelopment of newer particular drugs based on individual coronavirus (CoV) genome. Upto date, the hypothetical and experimental treatment approaches against COVID-19 that are tested or being testing are the use of antimalarial and antibiotics, antivirals, anti-parasitic, immunomodulators, anticoagulant treatment, antihypertensive, chinese traditional medicines and others (high temperature and high humidity) as well as vaccines development. This review summarized all the literature-based treatment approaches in various ways that are implementing for the management or treatment of COVID-19."	false
0	Risk Factors Associated with In-Hospital Mortality in a US National Sample of Patients with COVID-19. Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 8.1 million US residents and killed more than 221000. There is a dearth of research on epidemiology and clinical outcomes in US patients with COVID-19. Objective(s): To characterize patients with COVID-19 treated in US hospitals and to examine risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study was conducted using Premier Healthcare Database, a large geographically diverse all-payer hospital administrative database including 592 acute care hospitals in the United States. Inpatient and hospital-based outpatient visits with a principal or secondary discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code, U07.1) between April 1 and May 31, 2020, were included. Exposures: Characteristics of patients were reported by inpatient/outpatient and survival status. Risk factors associated with death examined included patient characteristics, acute complications, comorbidities, and medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, total hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, acute complications, and treatment patterns. Result(s): Overall, 64781 patients with COVID-19 (29479 [45.5%] outpatients; 35302 [54.5%] inpatients) were analyzed. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 46 (33-59) years for outpatients and 65 (52-77) years for inpatients; 31968 (49.3%) were men, 25841 (39.9%) were White US residents, and 14340 (22.1%) were Black US residents. In-hospital mortality was 20.3% among inpatients (7164 patients). A total of 5625 inpatients (15.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 6849 (19.4%) were admitted to the ICU. Median (IQR) inpatient LOS was 6 (3-10) days. Median (IQR) ICU LOS was 5 (2-10) days. Common acute complications among inpatients included acute respiratory failure (19706 [55.8%]), acute kidney failure (11971 [33.9%]), and sepsis (11910 [33.7%]). Older age was the risk factor most strongly associated with death (eg, age >=80 years vs 18-34 years: odds ratio [OR], 16.20; 95% CI, 11.58-22.67; P <.001). Receipt of statins (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56-0.65; P <.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46-0.60; P <.001), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79; P <.001) was associated with decreased odds of death. Compared with patients with no hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, patients with both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine had increased odds of death (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection in US acute care hospitals, COVID-19 was associated with high ICU admission and in-hospital mortality rates. Use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers were associated with decreased odds of death. Understanding the potential benefits of unproven treatments will require future randomized trials..Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	Evaluation of COVID-19 Intuitively Appealing Vaccine Protocols and R0 Increase Fears, Strategic Lessons. Background: Late phase COVID-19 strategic decisions are being made for vaccine protocols such as selective vs. fast. Quantitative trade studies have not appeared. A new faster spreading strain has developed. Quantitative analysis of how it will affect vaccination schedules and final unlock protocol are needed. Lessons learned papers so far deal with prevention of spreading and practice of care issues, leaving major strategy questions about vaccination approach and final unlock open. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We use an SIR-based model tuned for COVID-19 and accounting for seasonality, immunity decline, and vaccination. We add the capability to handle a changing fundamental replication rate (R0) and declining ratio of total to known cases (determined by data fitting). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: For the present R0 and vaccination schedule a full internal U.S. unlock in April or May 2021 is supportable, however infections reintroduced would propagate in the fall if immunity wears off in 240 days. If the increased R0 becomes established then the infection is never completely extinguished and recurs. If immunity lasts 240 days, re-vaccination is not needed until 2022 even with increased R0 making doses available for use in other countries. Likely 77,000 lives were lost by not meeting the initially planned vaccination targets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions: The usefulness of trade studies in saving lives is established. Intuitively appealing strategies are not necessarily optimal. Lack of inexpensive random sample testing hampers ability to do trade studies. Phase 3 vaccine trial protocols for epidemics with heavy loss of life should be revisited.	false
0	Mass hysteria and incidence rate control in the organized groups (RUDN University approach). The article presents the results of the comprehensive study of methods for countering mass panic and explosive morbidity in the organized community (on the example of a number of activities implemented at the RUDN University during the 'first wave' of the covid-19 pandemic). The authors used elements of theoretical and empirical, sociological and experimental methods of research. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the new coronavirus in March 2020, the world will never be the same - most aspects of social interaction have changed, and the RUDN University could not stay away from global and all-Russian trends. In the article, the concept of dealing with stress and mass panic is considered not at the individual level, but at the level of the full-size medical institution with a multinational and multicultural community of 9000 people, completely isolated from the society. The authors managed to develop a model of doctor's behavior, which proved to be effective when working with the younger generation (aged 18 to 35), including foreign students; provided an opportunity to control (to a certain limit) the mood of the masses on the entrusted territory, to ensure adherence to treatment and emotional support at all its stages. Due to the patient's feeling of control over his condition, understanding of what is happening and, as a result, the development of critical perception of all information, the negative impact of the mass panic reaction was significantly reduced. Therefore, the authors achieved a disciplined organized community that followed all quarantine and isolation instructions, which significantly smoothed the peak of the incidence curve.	false
0	Modelling the Effect of Self-Immunity and the Impacts of Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Individuals on COVID-19 Outbreak. COVID-19 is one of the most highly infectious diseases ever emerged and caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has already led the entire world to health and economic crisis. It has invaded the whole universe all most every way. The present study demonstrates with a nine mutually exclusive compartmental model on transmission dynamics of this pandemic disease (COVID-19), with special focus on the transmissibility of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection from susceptible individuals. Herein, the compartmental model has been investigated with mathematical analysis and computer simulations in order to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. Initially, mathematical analysis of the model has been carried out in broadly by illustrating some well-known methods including exactness, equilibrium and stability analysis in terms of basic reproduction number. We investigate the sensitivity of the model with respect to the variation of the parameters' values. Furthermore, computer simulations are performed to illustrate the results. Our analysis reveals that the death rate from coronavirus disease increases as the infection rate increases, whereas infection rate extensively decreases with the increase of quarantined individuals. The quarantined individuals also lead to increase the concentration of recovered individuals. However, the infection rate of COVID-19 increases more surprisingly as the rate of asymptomatic individuals increases than that of the symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the infection rate decreases significantly due to increase of self-immunity rate.	false
0	Inactivated rabies virus vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prevents disease in a Syrian hamster model. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials.	false
0	Transfusion reactions associated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy for SARSCoV-2 across the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Background/Case Studies: To date, convalescent plasma for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has shown effectiveness in severely ill patients in reducing mortality. While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to convalescent plasma is unknown. Here, we retrospectively examine 427 inpatient convalescent plasma transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions. Study Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 COVID-19 patients within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS), through eIND and EAP approval pathways by the FDA. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed determine the significance of these parameters and univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess which independent variables were correlated with a transfusion reaction. Results/Findings: Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusion events were identified (12.9% incidence), thirteen of which were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile non-hemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), allergic (1.8%), and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12-13, or a cancer diagnosis. A decreased risk was identified for patients in the age group of 80-89 years. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the use of convalescent plasma as a safe therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, cancer diagnosis, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.	false
0	Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, deaths, and fatality rate - Making a case for standardized reporting to improve communication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the world, testing each nation's ability to understand the state of the pandemic in their country and control it. As we looked into the epidemiological data to uncover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discovered that critical metadata is missing which is meant to give context to epidemiological parameters. In this perspective, we identify key metadata for the COVID-19 fatality rate after a thorough analysis of mathematical models, serology-informed studies and determinants of causes of death for the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we find reasons to establish a set of standard-based guidelines to record and report the data from epidemiological studies. Additionally, we discuss why standardizing nomenclature is be a necessary component of these guidelines to improve communication and reproducibility. The goal of establishing these guidelines is to facilitate the interpretation of COVID-19 epidemiological findings and data by the general public, health officials, policymakers and fellow researchers. Our suggestions may not address all aspects of this issue; rather, they are meant to be the foundation for which experts can establish and encourage future guidelines throughout the appropriate communities.

0	Synthetic protein conjugate vaccines provide protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mice. The global incidence of tuberculosis remains unacceptably high, with new preventative strategies needed to reduce the burden of disease. We describe here a method for the generation of synthetic self-adjuvanted protein vaccines and demonstrate application in vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Two vaccine constructs were designed, consisting of full-length ESAT6 protein fused to the TLR2-targeting adjuvants Pam2Cys-SK4 or Pam3Cys-SK4 These were produced by chemical synthesis using a peptide ligation strategy. The synthetic self-adjuvanting vaccines generated powerful local CD4+ T cell responses against ESAT6 and provided significant protection in the lungs from virulent M. tuberculosis aerosol challenge when administered to the pulmonary mucosa of mice. The flexible synthetic platform we describe, which allows incorporation of adjuvants to multiantigenic vaccines, represents a general approach that can be applied to rapidly assess vaccination strategies in preclinical models for a range of diseases, including against novel pandemic pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Are college campuses superspreaders? A data-driven modeling study. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

0	Dissecting strategies to tune the therapeutic potential of SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coupled with a lack of therapeutics, has paralyzed the globe. Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2021, Atyeo et al.	false
0	K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Additionally, we demonstrate that a mild disease course can be simulated by low dose infection with 102 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, resulting in minimal clinical manifestation and near uniform survival. Taken together, these data support future application of this model to studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.	false
0	Clinical Utility of a Nomogram for Predicting 30-Days Poor Outcome in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: Multicenter External Validation and Decision Curve Analysis. Aim: Early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who are likely to develop worse outcomes is of great importance, which may help select patients at risk of rapid deterioration who should require high-level monitoring and more aggressive treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 30-days poor outcome of patients with COVID-19. Method(s): The prediction model was developed in a primary cohort consisting of 233 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and data were collected from January 3 to March 20, 2020. We identified and integrated significant prognostic factors for 30-days poor outcome to construct a nomogram. The model was subjected to internal validation and to external validation with two separate cohorts of 110 and 118 cases, respectively. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its predictive accuracy, discriminative ability, and clinical usefulness. Result(s): In the primary cohort, the mean age of patients was 55.4 years and 129 (55.4%) were male. Prognostic factors contained in the clinical nomogram were age, lactic dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, serum creatinine, serum sodium, fasting blood glucose, and D-dimer. The model was externally validated in two cohorts achieving an AUC of 0.946 and 0.878, sensitivity of 100 and 79%, and specificity of 76.5 and 83.8%, respectively. Although adding CT score to the clinical nomogram (clinical-CT nomogram) did not yield better predictive performance, decision curve analysis showed that the clinical-CT nomogram provided better clinical utility than the clinical nomogram. Conclusion(s): We established and validated a nomogram that can provide an individual prediction of 30-days poor outcome for COVID-19 patients. This practical prognostic model may help clinicians in decision making and reduce mortality.© Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Chen, You, Chen, Li, Chen, Chen, Chen, Dong, Zeng and Zhang.	false

Kenya had notified a total of 34,057 cases, reported 574 deaths by end of August 2020. The Country's positivity rate had also come down from 13 to 4 percent between June and August 2020. Despite the gains in controlling the first COVID-19 wave from the non-pharmaceutical interventions, most countries would not sustain the economy with prolonged lockdown and restriction of movements. In Kenya, for instance, it resulted in easing some measures on 27th September 2020 in an attempt to reverse the economic strain. By end of October, the effects of these measures were already reversing with a positivity rate of 14 and bed occupancy of 140 percent. The goal of this study was to model the progression of COVID-19 cases in Kenya post reversed curve of the first wave of infections. <h4>Result: </h4> s An SEIR compartmental model was developed to predict the daily cases of COVID-19 post the reversed curve. The model had 8 compartments containing sub-populatoions of: Susceptible, Exposed, Symptomatic Infectious, Asymptomatic Infectious,Hospitalized,Intesive Care Unit, Deaths and Recovered. The model equations were then solved to obtain the number of cases that would be infected on a daily basis beginning March 14th to January 2021. The model results demonstrated that with the abscence of herd immunity in the general human population, relaxation of the mitigation measures will eventually result to resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The wave of infections length of stay will be 4 months upto January 2021 and will be on the rise to the peak for an estimated 45 days. The cumulative number of cases trend depicts the same pattern as that of the daily cases. It is predicted that the trend will be on the rise till January 2021. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Increased vigilance on post reversed COVID-19 curve is indispensable. Continued interventions such as mass and targetted testing, contact tracing and social distancing measures are imperative to ensure that new infections are isolated real time. This will inform new and appropriate interventions amidst the ongoing pandemic"	false
0	ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaque and ferret challenge models. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently required. Here we report detailed immune profiling after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) and subsequent challenge in two animal models of SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease. We demonstrate in rhesus macaques the lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia is reduced by prior vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 which induced neutralising antibody responses after a single intramuscular administration. In a second animal model, ferrets, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduced both virus shedding and lung pathology. Antibody titers were boosted by a second dose. Data from these challenge models and the detailed immune profiling, support the continued clinical evaluation of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.	false
0	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: The importance of prompt detection of cardiovascular involvement. Increased morbidity and mortality are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) when there is cardiovascular (CV) involvement. Due to the absence of prospective, well-designed, controlled studies, the exact mechanism responsible for cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. However, possible mechanisms described in observational studies can be considered. Non-ischemic events and ischemic myocardial involvement are the two main pathophysiological mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Non-ischemic myocardial injury is probably predominant and is secondary to multiple pathological mechanisms. Cardiac involvement is relatively common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a greater risk of in-hospital mortality and ventricular arrhythmias. There was also a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. It is important to promptly detect CV involvement to avoid increased mortality in these patients. These findings highlight the importance of clinical surveillance and laboratory testing of serum troponin levels to ensure appropriate early identification and proceed with appropriate treatment. This should apply to patients with/without prior CV involvement. There are several possible mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage and the exact mechanisms involved need to be explored in well-designed studies.Copyright © 2020 Centurion et al.	false
0	Intravenous Immunoglobulin May Reverse Multisystem Inflammation in COVID-19 Pneumonitis and Guillain-Barre. Introduction: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented crisis for public health, although several potential therapies have been provisionally applied but a unified consensus is yet to be achieved. Case description: A 75-year-old man, COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive on admission, presented with acute onset progressively ascending weakness of all four limbs. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study suggested acute demyelinating and axonal type of motor polyradiculo neuropathy. Hence, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) related to COVID-19 infection was considered. His respiratory status worsened to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on the second week of illness. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) dosed over 5 days. His ventilator support started to improve after the 10th day of admission. His inflammatory markers started to improve, ventilator supports were weaned down and he was extubated on the 17th day of illness. Intravenous immunoglobulin is rich in viral immunoglobulin G (IgG), competitively binds Fcy receptor, preventing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from attaching to the angiotensin-conver ting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor, inhibiting viral entry into the cell. Clinical significance: Intravenous immunoglobulin can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors and decrease inflammatory injury, multisystem inflammation (MSI) in SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: While the use of hyperimmune globulin requires a tedious job of collection from convalescent patients with verified and adequate titers, the use of IVIg could be an easier option to modulate the immune storm and faster recovery in SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Impact in Latin America. Background : Latin America has now become the epicenter of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, a profound burden of SARS-COV-2 infection has been reported in Latin America. In the present study, we aim to determine the profiles that are associated with this disease in Latin America. We analyzed symptoms, morbidities and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations by country. Methods: We analyzed data from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients evaluated at healthcare centers and hospitals of 8 Latin American countries including Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia between March 1 and July 30, 2020. These countries consist of a total population that exceeds 519 million. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities and lethality were performed. Results: A total of 728,282 patients tested positive for COVID-19 across all the 8 Latin American countries. Of these, 52.6% were female. The average age was 48.4 years. Peru had the oldest cohort with 56.8 years old and highest rate of females (56.8%) while Chile had the youngest cohort (39 years old). Venezuela had the highest male prevalence (56.7%). Most common symptoms were cough with 60.1% (Bolivia had the highest rate 78%), fatigue/tiredness with 52.0%, sore throat with 50.3%, and fever with 44.2%. Bolivia had fever as the top symptom (83.3%). GI symptoms including diarrhea (highest in Mexico with 22.9%), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were not associated with higher mortality. Hypertension was among the top (12.1%) comorbidities followed by diabetes with 8.3% and obesity 4.5%. In multivariable analyses, the leading and significant comorbidities were hypertension (r=0.83, p=0.02), diabetes (r=0.91, p=0.01), and obesity (r=0.86, p=0.03). Asthma (r=0.37, p=0.54) and increasing age (0.13 p=0.81) were not independently associated with higher mortality. Lethality was highest in Mexico (16.6%) and lowest in Venezuela (0.9%) among the analyzed cohorts. Conclusion:  Nearly, 10.5%-53% of patients with COVID-19 have GI manifestations. Differential clinical symptoms were associated with COVID-19 in Latin America countries. Metabolic syndrome components were the main comorbidities associated with poor outcome. Country-specific management and prevention plans are needed. Country-specific management and prevention plans can be established from this meta-analysis.	false

The objectives were to (1) assess the prevalence of hand-washing practices across 80 countries and (2) assess frequency of hand-washing practice by economic status (country income and severe food insecurity), in a global representative sample of adolescents. Cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey 2003-2017 were analyzed. Data on age, sex, hand-washing practices in the past 30 days, and severe food insecurity (i.e., proxy of socioeconomic status) were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis with random effects based on country-wise estimates were conducted to assess associations. Adolescents (n = 209,584) aged 12-15 years [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 50.9% boys] were included in the analysis. Overall, the prevalence of hand-washing practices were as follows: never/rarely washing hands before eating (6.4%), after using toilet (5.6%), or with soap (8.8%). The prevalence of never/rarely washing hands after using the toilet (10.8%) or with soap (14.3%) was particularly high in low-income countries. Severe food insecurity was associated with 1.34 (95%CI = 1.25-1.43), 1.61 (95%CI = 1.50-1.73), and 1.44 (95%CI = 1.35-1.53) times higher odds for never/rarely washing hands before eating, after using the toilet, and with soap, respectively. A high prevalence of inadequate hand washing practices was reported, particularly in low-income countries and those with severe food insecurity. In light of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid expansion being observed in low-and middle-income locations, interventions that disseminate good hand-washing practices are urgently required. Such interventions may also have cross-over benefits in relation to other poor sanitation-related diseases.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and mortality: an expanded re-analysis of a recent publication. BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations., METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations., RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94)., CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.	false
0	"Anti-phospholipids antibodies and immune complexes in COVID-19 patients: a putative role in disease course for anti-annexin-V antibodies. INTRODUCTION: Besides distinctive respiratory and digestive hallmarks, COVID-19 has been recently associated with a high prevalence of pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable states known as ""COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy"" (CAC), corresponding to a worsening in patients' conditions, whose causes are still to be elucidated. A link between anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and viral infections has long been suggested. APLs are assessed for anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) diagnosis, characterized by thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and coagulopathy. Furthermore, circulating immune complexes (CICs), arisen upon inflammatory responses and related immune dysregulation, can lead to endothelial cell damage and thrombotic complications., METHOD: We performed an extended panel including IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin, IgG/IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein-1, coupled with IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin, IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time), and a negative control group. IgG CIC analysis followed to evaluate inflammatory status, through a possible complement system activation., RESULTS: Our results showed low positive case percentage in IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin and IgG/IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein-1 assays (4.54%, 6.25%, and 4.55%; in early infection group, late infection group, and control group, respectively); few positive cases in IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V immunoassays; and no IgG CIC positivity in any patient., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data show a low aPL prevalence, likely excluding an involvement in the pathogenesis of CAC. Interestingly, IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and anti-annexin-V positive cases, detected in late infection group, suggest that aPLs could temporarily increase or could trigger a ""COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome"" in predisposed patients. Key Points * To our knowledge, anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies, anti-annexin-V antibodies and CICs in COVID-19 patients have not been reported in the scientific literature. * Lack of uniformity and the low percentage of aCL/abeta2GP1 positivity preclude a putative role in CAC pathogenesis. * IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V data show that distribution of positive case number increases in late infection patients, significantly in anti-annexin-V results, suggesting a possible role for these anti-phospholipid antibodies in disease course. * aPLs can arise transiently in some patients with critical illness and SARS-CoV-2 infection (disappearing in a few weeks), as well as in other genetically predisposed patients; they could trigger a ""COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome""."	false
0	Pregnancy course, obstetric and therapeutic tactics for novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in pregnant women. The novel coronavirus infection (NCI) (COVID-19) pandemic has posed real social, political and health challenges to the entire world. Many aspects of the management and course of this infection are controversial. The physiological characteristics of a pregnant woman's body place her, on the one hand, at risk for a more severe course of NCI, which has been confirmed in some studies. However, other authors point out that COVID-19 in pregnant women occurs in the same fashion or even more easily than in the general population. There are limited data on the prevalence of NCI among pregnant women in the Russian Federation. There are reports of both maternal and neonatal NCI-related deaths worldwide. There is a limited range of drugs used to treat NCI in pregnant women. Etiotropic therapy with a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir can be performed. Some publications have shown the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe NCI. A prevailing number of recommendations indicate that vaginal delivery is preferable for pregnant women with NCI; however, most of them deliver an infant via cesarean section. Spousal presence during childbirth and the possibility of breastfeeding remain controversial: from ban (before having a negative COVID-19 test) to measures to support the women. There are no convincing data on the possibility of COVID-19 vertical transmission, but this issue and the rehabilitation of pregnant women who have experienced NCI (COVID-19) require further investigations. Conclusion. Pregnancy and childbirth do not worsen the course of NCI (COVID-19). However, there are risks for some pregnancy complications, as well as neonatal ones, during both pregnancy and the long periods after the experienced NCI (COVID-19), especially its severe types. There are no convincing data on the possibility of COVID-19 vertical transmission, but this issue and the rehabilitation of pregnant women who have experienced NCI (COVID-19) require further investigations.Copyright © A group of authors, 2020.	false
0	"Steps towards implementing evidence-based screening in family medicine in Ukraine: SWOT-analysis of an approach of multidimensional empowerment. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists. EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom)., METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine., RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform ""Screening adviser"" to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement. The presented SWOT-analysis of this ongoing implementation process allows to plan and optimize future steps towards a state based and supports EBS program in Ukraine."	false
0	Depression, risk factors, and coping strategies in the context of social dislocations resulting from the second wave of COVID-19 in Japan. BACKGROUND: Social dislocations resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been prolonged, which has led to general population social suppression. The present study aimed to reveal risk factors associated with mental health problems and suggest concrete coping strategies in the context of COVID-19., METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in July when Japan was experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. Demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), state anger, anger control, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analysis on PHQ-9 scores by set variables was conducted., RESULTS: The participants were 2708 individuals, and 18.35% of them were depressed. Logistic regression analysis showed that in the order of odds ratios (ORs), underlying disease (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-2.92), not working (OR = 1.85, CI = 1.22-2.80), negative economic impact (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.01-1.77), state anger (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.14-1.21), anger control (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.04-1.13), age (OR = 0.97, CI = 0.96-0.98), high income (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.25-0.80), and being married (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.38-0.74) were predictors of depressive symptoms. Regarding coping strategies, planning (OR = 0.84, CI = 0.74-0.94), use of instrumental support (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.76-0.95), denial (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.77-0.99), behavioural disengagement (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.13-1.44), and self-blame (OR = 1.47, CI = 1.31-1.65) were associated with probable depression., CONCLUSIONS: During prolonged psychological distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japan was two to nine times as high as before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though Japan was not a lockdown country. Although some coping strategies were useful for maintaining mental health, such as developing ways, alone or with others, to address or avoid social dislocations, the influence of demographics was more powerful than these coping strategies, and medical treatments are needed for high-risk individuals.	false
0	Assessment of Depression Severity During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Among the Palestinian Population: A Growing Concern and an Immediate Consideration. Background: Aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures were implemented as protective public health actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Assessing the psychological effects associated with these measures is an important attempt to inform local policymakers in an early stage. Yet little is known about these effects, specifically depression, among the Palestinians. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression among the Palestinian community during this pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional web-based survey throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram) was carried out using an anonymous online questionnaire. The validated and standardized depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) was used to measure depression severity. A snowball technique recruiting the general public living in Palestine was conducted. Data were collected between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to the middle interval of strict massive lockdown in Palestine on 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multinomial logistic regression model was developed to predict depression severity. Result(s): About 2,819 respondents filled out the questionnaire. Depression prevalence was (57.5%; n = 1,621). Out of them, 66% had mild/moderate severity, and 34% had severe/extremely severe degree. Depression severity was negatively associated with age {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.98 (0.97-0.99)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.94-0.97)]} degrees compared with normal degree. Males were significantly less likely to have higher depression than females {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.57-0.85)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.40-0.86)]} degree. However, those who reported having inadequate food supply and lesser monthly incomes were more likely to have a higher degree of depression as compared with normal degree. Single persons were significantly more likely to have mild/moderate depression than those in a relationship [OR (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.05-1.64)]. Conclusion(s): High depression prevalence (57.5%) among the Palestinian community during the COVID-19 pandemic is a growing public health concern. It is essential to provide psychological counseling and treatment during and after the pandemic for the targeted people at high risk (young age/female gender) who were affected psychologically. Strategic long-term policy to address pandemic ramifications, including depression, by implementing comprehensive interventions taking into account socioeconomic disparities, vulnerability, and inequities, is crucial to emerge from this crisis in Palestine.© Copyright © 2020 Al Zabadi, Alhroub, Yaseen and Haj-Yahya.	false
0	Suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in Greece: Prevalence in the community, risk and protective factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the community as well as the risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation during restriction measures in Greece, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Alpha web-based anonymous survey was conducted during the first lockdown period. Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISK-2), and a self-report questionnaire for COVID-19 pandemic-related data. From a total of 5,116 adults included in the study, 5.20% reported suicidal thoughts, 14.17% were potential clinical cases of anxiety, and 26.51% of depression. Participants presented significantly higher suicidal ideation rates during the last two weeks of the lockdown compared to its previous two weeks. Unmarried or divorced marital status, mental health history, poor perceived quality of physical health, impaired family functioning, anxiety and depression symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation, whereas higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being were associated with lower suicidal ideation odds. According to the findings, suicidal ideation prevalence might be considered elevated and its increase during the lockdown period alarming. The risk and protective factors identified in the study offer valuable information for the development of preventive strategies against suicidal ideation, especially in times of crisis.

0	The Psychological Burden of COVID-19 Stigma: Evaluation of the Mental Health of Isolated Mild Condition COVID-19 Patients. BACKGROUND: The objective of this article is to assess the mental health issues of the mild condition coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to a community treatment center (CTC) in Korea., METHODS: A total of 107 patients admitted to a CTC were included as the study population, and their mental health problems including depression (patient health questionnaire-9), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder scale-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist-5) and somatic symptoms (by patient health questionnaire-15) were evaluated every week during their stay. The stigma related to COVID-19 infection was evaluated with an adjusted version of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) stigma scale., RESULTS: During the first week of isolation, the prevalence of more-than-moderate depression was 24.3%, more-than-moderate anxiety was 14.9%, more-than-moderate somatic symptoms was 36.5% and possible PTSD was 5.6% of total population. For depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors. For PTSD, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection as well as total duration of isolation were found to be significant risk factors. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and possible PTSD remained similar across the four weeks of observations, though the prevalence of severe depression, increased after four weeks of stay. Somatic symptoms seemed to decrease during their stay., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that social mitigation of COVID-19 related stigma, as well as care of patients with pre-existing mental health problems are important mental health measures during this crisis period. It is also important that clinical guidelines and public health policies be well balanced over the protection of the public and those quarantined to minimize the negative psychosocial consequences from isolation of the patients.

0	An online observational study assessing clinical characteristics and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: a perspective study from Bangladesh. Purpose: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has cost numerous lives and induced tremendous mental stress among people. The purpose of this research was to determine anxiety and depression levels, clinical features, and the connections between demographic variables and depression prevalence as well as anxiety prevalence among reported COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh., Methods: For the purpose of data collection, an online cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 26 to June 27, 2020, utilizing a Google adapted preformed questionnaire. The form was shared with a short overview and justification through Facebook, Twitter, Facebook messenger, Viber, and What's App. The Google form contains five parts: a brief introduction, an approval statement, demographics, clinical and radiological data, and mental health assessment by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Formal ethical clearance was taken from the Institute of Biological Science (IBSc), Bangladesh. Informed consent was ensured before participation., Results: One hundred and fifty-three (153) patients with COVID-19 who had an average age of 39.43 +/- 17.59 years with male predominance (72%) were included. A total of 32.7% were doing health-care related jobs, and 17.7% lost their jobs due to COVID-19. Patients had a median income of 30,000 Bangladesh taka (BDT). Of all, 12.4% of the participants showed asymptomatic features, whereas 87.6% of patients were symptomatic and presented with fever (79%), cough (58.8%), myalgia (24.2%), breathlessness (23.5%), sore throat (21.6%), fatigue (19.6%), headache (13.7%), nausea and/or vomiting (11.8%), runny nose (9.8%), chest pain (9.2%), diarrhea (8.5%), stuffy nose (3.2%), ARDS (2.6%), oral ulcer (2.6%), and conjunctivitis (1.9%). Overall, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 63.5% and 56.6%, respectively. Among the participants, 13.2% had only anxiety, 6.3% had only depression, and 50.3% had both., Conclusion: In most cases, middle age, male, and healthy workers were patients. Fever and cough were the standard presentations. Approximately two-thirds or 66.67% of patients had anxiety and depression, one or both.

0	Patients' Responses to the Sudden Interruption of Chemotherapy During the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus: A Cross-Sectional Study. Purpose: This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the responses of cancer patients' indifferent chemotherapy cycles to the unstructured treatment interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic in China., Patients and Methods: Data from 156 adult patients with common solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy or ready to begin chemotherapy after surgery before the COVID-19 outbreak were analyzed in the study. Patients' responses to the chemotherapy interruption and their anxiety were assessed., Results: Overall, 141 (90%) patients completed the study, and 115 (81.6%) accepted a switch from their previous intravenous chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. Of these, 29 (65.9%) patients with lung cancer, 25 (86.2%) with gastric cancer, 33 (89.2%) with colorectal cancer and 28 (90.3%) with breast cancer switched from intravenous to oral treatment, heeding their doctor's advice. Of the participants, 85 (60.3%) patients reported that they had taken at least one kind of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) scores increased in patients with advanced refractory cancer compared with the scores of adjuvant chemotherapy patients (P < 0.05). The prevalence of anxiety was high in cancer patients aged 60 years or older. Furthermore, anxiety was associated with advanced incurable cancer (P < 0.05), and this finding remained after adjusting for chronic pain. In addition, there were significantly increased scores of anxiety in patients with lung cancer (P <0 0.05)., Conclusion: Our study shows that most cancer patients remained relatively stable and had switched from intravenous to oral treatment at home. Among them, an increasing number of patients began to seek CAM as a complementary therapeutic approach. Patients with advanced refractory cancer were more likely to experience anxiety, and lung cancer patients should receive special attention. Copyright © 2021 Zhang et al.	false
0	Anxiety level among students of different college and universities in India during lock down in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: COVID-19 incidence became a pandemic immediately after its origin and spread. Apart from death because of coronavirus infection, the pandemic brought unbearable psychological pressure to all. We assessed the psychological pressure on college and university students in India through cluster sampling., Methods: The students responded (n = 209) to an online questionnaire following the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) with some other basic information., Results: According to GAD-7 scoring, we found the respondent students had severe anxiety (1.44%), moderately severe anxiety (14.35%), moderate anxiety (36.36%) and mild anxiety (47.85%). Following HAM-A scoring, anxiety level among the students could be scaled as severe (0.96%), high (4.31%), moderate (13.40%) and mild anxiety (34.93%) level. Age of the students was a confounding factor (p = 0.049, HAM-A) of experiencing anxiety, students <20 years of age were more anxious. We found female students to be more anxious than the males following the HAM-A scoring tool. Academic delays (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.036) and impact on daily life (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.117) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms, while social support was marginally correlated (R2 = 0.726, p = 0.069) with the anxiety level., Conclusions: As the study found almost all the students are experiencing anxiety because of the current pandemic situation, continuous observation of psychological health for all is recommended as well as establishing psychological intervention during the preparedness phase.

0	Is Obesity Policy in England Fit for Purpose? Analysis of Government Strategies and Policies, 1992-2020. Policy Points This analysis finds that government obesity policies in England have largely been proposed in a way that does not readily lead to implementation; that governments rarely commission evaluations of previous government strategies or learn from policy failures; that governments have tended to adopt less interventionist policy approaches; and that policies largely make high demands on individual agency, meaning they rely on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences and are thus less likely to be effective or equitable. These findings may help explain why after 30 years of proposed government obesity policies, obesity prevalence and health inequities still have not been successfully reduced. If policymakers address the issues identified in this analysis, population obesity could be tackled more successfully, which has added urgency given the COVID-19 pandemic., CONTEXT: In England, the majority of adults, and more than a quarter of children aged 2 to 15 years live with obesity or excess weight. From 1992 to 2020, even though the government published 14 obesity strategies in England, the prevalence of obesity has not been reduced. We aimed to determine whether such government strategies and policies have been fit for purpose regarding their strategic focus, nature, basis in theory and evidence, and implementation viability., METHOD: We undertook a mixed-methods study, involving a document review and analysis of government strategies either wholly or partially dedicated to tackling obesity in England. We developed a theory-based analytical framework, using content analysis and applied thematic analysis (ATA) to code all policies. Our interpretation drew on quantitative findings and thematic analysis., FINDINGS: We identified and analyzed 14 government strategies published from 1992 to 2020 containing 689 wide-ranging policies. Policies were largely proposed in a way that would be unlikely to lead to implementation; the majority were not interventionist and made high demands on individual agency, meaning that they relied on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences, and are thus less likely to be effective or to reduce health inequalities., CONCLUSIONS: The government obesity strategies' failure to reduce the prevalence of obesity in England for almost 30 years may be due to weaknesses in the policies' design, leading to a lack of effectiveness, but they may also be due to failures of implementation and evaluation. These failures appear to have led to insufficient or no policy learning and governments proposing similar or identical policies repeatedly over many years. Governments should learn from their earlier policy failures. They should prioritize policies that make minimal demands on individuals and have the potential for population-wide reach so as to maximize their potential for equitable impacts. Policies should be proposed in ways that readily lead to implementation and evaluation. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Interrelations between COVID-19 and other disorders. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory tract virus that causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread across the globe to-date. The disease ranges from asymptomatic carriers to symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, lung infections, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death. As many as 50% of patients reported having at least one comorbidities with COVID-19 upon hospital admission. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most commonly reported. Comorbidities are contributing to acute disease prognosis and increased risk of severe symptoms. Around 70% of patients who require ICU care have been observed to have comorbidities. This review intends to understand how some of these comorbidities affect the disease's prognosis and how severe the outcome can be expected.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	G6PD deficiency and severity of COVID19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome: tip of the iceberg?. The severe pneumonia caused by the human coronavirus (hCoV)-SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted heavy casualties, especially among the elderly and those with co-morbid illnesses irrespective of their age. The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X-linked enzyme deficiency, associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated: six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex, co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters-LDH, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support ; 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in normal vs. G6PDd groups included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P = 0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P = 0.05), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P = 0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P = 0.03), and hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P = 0.015). Only one patient with G6PDd died; 16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PDd in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation. It is imperative that further studies are performed to understand the interplay between the viral and host factors in G6PDd that may lead to disparity in outcomes. KEY POINTS: * COVID19 studies show higher mortality in men, due to severe pneumonia and ARDS, indicating possible X-linked mediated differences * G6PD, the most common X-linked enzymopathy, highly prevalent in African Americans and Italians, maintains redox homeostasis. * Preclinical studies using G6PD deficient (G6PDd) cells infected with human coronavirus (hCoV), show impaired cellular responses, viral proliferation and worsening oxidative damage. * Retrospective chart review in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen shows differences between the two groups (Normal and G6PDd) in hematological indices; the G6PDdgroup demonstrated prolonged PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and longer days on mechanical ventilation indicating the severity of the pneumonia.	false
0	C-reactive protein and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: A systemic inflammatory response is observed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, are associated with severe disease in bacterial or viral infections. We aimed to explore associations between CRP concentration at initial hospital presentation and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19., METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive adults aged >=18 years with COVID-19 admitted to a large New York healthcare system between 1 March and 8 April 2020 were identified. Patients with measurement of CRP were included. Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), acute kidney injury (AKI), critical illness, and in-hospital mortality were determined for all patients. Among 2782 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 2601 (93.5%) had a CRP measurement [median 108 mg/L, interquartile range (IQR) 53-169]. CRP concentrations above the median value were associated with VTE [8.3% vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-3.36], AKI (43.0% vs. 28.4%; aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.76-2.52), critical illness (47.6% vs. 25.9%; aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.37-3.37), and mortality (32.2% vs. 17.8%; aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.11-3.18), compared with CRP below the median. A dose response was observed between CRP concentration and adverse outcomes. While the associations between CRP and adverse outcomes were consistent among patients with low and high D-dimer levels, patients with high D-dimer and high CRP have the greatest risk of adverse outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation, as measured by CRP, is strongly associated with VTE, AKI, critical illness, and mortality in COVID-19. CRP-based approaches to risk stratification and treatment should be tested. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2021.

After coronavirus spread beyond China, many predicted that the virus would wreak havoc on low-income countries, especially those with overcrowded slums. And yet, nine months after the outbreak, the COVID-19 death toll in several of the world&rsquo;s biggest slums is very low. This paper asks the question: Do Bangladeshi slum dwellers possess some form of immunity to the effects of COVID-19? To shed light on the problem, we undertook two rounds of a survey in three of Dhaka city's largest slums before and after a super spreader event, the Eid-al-Adha festival. The findings suggest very low or negligible COVID-19 fatality among slum households. We propose four explanations of the seeming immunity to coronavirus among Dhaka&rsquo;s slum dwellers.	false
0	Distinct lung-homing receptor expression and activation profiles on NK cell and T cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza. Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3 + , CXCR6 + , and/or CCR5 + NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections. <h4>Author summary</h4> The composition of in particular CXCR3 + and/or CXCR6 + NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease. Lung-homing receptor-expression is biased towards phenotypically activated NK cells and T cells, suggesting a functional role for these cells co-expressing in particular CXCR3 and/or CXCR6 upon homing towards the lung.	false
0	CAR-NK Cells Effectively Target the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2-infected Cells. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious presenting a significant public health issue. Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore would be more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently published CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.	false
0	Deaths From COVID-19 in Rural, Micropolitan, and Metropolitan Areas: A County-Level Comparison. PURPOSE: The United States has experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas. Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States. METHOD(S): This study used county-level data. The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics. The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC. Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19. The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020. FINDINGS: After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70.3% (P < .001) for rural counties and 53.4% (P < .001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period. CONCLUSION(S): Over time, rural geography and social isolation may not provide sustainable protection to rural residents from the pandemic. The slow progression provides rural areas additional time and opportunity to learn from the experiences in urban areas that were most affected. Rural areas need to be proactive and develop prevention strategies and response plans to manage and control the spread of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 National Rural Health Association.	false
0	Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Covid-19 in Women. Background: While women account for 40-50 % of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no specific data have been reported in this population. Purpose(s): Assess the burden of cardiovascular comorbidities on outcomes in women hospitalized for Covid-19. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective observational multicenter study from February 26 to April 20, 2020 in 24 French hospitals including all adults admitted for Covid-19. Primary composite outcome included transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. Result(s): Among 2878 patients hospitalized for Covid-19, 1212 (42.1 %) were women. Women were significantly older (68.3 +/- 18.0 vs. 65.4 +/- 16.0 years, P < 0.001) but had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. Among women, 276 (22.8 %) experienced the primary outcome, including 161 (13.3 %) transfer to ICU and 115 (9.5 %) deaths without transfer to ICU. The survival free from death or transfer to ICU was higher in women (HR 0.63, 95 %CI 0.53-0.73, P < 0.001), whereas the observed difference in in-hospital deaths did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.18). The proportion of women that experienced the primary outcome were 37.8 % in women with heart failure (n = 112), 30.9 % in women with coronary artery disease (n = 81), 29.1 % in women with diabetes (n = 254), 26.1 % in women with dyslipidemia (n = 315), and 26.0 % in women with hypertension (n = 632). Age (HR 1.05, 5 years increments, 95 %CI 1.01-1.10), body mass index (HR 1.06, 2 units increments, 95 %CI 1.02-1.10), chronic kidney disease (HR 1.57, 95 %CI 1.11-2.22), and heart failure (HR 1.52, 95 %CI 1.04-2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Women hospitalized for Covid-19 were older and had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. While female sex was associated with a lower risk of transfer to ICU or in-hospital death, Covid-19 remains associated with considerable morbi-mortality in women, especially in those with cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19: a marker of good prognosis?. INTRODUCTION: In May 2020, the World Health Organization recognized olfactory dysfunction as a COVID-19 symptom. The presence of hyposmia/anosmia may be a marker of good prognosis in COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: To associate the presence of olfaction disorder to the clinical condition severity in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: Individuals with the flu syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, diagnosed from March to June 2020, were recruited. They were divided into three groups: mild flu syndrome, severe flu syndrome (admitted to hospital wards) and critical illness (admitted to the ICU). Inpatients were interviewed by telephone contact after hospital discharge and their medical records were also evaluated regarding complementary test results. Outpatients answered an electronic questionnaire containing only clinical information., RESULTS: A total of 261 patients participated in the study: 23.75% with mild flu syndrome, 57.85% with severe flu syndrome and 18.40% with critical illness. A total of 66.28% patients with COVID-19 had olfaction disorders. In approximately 56.58% of the individuals the smell alterations lasted between 9 days and 2 months. There was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with olfactory dysfunction in the group with mild flu syndrome than in the severe flu syndrome group (mildxsevere - p<0.001; Odds Ratio=4.63; 95% CI [1.87-10.86]). This relationship was also maintained between patients with mild flu syndrome and critically-ill patients (mildxcritical - p< 0.001; Odds Ratio = 9.28; 95% CI [3.52-25.53])., CONCLUSION: Olfaction dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with mild flu syndrome in COVID-19. It may be a predictor of a good prognosis for this infection. New population-based studies must be carried out to corroborate these findings.

0	Impact of Training and Municipal Support on Primary Health Care-Based Measurement of Alcohol Consumption in Three Latin American Countries: 5-Month Outcome Results of the Quasi-experimental Randomized SCALA Trial. PURPOSE: We aimed to test the effects of providing municipal support and training to primary health care providers compared to both training alone and to care as usual on the proportion of adult patients having their alcohol consumption measured., METHODS: We undertook a quasi-experimental study reporting on a 5-month implementation period in 58 primary health care centres from municipal areas within Bogota (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru). Within the municipal areas, units were randomized to four arms: (1) care as usual (control); (2) training alone; (3) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a less intensive clinical and training package; and (4) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a more intense clinical and training package. The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of consulting adult patients out of the population registered within the centre whose alcohol consumption was measured (coverage)., RESULTS: The combination of municipal support and training did not result in higher coverage than training alone (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.8). Training alone resulted in higher coverage than no training (IRR = 9.8, 95% CI = 4.1 to 24.7). Coverage did not differ by intensity of the clinical and training package (coefficient = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.5)., CONCLUSIONS: Training of providers is key to increasing coverage of alcohol measurement amongst primary health care patients. Although municipal support provided no added value, it is too early to conclude this finding, since full implementation was shortened due to COVID-19 restrictions., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT03524599; Registered 15 May 2018; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03524599.	false
0	Facing the digital divide into a dementia clinic during COVID-19 pandemic: caregiver age matters. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically stressed the health care system and has provoked changes in population use of digital technologies. Digital divide is any uneven distribution in Information and Communications Technologies between people., AIMS: The purpose of this work was to describe the digital divide of a population of patients with dementia contacted by telemedicine during Italian lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic., METHOD: One hundred eight patients with cognitive impairment were contacted by video call to perform a telemedicine neurological evaluation. Information on patients and caregivers attending the televisit were recorded., RESULTS: Seventy-four patients connected with neurologist (successful televisit, 68.5%) and 34 patients were not able to perform televisit and were contacted by phone (failed televisit, 31.5%). No significant differences were observed among the two groups concerning age, gender, and education, but the prevalence of successful televisit was higher in the presence of younger caregivers: televisits performed in the presence of subjects of younger generation (sons and grandsons) had a successful rate higher (86% successful, 14% failed) than the group without younger generation caregiver (49% successful, 51% failed). This difference is mainly due to the ability of technological use among younger people., DISCUSSION: The most impacting factors on digital divide in our population are the social support networks and the experience with the technology: the presence of a digital native caregiver. The COVID-19 pandemic is unmasking an emerging form of technology-related social inequalities: political and community interventions are needed to support the most socially vulnerable population and prevent social health inequalities.	false
0	TSP-based PCR for rapid identification of L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: In the initial few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, two distinct strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified (L and S strain) based on a tightly linked SNP between two widely separated nucleotides at location 8782 (ORF1ab T8517C) and position 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, codon S84L)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available upto April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively., RESULTS: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence ~ 90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2., CONCLUSION: TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April, 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution.

0	Designing a next generation multi-epitope based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by WHO (World Health Organization) in March, 2020. Within 6 months, nearly 750,000 deaths are claimed by COVID-19 across the globe. This called for immediate social, scientific, technological, public and community interventions. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, global efforts are underway to develop preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, Spike (S) glycoprotein (a.k.a S Protein) is the most studied target known to trigger strong host immune response. A detailed analysis of S protein-based epitopes enabled us to design a novel B-cell-derived T-cell Multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine candidate. This involved a systematic and comprehensive computational protocol consisting of prediction of dual-purpose epitopes and designing an MEBP vaccine construct. This was followed by 3D structure validation, MEBP complex interaction studies, in silico cloning and vaccine dose-based immune response simulation to evaluate the immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct. The dual-purpose epitope prediction protocol was designed such that the same epitope elicits both humoral and cellular immune response unlike the earlier designs. Further, the epitopes predicted were screened against stringent criteria to ensure selection of a potent candidate with maximum antigen coverage and best immune response. The vaccine dose-based immune response simulation studies revealed a rapid antigen clearance through antibody generation and elevated levels of cell-mediated immunity during repeated exposure of the vaccine. The favourable results of the analysis strongly indicate that the vaccine construct is indeed a potent vaccine candidate and ready to proceed to the next steps of experimental validation and efficacy studies., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-020-02574-x.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Immunoassay for Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the Emergency Department. BACKGROUND: In the emergency department (ED) setting, rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 is likely associated with advantages to patients and healthcare workers, for example enabling early but rationale use of limited isolation resources. Most recently, several SARS-CoV-2 rapid point-of-care antigen tests (AGTEST) became available. There is a growing need for data regarding their clinical utility and performance in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the real life setting of 5 EDs., METHODS: We implemented AGTEST (here: Roche/SD Biosensor) in all four adult and the one pediatric EDs at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin in our diagnostic testing strategy. Test indication was limited to symptomatic suspected COVID-19 patients. Detailed written instructions on who to test were distributed and testing personnel were trained in proper specimen collection and handling. In each suspected COVID-19 patient, two sequential deep oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for viral tests. The first swab was collected for nucleic acid testing through SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (rt)-PCR diagnostic panel (PCRTEST) in the central laboratory. The second swab was collected to perform the AGTEST. Analysis of routine data was prospectively planned and data were retrieved from the medical records after the inclusion period in the adult or pediatric ED. Diagnostic performance was calculated using the PCRTEST as reference standard. False negative and false positive AGTEST results were analyzed individually and compared with viral concentrations derived from the calibrated PCRTEST., RESULTS: We included n = 483 patients including n= 202 from the pediatric ED. N = 10 patients had to be excluded due to missing data and finally n = 473 patients were analyzed. In the adult cohort, the sensitivity of the AGTEST was 75.3 (95%CI: 65.8/83.4)% and the specificity was 100 (95%CI: 98.4/100)% with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 32.8%; the positive predictive value was 100 (95%CI: 95.7/100)% and the negative predictive value 89.2 (95%CI: 84.5/93.9)%. In the pediatric cohort the sensitivity was 72.0 (95%CI: 53.3/86.7)%, the specificity was 99.4 (95%CI:97.3/99.9)% with a prevalence of 12.4%; the positive predictive value was 94.7 (95%CI: 78.3/99.7)% and the negative predictive value was 96.2 (95%CI:92.7/98.3)%.Thus, n = 22 adult and n = 7 pediatric patients showed false negative AGTEST results and only one false positive AGTEST occurred, in the pediatric cohort. Calculated viral concentrations from the rt-PCR lay between 3.16 and 9.51 log10 RNA copies/mL buffer. All false negative patients in the adult ED cohort, who had confirmed symptom onset at least seven days earlier had less than 5x 10^5 RNA copies/mL buffer., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of AGTEST among symptomatic patients in the emergency setting is useful for the early identification of COVID-19, but patients who test negative require confirmation by PCRTEST and must stay isolated until this result becomes available. Adult patients with a false negative AGTEST and symptom onset at least one week earlier have typically a low SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and likely pass the infectious period.	false
0	Public's understanding of swab test results for SARS-CoV-2: an online behavioural experiment during the April 2020 lockdown. OBJECTIVE: Although widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 is in place, little is known about how well the public understands these results. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the general public's grasp of the accuracy and significance of the results of the swab test., DESIGN: Web-based behavioural experiment., SETTING: Italy during the April 2020 lockdown., PARTICIPANTS: 566 Italian residents., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence; the predictive and diagnostic accuracy of the test; the behavioural impact of (positive vs negative) test results; the perceived usefulness of a short-term repetition of the test following positive or negative results; and rankings of causes for false positives and false negatives., RESULTS: Most participants considered the swab test useful (89.6%) and provided predictive values consistent with their estimates of test diagnostic accuracy and infection prevalence (67.0%). Participants acknowledged the effects of symptomatic status and geographical location on prevalence (all p<0.001) but failed to take this information into account when estimating the positive or negative predictive value. Overall, test specificity was underestimated (91.5%, 95% CI 90.2% to 92.8%); test sensitivity was overestimated (89.7%, 95% CI 88.3% to 91.0%). Positive results were evaluated as more informative than negative ones (91.6, 95% CI 90.2 to 93.1 and 41.0, 95% CI 37.9 to 44.0, respectively, p<0.001); a short-term repetition of the test was considered more useful after a positive than a negative result (62.7, 95% CI 59.6 to 65.7 and 47.2, 95% CI 44.4 to 50.0, respectively, p=0.013). Human error and technical characteristics were assessed as more likely to be the causes of false positives (p<0.001); the level of the viral load as the cause of false negatives (p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: While some aspects of the swab for SARS-CoV-2 are well grasped, others are not and may have a strong bearing on the general public's health and well-being. The obtained findings provide policymakers with a detailed picture that can guide the design and implementation of interventions for improving efficient communication with the general public as well as adherence to precautionary behaviour.

0	COVID-19 in IBD: The experience of a single tertiary IBD center. BACKGROUND: Italy has been one of the most affected countries in the world by COVID-19. There has been increasing concern regarding the impact of COVID-19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in patients treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. The aim of our study is to understand the incidence of COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with IBD. Furthermore, we analyzed possible risk factors for infection and severity of COVID-19., METHODS: This was an observational study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients in a single tertiary center. A 23 multiple-choice-question anonymous survey was administered to 1200 patients with IBD between March 10th and June 10th 2020., RESULTS: 1158 questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of patients had Crohn's disease (CD) (60%) and most of them were in clinical remission. Among the 26 patients (2.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19, only 5 (3CD) were on biological treatment and none required hospitalization. Two patients died and were on treatment with mesalazine only. Of the 1158 patients, 521 were on biological therapy, which was discontinued in 85 (16.3%) and delayed in 195 patients (37.4%). A worsening of IBD symptoms was observed in 200 patients on biological therapy (38.4%). Most of these patients, 189 (94.5%), had stopped or delayed biological treatment, while 11 (5.5%) had continued their therapy regularly (p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in line with the current literature and confirm a higher incidence compared to the general population. Biological therapy for IBD seems to not be a risk factor for infection and should not be discontinued in order to avoid IBD relapse. Copyright © 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

0	Precision Mapping of COVID-19 Vulnerable Locales by Epidemiological and Socioeconomic Risk Factors, Developed Using South Korean Data. COVID-19 has severely impacted socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. To support pandemic control strategies, geographically weighted negative binomial regression (GWNBR) mapped COVID-19 risk related to epidemiological and socioeconomic risk factors using South Korean incidence data (January 20, 2020 to July 1, 2020). We constructed COVID-19-specific socioeconomic and epidemiological themes using established social theoretical frameworks and created composite indexes through principal component analysis. The risk of COVID-19 increased with higher area morbidity, risky health behaviours, crowding, and population mobility, and with lower social distancing, healthcare access, and education. Falling COVID-19 risks and spatial shifts over three consecutive time periods reflected effective public health interventions. This study provides a globally replicable methodological framework and precision mapping for COVID-19 and future pandemics.	false
0	Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protection against coronavirus-associated pneumonia hospitalization in children living with and without HIV. In December 2019 a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged as a human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. There are few data on human coronavirus infections among individuals living with HIV. In this study we probed the role of pneumococcal coin-fections with seasonal CoVs among children living with and without HIV hospitalized for pneumonia. We also described the prevalence and clinical manifestations of these infections. A total of 39,836 children who participated in a randomized, dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) were followed for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations until 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at the time of hospitalization and were screened by PCR for four seasonal CoVs. The frequency of CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in children living with HIV (19.9%) than in those without HIV (7.6%, P < 0.001). Serial CoV infections were detected in children living with HIV. The case fatality risk among children with CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in those living with HIV (30.4%) than without HIV (2.9%, P = 0.001). C-re-active protein and procalcitonin levels were elevated in 36.8% (>=40 mg/liter) and 64.7% (>=0.5 ng/ml), respectively, of the fatal cases living with HIV. Among children without HIV, there was a 64.0% (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.2%) lower incidence of CoV-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among PCV9 recipients compared to placebo recipients. These data suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae infections might have a role in the development of pneumonia associated with endemic CoVs, that PCV may prevent pediatric CoV-associated hospitalization, and that children living with HIV with CoV infections develop more severe outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Nunes et al.	false
0	Safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine formulations in healthy adults: a randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. <h4>Background: </h4> Effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed. CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations. <h4>Methods: </h4> This Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study ( NCT04537208 ) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and ≥50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 μg) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 μg) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples. Findings The interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03- versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata. Interpretation The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.

0	Interferon-regulated genetic programs and JAK/STAT pathway activate the intronic promoter of the short ACE2 isoform in renal proximal tubules. <h4>Summary</h4> Recently, a short, interferon-inducible isoform of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), dACE2 was identified. ACE2 is a SARS-Cov-2 receptor and changes in its renal expression have been linked to several human nephropathies. These changes were never analyzed in context of dACE2 , as its expression was not investigated in the kidney. We used Human Primary Proximal Tubule (HPPT) cells to show genome-wide gene expression patterns after cytokine stimulation, with emphasis on the ACE2/dACE2 locus. Putative regulatory elements controlling dACE2 expression were identified using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. qRT-PCR differentiating between ACE2 and dACE2 revealed 300- and 600-fold upregulation of dACE2 by IFNα and IFNβ, respectively, while full length ACE2 expression was almost unchanged. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib ablated STAT1 and dACE2 expression after interferon treatment. Finally, with RNA-seq, we identified a set of genes, largely immune-related, induced by cytokine treatment. These gene expression profiles provide new insights into cytokine response of proximal tubule cells.	false
0	Low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility for hospital staff: Prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks?. BACKGROUND: The ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 4.7 million infections greatly challenging healthcare workers (HCW) and medical institutions worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown to significantly impact mental and physical health of HCW. Thus, implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW are urgently needed. METHOD(S): A low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, in March 2020. Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore, employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 h. Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded. RESULT(S): Between 9th March and April 30, 2020, a total of 1510 employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing facility. One percent (n = 11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18% being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%). Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. After risk contact tracking by the hospital hygiene 6 patient-to-employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact to 55 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. CONCLUSION(S): In the absence of easily accessible public SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected employees with absent or mild symptoms, thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable hospital environments. High levels of professional infection prevention training and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital hygiene network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic setting.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

0	Pragmatic, open-label, single-center, randomized, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus in patients with severe pneumonia secondary to COVID-19: the TACROVID trial protocol. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Introduction</h4> Some COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature ≤ 37.5°C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate ≤24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours. <h4>Discussion</h4> Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries. <h4>Trial registration number</h4> NCT04341038 / EudraCT: 2020-001445-39	false
0	Clinical characteristics and outcome of influenza virus infection among adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study from Wuhan, China. <h4>Background: </h4> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that rapidly spreads worldwide and co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza may occur in some cases. We aimed to describe clinical features and outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with co-infection of influenza virus.MethodsRetrospective cohort study was performed and a total of 140 patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled in designated wards of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Feb 8th and March 15th in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The demographic, clinical features, laboratory indices, treatment and outcomes of these patients were collected.ResultsOf 140 severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients, including 73 patients (52.14%) with median age 62 years were influenza virus IgM-positive and 67 patients (47.86%) with median age 66 years were influenza virus IgM-negative. 76 (54.4%) of severe COVID-19 patients were males. Chronic comorbidities consisting mainly of hypertension (45.3%), diabetes (15.8%), chronic respiratory disease (7.2%), cardiovascular disease (5.8%), malignancy (4.3%) and chronic kidney disease (2.2%). Clinical features, including fever (≥38°C), chill, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea and fatigue or myalgia were collected. Fatigue or myalgia was less found in COVID-19 patients with IgM-positive (33.3% vs 50/7%, P = 0.0375). Higher proportion of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 42 s was observed in COVID-19 patients with influenza virus IgM-negative (43.8% vs 23.6%, P = 0.0127). Severe COVID-19 Patients with influenza virus IgM positive have a higher cumulative survivor rate than that of patients with influenza virus IgM negative (Log-rank P= 0.0308). Considering age is a potential confounding variable, difference in age was adjusted between different influenza virus IgM status groups, the HR was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.081-1.100). Similarly, difference in gender was adjusted as above, the HR was 0.262 (95% CI, 0.072-0.952) in the COX regression model.ConclusionsInfluenza virus IgM positive may be associated with decreasing in-hospital death.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 infected diabetic patients admitted in ICUs of the southern region of Bangladesh. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent among critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with poor outcomes. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the southern region of Bangladesh., METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups., RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51-70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the prevention and prompt treatment of diabetic patients, to maintain good glycaemic control especially those who require insulin therapy.

0	Association between thiamine deficiency and hyperlactatemia among critically ill patients with diabetes infected by SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: Verify the association between diabetes and thiamine deficiency in critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study, whose demographic, anthropometric and laboratory data (arterial lactate, bicarbonate and plasma thiamine) were obtained in the first hours of admission to the intensive care unit. Patients with diabetes were compared with individuals without diabetes and the correlation was performed between thiamine and lactate levels. Thiamine deficiency was considered < 28 mug/L., RESULTS: Overall, 270 patients met the inclusion criteria; 51.1% were men and median age was 74 years (66.8 - 81). The median value of thiamine was 54.0 mug/L (38 - 72.3) and 15.6% had thiamine deficiency. Among patients with diabetes, 26.3% had thiamine deficiency and 69.3% had hyperlactatemia. There was an association between thiamine deficiency and diabetes (OR 4.28; 95% CI 2.08 - 8.81, p < 0.001). There was a strong negative correlation between thiamine and arterial lactate in patients with diabetes (r = - 0.711, p < 0.001) and a moderate negative correlation in critically ill patients without diabetes (r = - 0.489, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of thiamine deficiency in critically ill patients due to COVID-19 is higher in diabetes. There is a negative correlation between thiamine and arterial lactate levels, which is higher in people with diabetes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Detecting COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application: a prospective, observational study. Background: As many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention. Method(s): In this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. Finding(s): From March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2 873 726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2 842 732 (98.9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120 192 306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169 682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15 841 (95% CI 14 023-17 885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0.53% (0.45-0.60), and R(t) of 1.17 (1.15-1.19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data. Interpretation(s): Our method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower. Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

0	Novel Regeneration Approach for Creating Reusable FO-SPR Probes with NTA Surface Chemistry. To date, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have been exploited in numerous different contexts while continuously pushing boundaries in terms of improved sensitivity, specificity, portability and reusability. The latter has attracted attention as a viable alternative to disposable biosensors, also offering prospects for rapid screening of biomolecules or biomolecular interactions. In this context here, we developed an approach to successfully regenerate a fiber-optic (FO)-SPR surface when utilizing cobalt (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) surface chemistry. To achieve this, we tested multiple regeneration conditions that can disrupt the NTA chelate on a surface fully saturated with His6-tagged antibody fragments (scFv-33H1F7) over ten regeneration cycles. The best surface regeneration was obtained when combining 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM imidazole and 0.5% SDS at pH 8.0 for 1 min with shaking at 150 rpm followed by washing with 0.5 M NaOH for 3 min. The true versatility of the established approach was proven by regenerating the NTA surface for ten cycles with three other model system bioreceptors, different in their size and structure: His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment (receptor binding domain, RBD), a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and protein origami carrying 4 RFPs (Tet12SN-RRRR). Enabling the removal of His6-tagged bioreceptors from NTA surfaces in a fast and cost-effective manner can have broad applications, spanning from the development of biosensors and various biopharmaceutical analyses to the synthesis of novel biomaterials.	false
0	Simulating preventative testing of SARS-CoV-2 in schools: policy implications. BACKGROUND: School testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection has become an important policy and planning issue as schools were reopened after the summer season and as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Decisions to test or not to test and, if testing, how many tests, how often and for how long, are complex decisions that need to be taken under uncertainty and conflicting pressures from various stakeholders., METHOD: We have developed an agent-based model and simulation tool that can be used to analyze the outcomes and effectiveness of different testing strategies and scenarios in schools with various number of classrooms and class sizes. We have applied a modified version of a standard SEIR disease transmission model that includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious populations, and that incorporates feasible public health measures. We also incorporated a pre-symptomatic phase for symptomatic cases. Every day, a random number of students in each class are tested. If they tested positive, they are placed in self-isolation at home when the test results are provided. Last but not least, we have included options to allow for full testing or complete self-isolation of a classroom with a positive case., RESULTS: We present sample simulation results for parameter values based on schools and disease related information, in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The findings show that testing can be an effective method in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools if taken frequently, with expedited test results and self-isolation of infected students at home., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that while testing cannot eliminate the risk and has its own challenges, it can significantly control outbreaks when combined with other measures, such as masks and other protective measures.	false
0	The Association Between Chronic Disease and Serious COVID-19 Outcomes and Its Influence on Risk Perception: Survey Study and Database Analysis. BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a viral respiratory disease first reported in December 2019, quickly became a threat to global public health. Further understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk perception of the community may better inform targeted interventions to reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on people's self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes., METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models., RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19-infected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes. It also brings forth a greater understanding of the community's risk perceptions of serious COVID-19 disease. Hence, this study may aid health authorities to better adapt measures to the real needs of the population and to identify vulnerable individuals requiring further education and awareness of preventive measures.

0	Cardiovascular comorbidities and pharmacological treatments of covid-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a whole Earth health emergency related to a highly pathogenic human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between March 9 and May 1, 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described. Result(s): A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54 +/- 17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively. At multivariate regression model, diabetes (risk ratio (RR): 3.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 13.34; p = 0.04) and hypertension (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.7; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the experimental anti-COVID drug administration. Moreover, only diabetes (RR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.8; p = 0.03) was significantly associated with heparin administration. Conclusion(s): Our data show a high prevalence of hypertension, more likely treated with renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS) inhibitors, among COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. Experimental COVID-19 therapies have been prescribed to COVID-19 patients considered at risk for increased venous thromboembolism based on concomitant comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	"Characterizing the COVID-19 Infodemic on Chinese Social Media: Exploratory Study. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 infodemic has been disseminating rapidly on social media and posing a significant threat to people's health and governance systems., OBJECTIVE: This study investigates and analyses the posts related to the COVID-19 misinformation on major Chinese social media to characterize the COVID-19 infodemic., METHODS: We collected posts about the COVID-19 misinformation on major Chinese social media from 20th Jan to 28th May 2020, using the Python toolkit. We used content analysis to identify the quantity and source of posts prevalent around the COVID-19 infodemic and used topic modeling to cluster the theme of the COVID-19 infodemic. Then, we explore the quantity, sources, and theme characteristics of the COVID-19 infodemic over time., RESULTS: The results show that: (1) the daily number of posts related to the COVID-19 infodemic on Chinese social media is positively correlated with the daily number of the newly confirmed cases (r=0.672, P<0.01) and newly suspected cases (r=0.497, P<0.01). (2) The COVID-19 infodemic showed a characteristic of gradual progress, which can be divided into five stages: incubation period, outbreak period, stalemate period, control period, and recovery period. (3) The sources of the COVID-19 infodemic can be divided into five types, namely chat platforms (40.1%), video-sharing platforms (23.4%), news-sharing platforms (22.1%), healthcare communities (8.7%), and Q&A communities (5.7%), which were slightly different at each stage. (4) The themes of COVID-19 infodemic were clustered into eight categories, namely ""conspiracy theories"" (23.6%), ""government response"" (19.8%), ""prevention action"" (15.0%), ""new cases"" (13.3%), ""transmission routes"" (8.9%), ""origin and nomenclature"" (8.3%), ""vaccines and medicines"" (5.6%), and ""symptoms and detection"" (5.5%), which were prominently diverse in different stages. Additionally, the COVID-19 infodemic showed a characteristic of repeated fluctuations., CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the COVID-19 infodemic on Chinese social media was characterized by gradual progress, videoizing, and repeated fluctuations. We were able to show that the COVID-19 infodemic is paralleled to the propagation of the COVID-19 epidemic. We have tracked the COVID-19 infodemic across Chinese social media, providing critical new insights into the characteristics of infodemic and pointing out opportunities for preventing and controlling the COVID-19 infodemic."	false
0	Substance use treatment in Appalachian Tennessee amid COVID-19: Challenges and preparing for the future. The COVID-19 pandemic created a number of rapidly emerging and unprecedented challenges for those engaged in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, forcing service providers to improvise their treatment strategies as the crisis deepened. Drawing from five ongoing federally funded SUD projects in Appalachian Tennessee and hundreds of hours of meetings and interviews, this article explores the pandemic's impact on an already structurally disadvantaged region, its recovery community, and those who serve it. More specifically, we note detrimental effects of increased isolation since the implementation of COVID-19 safety measures, including stakeholders' reports of higher incidences of relapse, overdose, and deaths in the SUD population. Treatment providers have responded with telehealth services, but faced barriers in technology access and computer literacy among clients. Providers have also had to restrict new clients to accommodate social distancing, faced delays in health screening those they can accept, and denied family visitations, which has affected retention. In light of these challenges, several promising lessons for the future emerged--such as preparing for an influx of new and returning clients in need of SUD treatment; making arrangements for long-term housing and facility modification; developing a hybrid care delivery model, taking advantage of new regulations enabling telemedicine; budgeting for and storing personal protective equipment (PPE) and related supplies; and developing disaster protocols to withstand threats to intake, retention, and financial solvency.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"Higher comorbidities and early death in hospitalized African-American patients with Covid-19. BACKGROUND: African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a 52-day period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population., RESULTS: Of the 1103 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 529 required hospitalization and were included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (52%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the ""obese"" range. 98% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (79%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (56%) and chronic kidney disease (17%). Patients with chronic kidney disease who received hemodialysis were found to have lower mortality, than those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis Age > 60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (8.3:10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 h. Of the 529 inpatients 48% died, and one third of them died within the first 3 days of admission. 159/529patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 86% died and of the remaining 370 patients, 30% died., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher in-hospital mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients."	false
0	Perceived interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services associated with COVID-19 for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in 20 countries. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has necessitated a range of population-based measures in order to stem the spread of infection. These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 control measures and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM., SETTING: Data for this study were collected between 16-Apr-2020 and 24-May-2020 as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app, Hornet. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index: each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to restrictions, closures, and travel bans., METHODS: We used a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model with Poisson distribution to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services., RESULTS: A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included. 38% (3992/10396) reported perceived interruptions to in-person testing, 55% (5178/9335) interruptions to HIV self-testing, 56% (5171/9173) interruptions to PrEP, and 10% (990/9542) interruptions to condom access. For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of perceived access to in-person testing (aPR: 0.97, 95%CI: [0.96, 0.98]), a 6% reduction in access to self-testing (aPR: 0.94, 95%CI: [0.93, 0.95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0.95, 95% CI: [0.95, 0.97]). Among those living with HIV, 20% (218/1105) were unable to access their provider; 65% (820/1254) reported being unable to refill their treatment prescription remotely., CONCLUSION: More stringent responses were associated with decreased perceived access to services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to minimize service interruptions to the community of gay men and other MSM during this and future waves of COVID-19.

0	A national retrospective cohort study of mechanical ventilator availability and its association with mortality risk in intensive care patients with COVID-19. <h4>Objectives: </h4> To determine if there is an association between survival rates in intensive care units (ICU) and occupancy of the unit on the day of admission. <h4>Design:</h4> National retrospective observational cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Setting:</h4> 90 English hospital trusts (i.e. groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units). Participants: 6,686 adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2nd April and 1st December, 2020 (inclusive), with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria. Interventions: N/A Main Outcomes and Measures: A Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible) bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded chronic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, liver disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, neurological disease, renal disease). <h4>Results:</h4> 121,151 patient-days were observed, with a mortality rate of 20.8 per 1,000 patient days. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy (>85% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 to 85%) [OR 1.18 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.00 to 1.38)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy (<45% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.79 (95% PCI: 0.69 to 0.90)]. Conclusion and Relevance: Increasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Public health interventions (such as expeditious vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions) to control both incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, and therefore keep ICU occupancy low in the context of the pandemic, are necessary to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.

0	Estimated number of N95 respirators needed for healthcare workers in acute care hospitals during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Objective: Due to shortages of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to estimate the number of N95s required for healthcare workers (HCW) to inform manufacturing targets and resource allocation. Method(s): We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute care hospital and the United States. Result(s): For an acute care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% IPR: 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR: 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases (22 [95% IPR: 10-43]-4,445 [95% IPR: 1,975-8,684]) if each N95 is used for five patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR: 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR: 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5-90% of the population is exposed (single-use), and 17.4 million (95% IPR: 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR: 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for five encounters. Conclusion(s): Our study quantifies the number of N95 respirators needed for a given acute care hospital and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic under varying conditions.Copyright © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

0	Prospective cohort study of children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting to paediatric emergency departments: a Paediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) Study Protocol. INTRODUCTION: Relatively limited data are available regarding paediatric COVID-19. Although most children appear to have mild or asymptomatic infections, infants and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of experiencing more severe illness and requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The recent but uncommon association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has heightened the importance of understanding paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Paediatric Emergency Research Network-COVID-19 cohort study is a rapid, global, prospective cohort study enrolling 12 500 children who are tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 47 emergency departments across 12 countries on four continents will participate. At enrolment, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results, all children will have the same information collected, including clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, imaging and outcome data. Interventions and outcome data will be collected for hospitalised children. For all children, follow-up at 14 and 90 days will collect information on further medical care received, and long-term sequelae, respectively. Statistical models will be designed to identify risk factors for infection and severe outcomes., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Sites will seek ethical approval locally, and informed consent will be obtained. There is no direct risk or benefit of study participation. Weekly interim analysis will allow for real-time data sharing with regional, national, and international policy makers. Harmonisation and sharing of investigation materials with WHO, will contribute to synergising global efforts for the clinical characterisation of paediatric COVID-19. Our findings will enable the implementation of countermeasures to reduce viral transmission and severe COVID-19 outcomes in children., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04330261.

0	Impact of chronic exposure to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors on the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19: a case-control study in male population from two COVID-19 regional centers of Lombardy (Italy). BACKGROUND: There are sex differences in vulnerability to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The coronavirus S protein mediates viral entry into target cells employing the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming. The TMPRSS2 gene expression is responsive to androgen stimulation and it could partially explain sex differences. We hypothesized that men chronically exposed to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have a lower risk of hospitalization for COVID-19., METHODS: This is a population-based case-control study on consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus who required hospitalization for COVID-19 (cases), age-matched to beneficiaries of the Lombardy Regional Health Service (controls). Data were collected by two high-volume COVID-19 regional centers of Lombardy (Italy). The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of patients chronically exposed to 5ARIs, who required hospitalization for COVID-19, with the one of controls., RESULTS: Overall, 943 males were enrolled; 45 (4.77%) were exposed to 5ARI. COVID-19 patients aged >55 years under 5ARI treatment were significantly less than expected on the basis of the prevalence of 5ARI treatment among age-matched controls (5.57 vs. 8.14%; p=0.0083, 95%CI=0.75-3.97%). This disproportion was higher for men aged >65 (7.14 vs. 12.31%; p=0.0001, 95%CI=2.83-6.97%). Eighteen 5ARIs-patients died; the mean age of men who died was higher than those who did not: 75.98+/-9.29 vs. 64.78+/-13.57 (p<0.001). Cox-regression and multivariable models did not show correlation between 5ARIs exposure and protection against intensive care unit admission/death., CONCLUSIONS: Men exposed to 5ARIs might be less vulnerable to severe COVID-19, supporting its use in disease prophylaxis.	false
0	Routine saliva testing for the identification of silent COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers. Objective: Current COVID-19 guidelines recommend symptom-based screening and regular nasopharyngeal (NP) testing for healthcare personnel in high-risk settings. We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. Design(s): Simulation modelling study. Method(s): We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic COVID-19 cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the pre-symptomatic stage. Result(s): Routine bi-weekly NP testing, once every two weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD: 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD: 0.98) during the pre-symptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD: 0.18) and 32.9% (SD: 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified about 10% more cases (mean: 42.5%; SD: 1.10) during the pre-symptomatic stage. Conclusion(s): Our findings highlight the utility of routine non-invasive saliva testing for frontline healthcare workers to protect vulnerable patient populations. A 5-day saliva testing schedule should be considered to help identify silent infections and prevent outbreaks in nursing homes and healthcare facilities.Copyright © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

0	Rhabdomyolysis is Associated with In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19. PURPOSE: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) has been associated with many viral infectious diseases, and associated with poor outcomes. We aim to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis (RM) in patients with COVID-19., METHOD: This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of 1,014 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between February 17 and April 12, 2020., RESULTS: The overall incidence of RM was 2.2%. Compared with patients without RM, those with RM tended to have a higher risk of deterioration. Patients with RM also constituted a greater percentage of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (90.9% vs 5.3%, P < 0.001) and a greater percentage of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (86.4% vs 2.7% P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with RM had laboratory test abnormalities, including the presence of markers of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and kidney injury. Patients with RM also had a higher risk of in-hospital death (P < 0.001). Cox's proportional hazard regression model analysis confirmed that RM indicators, including peak creatine kinase (CK) levels > 1000 IU/L (HR = 6.46, 95% CI: 3.02-13.86) and peak serum myoglobin (MYO) concentrations > 1000 ng/mL (HR = 9.85, 95% CI: 5.04-19.28), were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 that developed RM tended to have delayed viral clearance., CONCLUSION: RM might be an important contributing factor to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The early detection and effective intervention of RM may help reduce mortality among COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2021 by the Shock Society.	false
0	A virtual-hybrid approach to launching a cardio-oncology clinic during a pandemic. BACKGROUND: As cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in cancer survivors, the new subspecialty of Cardio-Oncology has emerged to address prevention, monitoring, and management of cardiovascular toxicities to cancer therapies. During the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we developed a Virtual-Hybrid Approach to build a de novo Cardio-Oncology Clinic., METHODS: We conceptualized a Virtual-Hybrid Approach including three arms: information seeking in locations with existing Cardio-Oncology clinics, information gathering at the location for a new clinic, and information sharing to report clinic-building outcomes. A retrospective review of outcomes included collection and synthesis of data from our first 3 months (at pandemic peak) on types of appointments, cancers, drugs, and cardiotoxicities. Data were presented using descriptive statistics., RESULTS: A de-novo Cardio-Oncology clinic was developed structured from the ground up to integrate virtual and in-person care in a hybrid and innovative model, using the three arms of the Virtual-Hybrid Approach. First, we garnered in-person and virtual preparation through hands-on experiences, training, and discussions in existing Cardio-Oncology Clinics and conferences. Next, we gleaned information through virtual inquiry and niche-building. With partners throughout the institution, a virtual referral process was established for outpatient referrals and inpatient e-consult referrals to actualize a hybrid care spectrum for our patients administered by a multidisciplinary hybrid care team of clinicians, ancillary support staff, and clinical pharmacists. Among the multi-subspecialty clinic sessions, approximately 50% were in Cardio-Oncology, 20% in Preventive Cardiology, and 30% in General Cardiology. In the hybrid model, the Heart & Vascular Center had started to re-open, allowing for 65% of our visits to be in person. In additional analyses, the most frequent cardiovascular diagnosis was cardiomyopathy (34%), the most common cancer drug leading to referral was trastuzumab (29%), and the most prevalent cancer type was breast cancer (42%)., CONCLUSION: This Virtual-Hybrid Approach and retrospective review provides guidance and information regarding initiating a brand-new Cardio-Oncology Clinic during the pandemic for cancer patients/survivors. This report also furnishes virtual resources for patients, virtual tools for oncologists, cardiologists, and administrators tasked with starting new clinics during the pandemic, and innovative future directions for this digital pandemic to post-pandemic era.	false
0	Diagnostic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of laboratory diagnostics to reduce the spread of SARSCoV-2 and to treat patients with severe coronaviral disease. The situation required a rapid development of molecular and serological tests to enable mass screening, testing of high-risk groups, and establishing epidemiological data. Knowledge of diagnostic methods is continuously evolving, so it is crucial to understand the nature of the tests and to be able to interpret their results. This review discusses the current literature on diagnostic methods, prognostic markers, diagnostic recommendations, choice of the appropriate test, type of biological material, and interpretation of results depending on test sensitivity and disease duration. Also, the percentage of positive results in the selected countries at two distant time points of the epidemic was analyzed. Further development of diagnostic techniques and incorporation of new technologies can provide more accurate and faster tools for control the epidemic.	false
0	Can Outpatient Plastic Surgery Be Done Safely During a COVID-19 Surge? Results of a July 2020 Los Angeles Survey and Literature Review. BACKGROUND: A moratorium was placed on nonurgent surgery throughout much of the United States in mid-March 2020 due to surging numbers of COVID-19 cases. Several months later, and with new safety precautions in place, elective surgery gradually resumed. However, no data exist on the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): This aim of this survey was to assess the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic by quantifying: (1) the preoperative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2; (2) the risk of postoperative COVID-19; (3) outcomes and precious resource utilization for such cases; and (4) the risks to office staff. METHOD(S): Los Angeles plastic surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) were sent an online survey in July 2020, during a local COVID-19 surge, querying about the number of procedures performed in the 8- to 10-week period since reopening, testing policies, surgical complications, and cases among staff. RESULT(S): In total, 112 surgeons reported 5633 surgeries since resuming elective surgery. Of these, 103 (91.96%) surgeons obtained a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for every patient. The preoperative PCR test was positive in 41/5881 (0.69%). Positive tests within 2 weeks postoperation occurred in 7/5380 (0.13%) of surgical patients, 3/8506 (0.04%) of injection patients, and 6/2519 (0.24%) of energy therapy patients. Nine offices reported at least 1 staff member who developed COVID-19. All cases were mild, with no hospitalizations or deaths. CONCLUSION(S): These data demonstrate that plastic surgery can be performed safely during a COVID-19 surge by ABPS diplomates. This has profound impact for patients, plastic surgeons, and health policy regulators.Copyright © 2020 The Aesthetic Society. Reprints and permission: journals.permissions@oup.com.	false
0	Risk Factors, Clinical Characteristics, and Prognosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication of COVID-19. Methods: Records of hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 March to 31 May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of 283 patients, AKI occurred in 40.6%. From multivariate analyses, the risk factors of AKI in COVID-19 can be divided into: (1) demographics/co-morbidities (male, increasing age, diabetes, chronic kidney disease); (2) other organ involvements (transaminitis, elevated troponin I, ST segment/T wave change on electrocardiography); (3) elevated biomarkers (ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase); (4) possible bacterial co-infection (leukocytosis, elevated procalcitonin); (5) need for advanced oxygen delivery (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, mechanical ventilation); and (6) other critical features (ICU admission, need for vasopressors, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Most AKIs were due to pre-renal (70.4%) and intrinsic (34.8%) causes. Renal replacement therapy was more common in intrinsic AKI. Both pre-renal (HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.7-5.9) and intrinsic AKI (HR 7.7; 95% CI 3.6-16.3) were associated with higher mortality. Male, stage 3 AKI, higher baseline and peak serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were prevalent in intrinsic AKI. Urine analysis and the fractional excretion of sodium and urea were not helpful in distinguishing intrinsic AKI from other causes. Conclusions: AKI is very common in COVID-19 and is associated with higher mortality. Characterization of AKI is warranted due to its diverse nature and clinical outcome.	false
0	Molecular Diagnostic Tools for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally infected more than 50 million people and ~1.2 million have succumbed to this deadly pathogen. With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection.	false
0	Self-care of frontline health care workers: During covid-19 pandemic. The world is amidst the COVID-19 pandemic that has used social distancing as a tool for containing the virus from spreading exponentially among other individuals. Previous literature suggests that human contact and attachment is a key for well-being which is why punishments like solitary confinement in detention centers like jail has always been debated as being torturous (Wolfendal 2020). With this notion, anxiety and stress may become more prevalent in individuals who experience self-isolation or are under a forced lockdown. For health-care workers like doctors and psychologists, who advocate for physical health, mental health and wellbeing; the challenges might increase during the pandemic phase as they are expected to go through the crises just like others while simultaneously contributing in rendering services related to dealing with physical and psychological health issues present in patients and clients with their continued practice from either on-site or online platforms. Although all health care professional's training inoculates the ill effects of compassion fatigue by other's overwhelming situations and discussions but they might still be prone to vicarious burnout, trauma and stress. Hence, they may become exposed to being at risk of experiencing anxiety more than the general population. This review discusses facets of the importance of self-care as mental health first aid tool for health care professionals including doctors and psychologists using research and supportive techniques to help them process stress and anxiety during and after the global pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

0	Operational experience of the Dutch helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: jeopardy on the prehospital care system?. PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has disrupted global and local medical supply chains. To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13th, 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior., METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described., RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8-53)., CONCLUSION: A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior. These findings highlight the importance of continued operability of the HEMS, even during pandemic circumstances., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective comparative study.	false
0	Urgent Arthroplasty Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Operating Risks in Low-Prevalence Areas. Background and objective Orthopaedic services have reorganised their delivery of care in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. In this study, we aimed to share our operating experience during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and analyse its effect on urgent hip and knee arthroplasty. Our study involved a comparative analysis between a cohort of patients from 2019 (pre-COVID) and another from 2020. Methods Tha data relating to patients undergoing urgent operations requiring arthroplasty interventions such as for infection, periprosthetic fracture (PPF) and neck of femur fracture (NOF) between April and July of 2020 and 2019 were reviewed prospectively and retrospectively. Patients were categorised according to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) case prioritisation and the COVID-19 risk assessment. Data were collected on 30-day mortality, readmissions, reoperations, complications, length of hospital stay and theatre efficiency. This was analysed, matched and compared. Statistical analysis was performed on categorical variables including the time to the theatre as well as dual consultant operating. Results A total of 46 consecutive patients were included in the 2020 cohort with a mean age of 78 years (range: 58108 years). The median length of stay was 6.5 days (range: 3-35 days) and the median time to theatre for NOF patients was 23.8 hours (range: 16.2-87.7 hours). There were six complications and two deaths; one of the deaths was COVID-19-related. A total of 56 patients were included from 2019 with a mean age of 74.6 years (range: 45-88 years). The median length of stay was five days (range: 1-18 days) and the median time to theatre for NOF patients was 40.8 hours (range: 18.9-167 hours). There were four complications and one death. Conclusion Based on our findings, it is safe to perform complex surgery in a region of low community prevalence of COVID-19, and the outcomes were comparable to those from a pre-COVID-19 cohort.	false
0	Study protocol for COVID-RV: a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of right ventricular dysfunction in ventilated patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 can cause severe acute respiratory failure requiring management in intensive care unit with invasive ventilation and a 40% mortality rate. Cardiovascular manifestations are common and studies have shown an increase in right ventricular (RV) dysfunction associated with mortality. These studies, however, comprise heterogeneous patient groups with few requiring invasive ventilation. This study will investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of RV dysfunction in ventilated patients with COVID-19 which may lead to targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective multicentre observational cohort study will perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 150 patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive ventilation for more than 48 hours. RV dysfunction will be defined as TTE evidence of RV dilatation along with the presence of septal flattening. Baseline demographics, disease severity data and clinical information relating to proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) will be collected and analysed.Primary outcome measures include the prevalence of RV dysfunction and its association with 30-day mortality. Exploratory outcome measures will investigate the association of the proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction to the primary outcomes.Prevalence of RV dysfunction will be determined along with 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs and 30-day survival will be analysed using logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics, phase of disease and baseline severity of illness. The role of potential aetiological factors (ARDS, disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) in relation to the primary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was gained from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 20/SS/0059). Findings will be disseminated by various methods including webinars, international presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Case series of 20 pregnant women with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China. AIM: To evaluate perinatal outcomes regarding clinical presentation in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19., METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were retrospectively reviewed from 20 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and The Third Hospital of Wuhan, from Jan 20 to Mar 16, 2020, including three in the first-trimester, two in the second-trimester, and 15 in the third-trimester. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for neonatal throat swab samples. The pathological changes of COVID-19 on the placenta is evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining., RESULTS: The most common symptoms of the pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were fever and cough, which is comparable to the nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 infection. Nobody was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment and there were no maternal and neonatal deaths. However, there was one case with induced abortions on first-trimester (due to pregnant woman's concerns about COVID-19), one diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, no intrauterine fetal deaths during the study period. Delivery occurred in 15 patients in the third trimester. Their incidence of preterm birth was 20%. Three of the four preterm births were spontaneous. The average length of stay was 20.77 days. No neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected. There were two placentas found with acute chorioamnionitis, one showed normal placenta morphology., CONCLUSION: In this case series study, COVID-19 had no short-term adverse effect on pregnant women except premature birth.

0	A considerable asymptomatic proportion and thromboembolism risk of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China. Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a worldwide pandemic, however, information is limited on the asymptomatic proportion and thromboembolism risk of pregnant women with infection., Methods: All 32 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan during the outbreak from January 20 to March 18, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed for the clinical records, laboratory tests, chest CT scans, and neonatal outcomes., Results: There were 17 of the 32 patients (53%) with no subjective symptoms before admission, and 13 (41%) remained asymptomatic throughout hospitalization. There were 28 patients (88%) showing typical radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest CT. The patients with COVID-19 were found in an increased risk of thromboembolism with much higher D-dimer levels than uninfected pregnant women. One neonate with asphyxia and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was reported., Conclusions: The considerable asymptomatic proportion of pregnant women with COVID-19 indicates symptom-based screening would miss a number of cases. Chest CT could provide a useful screening resource during the COVID-19epidemic outbreak. Anticoagulation therapy for the postpartum patients may be helpful for good prognosis. The findings provide important information for the hospital isolation, control strategies and clinical therapy.	false
0	Principles and new perspectives in the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has been a year since the first person on Earth became infected with a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing infectious acute respiratory disease COVID-19 with relatively high morbidity and mortality. The most endangered population by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are healthcare professionals, the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. Due to the fast community spread, governments of different European countries introduced precaution measures including limited socializing of people, closing of most public services and introducing mandatory facial protection. The hope for a return to the life before the pandemic is the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which would presumably reduce the incidence of severe forms of COVID-19 and prevent the massive spread of the disease. At the end of November, we have 13 clinical trials in phase III involving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on inactivated viruses, recombinant non-pathogenic viral vectors and proteins. The first mRNA-based vaccine is currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trial and is already being distributed and applied to high-risk population in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel, followed by the countries of the European Union, including the Czech Republic. In the review article we present currently ongoing clinical studies with a special focus on the phase III clinical trials and discuss the mechanisms of action of each type of vaccine.	false
0	COVID-19 and acute kidney injury. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019 and has affected millions of lives worldwide, while many aspects of the illness are still unknown. Current data show that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from kidney damage, in the form of proteinuria, hematuria or acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is especially prevalent among severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients and is a predictor of mortality. The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is unclear. Early reports of histopathologic examination from autopsied kidney tissue show SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in renal tubular cells and podocytes, suggesting direct viral infection, as well as findings of acute tubular necrosis, while rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI and glomerulopathies may also occur. As of today, only remdesivir has been authorized to treat COVID-19. Ongoing research investigates potential of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents along with safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed drugs such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers. This review discusses the prevalence of AKI and its association with outcome, while highlighting possible mechanisms of AKI and suggesting organ protective measures to prevent the development of kidney damage.	false
0	Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using potential point-of-care electrochemical immunosensor: Toward the future prospects. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed.	false
0	COVID-19 and Pulmonary Hypertension in Children: What Do We Know So Far?. The interplay between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in children is unknown. Adults with PH are at potential risk for severe complications and high mortality due to associated comorbidities. It is difficult to extrapolate the outcomes of COVID-19 in adults to pediatric PH patients. Overall, a small number of COVID-19 cases is reported in patients with preexisting PH. Several factors may be responsible for the low incidence of COVID-19 in children with PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease, testing is not universal, and patients may have followed more rigorously the Center for Disease Control's guidelines recommended for personal protection with mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand sanitization through ongoing health education. The small number of COVID-19 cases in patients with preexisting PH does not support that PH is protective for COVID-19. However, medications used to treat PH may have some protection against COVID-19. This review discusses the pathophysiology of PH occurring with COVID-19, differences between children and adults with COVID-19, strategies for management of preexisting PH in children during the ongoing pandemic, and its impact within the field of PH.	false
0	The effect of COVID-19 on donation habits of donors. Background/Case Studies: Blood centers (BC) rely on collections at schools and businesses. Shelter-in-place orders issued in 2020 due to COVID-19 closed these facilities. Additional donor campaigns were conducted to ensure adequate blood supplies during the pandemic. Testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for all allogenic donations was implemented 05/18/20. This study was to determine how COVID-19 affected the donation habits of donors. Study Design/Methods: Three time periods were reviewed [May to June of 2018 vs. 2019 (control), May to June 2019 vs.2020 (study group)]. The following were reviewed: first-time, repeat, and lapsed donors (no donation > 2 years), gender, age, ethnicity, and ABO blood groups. Results/Findings: There were 264,593 donations. In 2020 there was a significant increase in total donations [2019-20 p=<.0001, 2018-19 p = 0.683] and by gender [2019-20 M p= 0.004, F p= <0.0001, 2018-19 M p=0.716, F p= 0.657]. In 2019-20 for the three largest ethnicities there was a significant decrease in Hispanic (p= 0.001) and African American (p <0.0001) and a significant increase in Caucasian (p<0.0001) donations. This was nonsignificant in 2018-19 [African American p=0.415, Hispanic p=0.620, Caucasian p = 0.685]. There was a significant increase in first-time (p<0.0001) and lapsed donors (p<0.0001) in 2019-20 compared with 2018-19 [first-time, p= 0.087, lapsed p=0.308] not seen in repeat donors [2018-19 p=0.730, 2019-20 p = 0.705]. The mean donor age increased significantly in 2019-20 (p=0.024) compared to 2018-19 (p=0.904). In 2019-20 there was a significant decrease in the percentage of donors < 30 years [2019-20 16-20 p<0.0001, 21-30 p<0.0001 vs. 2018-19 16-20 p=0.053, 21-30 p= 0.464]. There was also a significant increase in all blood types in 2020 [19-20 all blood types p<0.0001, 18-19 O+ p=0.621, Op= 0.724, A+ p=0.774, A- p=0.986, B+ p=0.176, Bp= 0.665, AB+ p=0.840, AB- p=0.395]. Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes occurred in the donation habits of donors in 2020 when compared to the control group. Additional donor campaigns and testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may explain the increase in total donations as well as first-time and lapsed donors and among all blood types. The significant decrease in donors < age 30 years may be caused by the closure of educational facilities. Changes in the three largest ethnicities could not be explained.	false

0	Functionalized terahertz plasmonic metasensors: Femtomolar-level detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Effective and efficient management of human betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required sensitive and selective sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing desired diagnostics. In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection.

0	Acquired factor V inhibitor in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Factor V inhibitors are a rare cause of life-threatening bleeding. We present a case of an acquired factor V inhibitor likely caused by coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Bleeding was manifested by severe anemia requiring frequent red-cell transfusion, left psoas muscle hematoma, and left retroperitoneal cavity hematoma. Factor V activity was less than 1% and the factor V inhibitor titer was 31.6 Bethesda units. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA testing of the nasopharynx was positive 2 weeks before presentation and continued to be positive for 30 days. The patient failed treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone. Three cycles of plasmapheresis with fresh frozen plasma replacement resulted in correction of the bleeding and laboratory coagulopathy. This is the first reported case of a factor V inhibitor in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests that plasmapheresis may be a successful treatment strategy.

0	Role of hematological parameters in the stratification of COVID-19 disease severity. Objective: COVID-19 virus involves respiratory as well as other body systems including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, immunological and hematopoietic system. Patient of covid-19 pneumonia presents with wide range of hemostatic abnormalities. These hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 are related with disease progression, severity and mortality. The Objective of our study is to evaluate the role of hematological parameters in determination of COVID-19 disease severity., Material and method: This was a retrospective study, conducted in Department of Pathology and Department of medicine, FMH college of Medicine and Dentistry from May 2020 to July 2020. Total of 101, confirmed cases of covid-19 disease, both genders between 17 and 75-year age were included. Hematological parameters were compared in mild, moderate, severe and critical disease group. Continuous variables were analyzed by using non parametric, Kruskal Wallis test while categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test., Results: Out of 101 patients, 20.8%, 51.8%,19.8% and 7.9% were in mild, moderate, severe and critical group respectively. Median (IQR) values of WBCs (p-value 0.004), ANC (p-value 0.002), NLR (p-value 0.001), D-dimer level (p-value 0.001), ferritin (0.0001), LDH (0.0001) were significantly increased in patients with critical disease. Median (IQR) values of APTT (p-value 0.003) and CRP (p- value 0.0001) were suggestively higher in patients with severe disease. Other parameters like Hemoglobin, MCV, HCT, ALC, Platelet count, prothrombin time did not show statistically significant association with severity of disease., Conclusion: The study concluded that Leukocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, APTT, D-dimer, LDH and serum ferritin and CRP are associated with severity of covid-19 disease.

0	Incomplete humoral response including neutralizing antibodies in asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 patients in Japan. The pandemic of COVID-19 is still ongoing, and many studies on serum antibodies have been reported, however, there are few studies about asymptomatic and mild patients. In this study, we enrolled 44 COVID-19 patients with relatively mild disease and 48 pre-pandemic controls. We measured serum antibodies against extracellular domain, S1 domain, and receptor-binding domain of Spike and N protein, examined neutralization titers by authentic virus neutralization assay and newly-developed bead/cell-based Spike-ACE2 inhibition assay, and compared them with clinical features. Most of these antibodies, including neutralizing titers, were mutually correlated, and the production of antibodies were associated with low Ct values of PCR test, disease severity, symptoms especially pneumonia, lymphopenia, and serological test including CRP, LD, D-dimer, and procalcitonin. Notably, 87.5% of asymptomatic and 23.5% of mild patients did not have antibody against SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed the inadequate acquisition of humoral immunity in patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

0	Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics of Participants in the AgeWell.de Study-A Pragmatic Cluster-Randomized Controlled Lifestyle Trial against Cognitive Decline. Targeting dementia prevention, first trials addressing multiple modifiable risk factors showed promising results in at-risk populations. In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score >= 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored >= 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired. The bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses. However, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.	false
0	Self-organized stem cell-derived human lung buds with proximo-distal patterning and novel targets of SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control 1-2 . Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients 1-3 , how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro -derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo -like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNT hi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type 4 . These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.	false
0	Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after infection. Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines, and for assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at >= 6 months post-infection. IgG to the Spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month post symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4 + T cell, and CD8 + T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.	false
0	Physical rehabilitation in intensive care unit in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The risk of muscle weakness is high in the survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome with COVID-19 following discharge from intensive care unit., AIM: To evaluate the effects of early rehabilitation program in intensive care unit in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Inpatient., POPULATION: Thirty-five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 were enrolled., METHODS: This study was performed in an intensive care unit of a university hospital. Early rehabilitation program consisting of passive or active range of motion exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation in addition to standard intensive care (n=18) compared to standard intensive care (n=17). Primary outcome was hand grip strength following discharge., RESULTS: Rehab group had higher prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases and neurologic diseases. There was no difference in hand grip or manual muscle strength following discharge between rehab and non-rehab groups. No adverse event was noted. CONCLUSIONS : The results did not support the beneficial effects of early rehabilitation in intensive care unit on improving muscle strength. More patients with pulmonary and neurologic diseases in rehab group might impede the impact of rehabilitation on outcomes. On the other hand, these comorbidities underline the role and need of rehabilitation. It is safe both for the patients and the health care workers when necessary precautions are taken., CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This study guide how to rehabilitate patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with COVID-19 during intensive care unit in a safe way.	false

The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (referred to as SARS CoV2) pandemic had a great impact on public life in general as well as on populations with pre-existing disease and co-morbidities. Liver transplant and immunosuppressant medication predisposes to more severe disease and is often associated with poor outcome. The clinical features, disease course, treatment and process of modulating the immunosuppression is challenging. Here, we describe the clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes in six liver transplant recipients. Out of those six patients, three had mild, one had moderate and one had severe COVID-19, and one was asymptomatic. The immunosuppression minimization or withdrawal was done based upon the clinical severity. Consideration of tocilizumab and/o convalescent plasma as well as antivirals i.e. remdesvir done in severe cases. The routine practice of prophylactic anticoagulation, consideration of repurposed drugs (i.e. teicoplanin and doxycycline), and watchful monitoring of asymptomatic recipients helped to achieve an uneventful recovery.

0	Clinical characteristics and impacts of traditional Chinese medicine treatment on the convalescents of COVID-19. Objectives: A significant proportion of discharged COVID-19 patients still have some symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the treatment of COVID-19, but whether it is helpful for discharged patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the impacts of TCM treatment on the convalescents of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 372 COVID-19 convalescents from February 21 to May 3 in Shenzhen, China were retrospectively analyzed, 291 of them accepted clinically examined at least once and 191 convalescents accepted TCM. Results: After retrospective analysis of the clinical data of convalescents accepted TCM treatment or not, we found that the white blood cell count, as well as serum interleukin-6 and procalcitonin decreased in TCM group. Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly decreased, while prealbumin and albumin increased in TCM group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet count increased in TCM group. The mechanisms of TCM treatment might be the overall regulations, including balanced immune response, improved hematopoiesis and coagulation systems, enhanced functions of liver and heart, increased nutrient intake and lipid metabolism. Conclusions: This study suggested that TCM treatment would be beneficial for discharged COVID-19 patients. However, long-term medical observation and further study with randomized trial should be done to confirm this result. Besides, the potential molecular mechanisms of TCM treatment should be further revealed. Copyright © The author(s).	false
0	Rapid generation of durable B cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in COVID-19 and convalescence. Lasting immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection is questioned because serum antibodies decline in convalescence. However, functional immunity is mediated by long-lived memory T and B (Bmem) cells. Therefore, we generated fluorescently-labeled tetramers of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) to determine the longevity and immunophenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells in COVID-19 patients. A total of 36 blood samples were obtained from 25 COVID-19 patients between 4 and 242 days post-symptom onset including 11 paired samples. While serum IgG to RBD and NCP was identified in all patients, antibody levels began declining at 20 days post-symptom onset. RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM+ or IgG1+ and continued to rise until 150 days. RBD-specific IgG+ Bmem were predominantly CD27+, and numbers significantly correlated with circulating follicular helper T cell numbers. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response contracts in convalescence with persistence of RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells. Flow cytometric detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells enables detection of long-term immune memory following infection or vaccination for COVID-19.

0	Prevalence of Alcohol and Tobacco Use in India and Implications for COVID-19 - Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata Study Projections. Abuse of legal substances in India includes alcohol and tobacco, which are the major risk factors for various non-communicable diseases and deaths. The current pandemic has identified tobacco consumption as a risk factor for COVID-19, highlighting the need to control substance abuse. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru. Data of 30,354 participants who abuse tobacco and 30,159 participants who abuse alcohol were collected all over India. The prevalence is estimated at around 8.7% for alcohol abuse and 7.9% for tobacco abuse, Arunachal Pradesh state ranking the highest regarding both alcohol and tobacco abuse, while the Tripura state ranked the lowest. School and college-based mandatory yoga programs need to be implemented to prevent the increase of substance abuse in India to alleviate the psychosocial stress of adolescents and college-going students, besides the installation of the mindfulness-based diabetes yoga protocol (DYP) in the wellness centers of Ayushman Bharat.

0	Suicidal and self-harm ideation among Chinese hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence and correlates. The COVID-19 pandemic put global medical systems under massive pressure for its uncertainty, severity, and persistence. For detecting the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI) and its related risk factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study collected the sociodemographic data, epidemic-related information, the psychological status and need, and perceived stress and support from 11507 staff in 46 hospitals by an online survey from February 14 to March 2, 2020. The prevalence of SSI was 6.47%. Hospital staff with SSI had high family members or relatives infected number and the self-rated probability of infection. Additionally, they had more perceived stress, psychological need, and psychological impact. On the contrary, hospital staff without SSI reported high self-rated health, willingness to work in a COVID-19 ward, confidence in defeating COVID-19, and perceived support. Furthermore, they reported better marital or family relationship, longer sleep hours, and shorter work hours. The infection of family members or relatives, poor marital status, poor self-rated health, the current need for psychological intervention, perceived high stress, perceived low support, depression, and anxiety were independent factors to SSI. A systematic psychological intervention strategy during a public health crisis was needed for the hospital staff's mental well-being.Copyright © 2020	false
0	What the COVID-19 School Closure Left in Its Wake: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Analysis in Japan. To control the spread of COVID-19, the national government of Japan abruptly started the closure of elementary schools on March 2, 2020, but preschools were exempted from this nationwide school closure. Taking advantage of this natural experiment, we examined how the proactive closure of elementary schools affected various outcomes related to children and family well-being. To identify the causal effects of the school closure, we exploited the discontinuity in the probability of not going to school at a certain threshold of age in months and conducted fuzzy regression discontinuity analyses. The data are from a large-scale online survey of mothers whose firstborn children were aged 4 to 10 years. The results revealed a large increase in children's weight and in mothers' anxiety over how to raise their children. On the outcomes related to marital relationships, such as the incidence of domestic violence and the quality of marriage, we did not find statistically significant changes. These findings together suggest that school closures could have large unintended detrimental effects on non-academic outcomes among children. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

0	Analytical methodologies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: Protocols and future perspectives. In March 2020 the World Health Organization announced a pandemic outbreak. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The authorities worldwide use clinical science to identify infected people, but this approach is not able to track all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases due to limited sampling capacity of the testing laboratories. This drawback is eliminated by the Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach. In this review, we summarized the peer-reviewed published literature (available as of September 28, 2020), in the field of WBE. The commonly used steps (sampling, storage, concentration, isolation, detection) of the analytical protocols were identified. The potential limitations of each stage of the protocols and good practices were discussed. Finally, new methods for the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 were proposed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Background/Aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recognized to have variable clinical manifestations. The clinical presentation of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) having COVID-19 is unclear., Methods: We identified articles reporting about the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in those with underlying IBD from PubMed and Embase. The studies, irrespective of design or language, were included. The overall pooled frequency of various symptoms was estimated. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of studies., Results: Eleven studies, including 1,325 patients, were included in the pooled analysis. The pooled estimates for clinical presentation were; fever: 67.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.38-83.88), cough: 59.58% (95% CI, 45.01-72.63), diarrhea: 27.26% (95% CI, 19.51-36.69), running nose: 27% (95% CI, 15.26-43.19) and dyspnea: 25.29% (95% CI, 18.52-33.52). The pooled prevalence rates for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting were 13.08% (95% CI, 9.24-18.19), 10.08% (95% CI, 5.84-16.85) and 8.80% (95% CI, 4.43-16.70) per 100 population, respectively., Conclusions: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in IBD patients is similar to the general population.	false
0	Systemic Coagulopathy in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Coagulation activation has been reported in several cohorts of patients Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the true burden of systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 remains unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database to identify studies that reported the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy using established criteria in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] and/or sepsis-induced coagulopathy [SIC]). Pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using random-effects model. A total of 5 studies including 1210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was 7.1% (95%CI: 3.2%,15.3%, I2 = 93%). The pooled prevalence of DIC (N = 721) and SIC (N = 639) were 4.3% (95%CI 1.7%, 10.4%, I2 = 84%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 9.3%, 26.8%, I2 = 74%), respectively. Only 2 studies reported the prevalence of elevated D-dimer levels with the pooled prevalence of 84.6% (95%CI: 52.0%,96.5%, I2 = 94%). Average D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were remarkably increased, while platelet counts, PT, and aPTT ratios were minimally affected in COVID-19. The estimated prevalence of systemic coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 was low despite D-dimer elevation in most patients. Relatively low systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 may contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis rather than bleeding in patients with COVID-19.	false
0	COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 has been increasingly recognized. However, the clinical features of MIS-C and the differences from Kawasaki disease remain unknown. The study aims to investigate the epidemiology and clinical course of MIS-C. Method(s): PubMed and EMBASE were searched through August 30, 2020. Observational studies describing MIS-C were included. Data regarding demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory, echocardiography and radiology findings, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. Result(s): A total of 27 studies were identified including 917 MIS-C patients. The mean age was 9.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-10.1). The pooled proportions of Hispanic and Black cases were 34.6% (95% CI, 28.3-40.9) and 31.5% (95% CI, 24.8-38.1), respectively. The common manifestations were gastrointestinal symptoms (87.3%; 95% CI, 82.9-91.6) and cardiovascular involvement such as myocardial dysfunction (55.3%; 95% CI, 42.4-68.2), coronary artery aneurysms (21.7%; 95% CI, 12.8-30.1) and shock (65.8%; 95% CI, 51.1-80.4), with marked elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. The majority of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (81.0%; 95% CI, 75.0-86.9), aspirin (67.3%; 95% CI, 48.8-85.7), and corticosteroids (63.6%; 95% CI, 53.4-73.8) with a variety of anti-inflammatory agents. Although myocardial dysfunction improved in 55.1% (95% CI, 33.4-76.8) at discharge, the rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was 6.3% (95% CI, 2.8-9.8) and the mortality was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.0-2.8). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that MIS-C leads to multiple organ failure, including gastrointestinal manifestations, myocardial dysfunction and coronary abnormalities, and has distinct features from Kawasaki disease.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Clinical frailty scale and mortality in COVID-19: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis: Clinical Frailty Scale in COVID-19. Introduction: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) endorsed clinical frailty scale (CFS) to help with decision-making. However, this recommendation lacks an evidence basis and is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the dose-response relationship between CFS and mortality in COVID-19 patients, with a goal of supplementing the evidence of its use. Method(s): We performed a systematic literature search from several electronic databases up until 8 September 2020. We searched for studies investigating COVID-19 patients and reported both (1) CFS and its distribution (2) CFS and its association with mortality. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated death or non-survivor. The odds ratio (ORs) will be reported per 1% increase in CFS. The potential for a non-linear relationship based on ORs of each quantitative CFS was examined using restricted cubic splines with a three-knots model. Result(s): There were a total of 3817 patients from seven studies. Mean age was 80.3 (SD 8.2), and 53% (48-58%) were males. The pooled prevalence for CFS 1-3 was 34% (32-36%), CFS 4-6 was 42% (40-45%), and CFS 7-9 was 23% (21-25%). Each 1-point increase in CFS was associated with 12% increase in mortality (OR 1.12 (1.04, 1.20), p = 0.003; I2: 77.3%). The dose-response relationship was linear (Pnon-linearity=0.116). The funnel-plot analysis was asymmetrical; Trim-and-fill analysis by the imputation of two studies on the left side resulted in OR of 1.10 [1.03, 1.19]. Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis showed that increase in CFS was associated with increase in mortality in a linear fashion.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	COVID-19 in 823 Transplant patients: A Systematic Scoping Review. Abstract Background: Management of COVID-19 in transplant patients is a big challenge. Data on immunosuppression management, clinical picture, and outcomes are lacking. <h4>Objectives:</h4> To summarize the current literature on COVID-19 in transplant patients especially the data regarding the immunosuppression protocols, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Search strategy: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LitCovid, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of the relevant studies were also searched. The search was last updated on June 3, 2020. Selection Criteria: Primary reports of solid organ transplant patients who developed COVID-19. An overlap of cases in different reports was checked. Data collection and analysis: A descriptive summary of immunosuppression therapy (before and after COVID-19), clinical presentation (symptoms, imaging, laboratory, and disease severity), management (oxygen therapy, antiviral, and antibacterial), major outcomes (Intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury), and mortality. Main results: We identified 74 studies reporting 823 cases of solid organ transplantation with COVID-19. Among 372 patients, 114 (30.6%) were mild COVID-19, 101 (27.2%) moderate, and 157 (42.2%) severe or critical. Major outcomes included intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and acute kidney injury, which occurred in 121 (14.7%), 97 (11.8%), and 63 (7.7%) of patients, respectively. Mortality was reported in 160 (19.4%) patients. Missing individual data hindered making clinical correlations. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> COVID-19 in solid organ transplant patients probably has a more disease severity, worse major outcomes (Intensive care admission, invasive ventilation, acute kidney injury), and higher mortality than in non-transplant patients.	false

0	Gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients: a rapid systematic review on 27,687 cases. Objective: This is a rapid systematic review concerning taste alterations in 27,687 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, published in the worldwide literature. Material and methods: Of the 485 articles recovered, 67 eligible studies (27,687 confirmed COVID-19 cases) were included in this analysis. We analysed the prevalence of the taste alterations in patients considering the country of origin of the studies. Results: The results show strong important differences in the overall reported prevalence of taste alterations among the different countries (from 11% of Korea to 88.8% of Belgium). Conclusions: These data highlight that there is a different geographical distribution of taste alterations in COVID-19 patients. Gustatory dysfunction seems to be an understudied symptom of COVID-19 and this may explain the inconsistencies of diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 case definition. Furthermore, this diagnostic underestimation can lead to an increased risk of contagion for the whole population and for the working classes most at risk, including the dental one.	false
0	Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. Method(s): A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. Result(s): A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50). Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	COVID 19 Vaccine Hesitancy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. <h4>Background: </h4> The unprecedented development of COVID 19 vaccine within a few months and its introduction into the population brought a sigh of relief with the promise of preventing primary infections, halting spread, reducing hospitalization of infected people, and ultimately inducing herd immunity. However, public perception in many communities leaves a lot to worry about as the so much sort-after vaccine has been met with safety concerns, scepticism and hesitancy. We seek to produce a protocol for a reliable and accurate systematic review and meta-analysis on the hesitancy of COVID 19 vaccine uptake in the mist of a global pandemic.MethodsWe developed a search strategy using MeSH terms, text words and entry terms. Nine databases will be searched: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AJOL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Research gate and Scopus. Only observational studies retrievable in the English Language will be included. The primary measurable outcome is the prevalence of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy globally. The secondary outcomes are factors that influence COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy including race, age, gender, occupation, socioeconomic class, level of education, geographic location, misinformation, social media influence and vaccine safety. Identified studies will be screened, deduplicated, selected and data items extracted using DistillerSR software. All studies will be assessed for methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Assessment of risk of bias in the selected studies will be performed using the NIH Quality assessment tool for observational studies and the Cochrane tool of risk of bias. Publication bias will be assessed using the funnel plot as well as Egger’s regression intercept. The pooled prevalence, standard error and 95% CI will be reported. The strength of evidence from this analysis will be assessed by using NIH Quality Assessment for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis.DiscussionThe outcome of this analysis will give insight into the level of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates across geographical regions globally. It will examine if herd immunity via vaccination is attainable at the pooled rate of hesitancy. This will help Governments to redesign their public messages and sensitization.

0	Comparison of Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swab Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Detection of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear., Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19., Data Sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020., Study Selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias., Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings., Results: The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses., Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.	false
0	"A complementary critical appraisal on systematic reviews regarding the most efficient therapeutic strategies for current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. BACKGROUND: This critical appraisal aims to clarify which systematic reviews on COVID-19 treatment are based on high-value evidence. Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested., METHODS: The Mesh term of ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" [Supplementary Concept] and ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18th , 2020.Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analysis. Cochrane database was searched on November 1st , 2020 by ""COVID"". With adding up 4 articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines., RESULTS: increasing number of clinical trials from onset of COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials., CONCLUSIONS: currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.

0	Summary of the Detection Kits for SARS-CoV-2 Approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China and Their Application for Diagnosis of COVID-19. The on-going global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been underway for about 11 months. Through November 20, 2020, 51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.	false
0	Representative Estimates of COVID-19 Infection Fatality Rates from Three Locations in India. There are very few estimates of the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 in low- and middle-income countries. India reports the second highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the world. We estimate age-specific IFR using data from seroprevalence surveys in Mumbai (population 12 million) and Karnataka (population 61 million), and a random sample of economically distressed migrants in Bihar with mortality followup. Among men aged 50–89, IFR is 0.12% in Karnataka (95% C.I. 0.09%–0.15%), 0.53% in Mumbai (0.52%–0.54%), and 5.64% among migrants in Bihar (0–11.16%). IFR in India is approximately twice as high for men as for women, is heterogeneous across contexts, and rises much less at older ages than in comparable studies from high income countries.	false

0	The New World 2020: A Crucial Paradigm for Meeting Fast Changing World Demands in Pakistan after COVID-19 Outbreak. The waves of COVID-19 has shaken the world and bring about many changes in society. The changed environment or new world 2020 after COVID-19 pandemic demand high quality protection in all arena of life. The most important arena that require significant changes have been divided into four categories. First of all, the high mental health issues and low mental health services in Pakistan are not sufficient to control the mental health problem ratio. There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems. Fourthly the provision of mental health support for children is a key area that needs considerable attention after pandemic or crises. The study has contemporary significance as disasters, crises and communicable disease has been prevalent throughout human history and may attack the world at any time in the future.	false
0	Plasma exchange for COVID-19 thrombo-inflammatory disease. Severe COVID-19 disease is a hyperinflammatory, pro-thrombotic state. We undertook plasma exchange (PEX) to determine its effects on organ function and thrombo-inflammatory markers. Seven critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 200 mm Hg) requiring invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support and elevated thrombo-inflammatory markers (LDH >800 IU/L and D-dimer >1000 mug/L (or doubling from baseline) received PEX, daily, for a minimum of 5 days. No other immunomodulatory medications were initiated during this period. Seven patients matched for age and baseline biochemistry were a comparator group. Coagulation screening revealed no evidence of coagulopathy. However, von Willebrand Factor (VWF) activity, antigen and VWF antigen: ADAMTS13 ratio, Factor VIII and D-dimers were all elevated. Following 5 days of PEX, plasma levels of all the above, and ferritin levels, were significantly reduced (P < .05) while lymphocyte counts normalized (P < .05). The PaO2:FiO2 ratio increased from a median interquartile range (IQR) of 11.6 (10.8-19.7) kPa to 18.1 (16.0-25.9) kPa (P < .05). Similar improvements were not observed in controls. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred among five patients in the control arm but not in patients receiving PEX. PEX improved oxygenation, decreased the incidence of AKI, normalized lymphocyte counts and reduced circulating thrombo-inflammatory markers including D-Dimer and VWF Ag:ADAMTS13 ratio.

0	Respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations in children admitted with COVID 19 in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil. <h4>Introduction</h4> COVID 19 is still a challenge in pediatrics due to variety of symptoms and different presentations <h4>Aim</h4> To describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in hospitals. <h4>Methods</h4> A retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS) <h4>Results</h4> Sixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the non-PRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until 7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%) (p= 0.2) <h4>Conclusion</h4> Non-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed. Comorbidity was found in both groups and his presence was not associated with a longer length of stay.	false
0	A Recombinant Protein SARS-CoV-2 Candidate Vaccine Elicits High-titer Neutralizing Antibodies in Macaques. <h4>Background: </h4> Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. <h4>Methods: </h4> We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques ( M. fascicularis ) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. <h4>Result: </h4> s A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the N-terminal domain alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the extended receptor binding domain but not the N-terminal domain had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> These data support the utility of spike subunit-based antigens as a vaccine for use in humans.	false
0	Immunogenicity of an AAV-based, room-temperature stable, single dose COVID-19 vaccine in mice and non-human primates. <h4>Summary</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected more than 70 million people worldwide and resulted in over 1.5 million deaths. A broad deployment of effective immunization campaigns to achieve population immunity at global scale will depend on the biological and logistical attributes of the vaccine. Here, two adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based vaccine candidates demonstrate potent immunogenicity in mouse and nonhuman primates following a single injection. Peak neutralizing antibody titers remain sustained at 5 months and are complemented by functional memory T-cells responses. The AAVrh32.33 capsid of the AAVCOVID vaccine is an engineered AAV to which no relevant pre-existing immunity exists in humans. Moreover, the vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one month and is produced at high yields using established commercial manufacturing processes in the gene therapy industry. Thus, this methodology holds as a very promising single dose, thermostable vaccine platform well-suited to address emerging pathogens on a global scale.	false
0	Optimization of the Active Neutralization of Polypropylene Film Using Response Surface Methodology. In roll-to-roll manufacturing of products, such as thin films, fibers, textiles, or membranes, the generation and accumulation of electric charges by the triboelectric effect represents a major source of electrostatic hazards. The best solution to this problem is to eliminate these charges. The aim of this article is to pave the way to the use of a triode-type corona electrode system at an industrial frequency (50 Hz) for active neutralization of electrically charged insulating films. The experimental study was carried out on dc corona charged polypropylene films that were neutralized by a sinusoidal corona discharge. The neutralization efficiency was evaluated by noncontact measurement of the electric potential at the surface of charged and neutralized polypropylene film samples. The response surface methodology was used for quantifying the effects of the various influential factors (i.e., voltage amplitude, duration of exposure to the discharge, and relative position of the neutralizer with respect to the sample) and optimizing the neutralization process.	false
0	Risk factors for COVID-19 and rheumatic disease flare in a US cohort of Latino patients. OBJECTIVES: Latino patients are overrepresented among cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are at an increased risk for severe disease. Prevalence of COVID-19 in Latinos with rheumatic diseases are poorly reported. The purpose of this study was to characterize COVID-19 clinical features and outcomes in Latino patients with rheumatic diseases., METHODS: This is a retrospective study of Latino patients with rheumatic diseases from an existing observational cohort in the Washington, DC area. Patients seen between April 1 to October 15, 2020 were analyzed in this study. We reviewed demographics, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and immunomodulatory therapies. An exploratory Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis along with logistic regression (LR) analyses were performed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 and rheumatic disease flare., RESULTS: Out of 178 patients, 32 (18%) were identified with COVID-19 and the incidence rate of infection was found to be three-fold higher than the general Latino population. No patients required ICU level care. CART analysis and multivariable LR analysis identified BMI>30.35 as a risk factor for COVID-19 [P=0.004, OR=3.37, 95%CI (1.5-7.7)]. COVID-19 positivity was a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare [P=0.02, OR=4.57, 95%CI (1.2-17.4)]., CONCLUSION: Latino patients with rheumatic diseases had a higher rate of COVID-19 compared with the general Latino population. Obesity was identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 and COVID-19 itself was found to be a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare. Latino patients with risk factors should be followed closely, especially post-COVID-19 in anticipation of disease flare. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Affiliation and essence of SARS CoV2 (COVID-19) on blood parameters of infected patients: A retrospective study. Background: Till date, SARS CoV2 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral infection in the world with the main and strong impact on respiratory airway, but this virus can affect any system of the human body., Aims: This research is aimed to dictating the effect of SARS CoV2 infections on hematological, biochemical, and arterial blood gas parameters by using their mean values., Settings and Design: This retrospective study was included a total no. of 97 SARS CoV2 positive patients from 27 March to 15 May 2020. All positive patients were consented and took all the significant details., Materials and Methods: We review the total 97 COVID-19 positive patients after obtaining all the hematological and other relevant clinical data from laboratory and medical records. The subjects were tabulated into three categories named; admitted (Gp A), discharged (Gp B), and expired (Gp C) patients and compared their hematological, biochemical parameters, and arterial blood gas analysis by using blood or serum and processed by proper methods., Statistical Analysis: The data was cleaned, edited, checked for completeness, and processed then entered in SPSS version 20 statistical software., Results: Blood samples were collected of all positive patients. Most of the patients had X-ray changes. Blood parameters showed that patients who were expired (Gp-C) suffered from anemia, lymphopenia, leucoytosis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia with high ALT, pCO2 and low pO2 than admitted and expelled patients., Conclusions: Result from this study provides that WBC count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and pO2 were independently associated and an important forecaster of mortality from SARS CoV2. All healthcare provides to regularly monitor above parameters indicators of COVID-19 infected patients to improve their quality of life and to reduce the risk of mortality rate.	false
0	AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Background Early reports indicate that AKI is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States is not well described. Methods This retrospective, observational study involved a review of data from electronic health records of patients aged $18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27 to May 30, 2020. We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality. Results Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, men, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3). Of survivors with AKI who were discharged, 35% had not recovered to baseline kidney function by the time of discharge. An additional 28 of 77 (36%) patients who had not recovered kidney function at discharge did so on posthospital follow-up. Conclusions AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with high mortality. Of all patients with AKI, only 30% survived with recovery of kidney function by the time of discharge.Copyright © 2021 by the American Society of Nephrology.	false
0	Neutralization of N501Y mutant SARS-CoV-2 by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera. Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have arisen in the United Kingdom and South Africa share the spike N501Y substitution, which is of particular concern because it is located in the viral receptor binding site for cell entry and increases binding to the receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). We generated isogenic N501 and Y501 SARS-CoV-2. Sera of 20 participants in a previously reported trial of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 had equivalent neutralizing titers to the N501 and Y501 viruses.	false
0	Effects of Bariatric Surgery on COVID-19: a Multicentric Study from a High Incidence Area. INTRODUCTION: The favorable effects of bariatric surgery (BS) on overall pulmonary function and obesity-related comorbidities could influence SARS-CoV-2 clinical expression. This has been investigated comparing COVID-19 incidence and clinical course between a cohort of patients submitted to BS and a cohort of candidates for BS during the spring outbreak in Italy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April to August 2020, 594 patients from 6 major bariatric centers in Emilia-Romagna were administered an 87-item telephonic questionnaire. Demographics, COVID-19 incidence, suggestive symptoms, and clinical outcome parameters of operated patients and candidates to BS were compared. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed including the clinical definition of probable case, according to World Health Organization criteria., RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-three operated patients (Op) and 169 candidates for BS (C) were finally included in the statistical analysis. While COVID-19 incidence confirmed by laboratory tests was similar in the two groups (5.7% vs 5.9%), lower incidence of most of COVID-19-related symptoms, such as anosmia (p: 0.046), dysgeusia (p: 0.049), fever with rapid onset (p: 0.046) were recorded among Op patients, resulting in a lower rate of probable cases (14.4% vs 23.7%; p: 0.009). Hospitalization was more frequent in C patients (2.4% vs 0.3%, p: 0.02). One death in each group was reported (0.3% vs 0.6%). Previous pneumonia and malignancies resulted to be associated with symptomatic COVID-19 at univariate and multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Patients submitted to BS seem to develop less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than subjects suffering from obesity.	false
0	Remdesivir-Ivermectin combination displays synergistic interaction with improved in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. A key element to the prevention and management of the COVID-19 pandemic is the development of effective therapeutics. Drug combination strategies of repurposed drugs offer a number of advantages to monotherapies including the potential to achieve greater efficacy, the potential to increase the therapeutic index of drugs and the potential to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Combination of agents with antiviral mechanisms of action with immune-modulatory or anti-inflammatory drug is also worthy of investigation. Here, we report on the in vitro synergistic interaction between two FDA approved drugs, remdesivir (RDV) and ivermectin (IVM) resulting in enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigations into the clinical potential of this combination, together with studies to define the underlying mechanism.	false
0	Immunogenicity and crossreactivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> COVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha-rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.	false
0	ARIA-EAACI statement on severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines -- an EAACI-ARIA Position Paper. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine BNT162b2 received approval and within the first few days of public vaccination several severe anaphylaxis cases occurred. An investigation is taking place to understand the cases and their triggers. The vaccine will be administered to a large number of individuals worldwide and concerns raised for severe adverse events might occur. With the current information, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) states its position for the following preliminary recommendations that are to be revised as soon as more data emerges. To minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions in vaccinated individuals, it is urgently required to understand the specific nature of the reported severe allergic reactions, including the background medical history of the individuals affected and the mechanisms involved. To achieve this goal all clinical and laboratory information should be collected and reported. Mild and moderate allergic patients should not be excluded from the vaccine as the exclusion of all these patients from vaccination may have a significant impact on reaching the goal of population immunity. Health care practitioners vaccinating against COVID-19 are required to be sufficiently prepared to recognise and treat anaphylaxis properly with the ability to administer adrenaline. A mandatory observation period after vaccine administration of at least 15 minutes for all individuals should be followed. The current guidelines, which exclude patients with severe allergies from vaccination with BNT162b2, should be re-evaluated after more information and experience with the new vaccine develops.	false
0	Genomic Evidence of a Sars-Cov-2 Reinfection Case With E484K Spike Mutation in Brazil. To date, uncertainty remains about how long the protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 persists and the first reports of suspected reinfection began to be described in recovered patients months after the first episode. Viral evolution may favor reinfections, and the recently described spike mutations, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the UK, South Africa, and most recently in Brazil, have raised concern on their potential impact in infectivity and immune escape. We report the first case of reinfection from genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineage presenting the E484K spike mutation in Brazil, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies.	false
0	Findings from Cardiovascular Evaluation of NCAA Division I Collegiate Student-Athletes after Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection. <h4>Objectives: </h4> The risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Methods:</h4> This is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated. <h4>Results:</h4> 55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.	false
0	HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation. <h4>Methods</h4> We analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240). <h4>Results</h4> We identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis. <h4>Conclusions</h4> HLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.	false
0	"Identification and characterization of a silent mutation in RNA binding domain of N protein coding gene from SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the occurrence of a silent mutation in the RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N protein) coding gene from SARS-CoV-2 that may consequence to a missense mutation by onset of another single nucleotide mutation., RESULTS: In the DNA sequence isolated from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Iran, a coding sequence for the RNA binding domain of N protein was detected. The comparison of Chinese and Iranian DNA sequences displayed that a thymine (T) was mutated to cytosine (C), so ""TTG"" from China was changed to ""CTG"" in Iran. Both DNA sequences from Iran and China have been encoded for leucine. In addition, the second T in ""CTG"" in the DNA or uracil (U) in ""CUG"" in the RNA sequences from Iran can be mutated to another C by a missense mutation resulting from thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) of human and base excision repair mechanism to produce ""CCG"" encoding for proline, which consequently may increase the affinity of the RNA binding domain of N protein to viral RNA and improve the transcription rate, pathogenicity, evasion from human immunity system, spreading in the human body, and risk of human-to-human transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2."	false
0	Design of a companion bioinformatic tool to detect the emergence and geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein genetic variants. BACKGROUND: Tracking the genetic variability of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a crucial challenge. Mainly to identify target sequences in order to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, but also to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution and to mine for variants associated with reduced or increased disease severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses have been released, but the main interest lies in the Spike protein, which is the pivotal element of current vaccine design, and in the Receptor Binding Domain, that accounts for most of the neutralizing the antibody activity., METHODS: Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol, and a web portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Furthermore, we provide immunogenomic analyses to understand the impact of the most frequent RBD variations., RESULTS: Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (October 2020) reveals an emerging mutation, S477N, located on the central part of the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain, the Receptor Binding Motif. Immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility, T-cell recognition, and B-cell epitope probability for most frequent human HLAs., CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a framework able to track down SARS-CoV-2 genomic variability.	false
0	Treatment of Rare Inflammatory Kidney Diseases: Drugs Targeting the Terminal Complement Pathway. The complement system comprises the frontline of the innate immune system. Triggered by pathogenic surface patterns in different pathways, the cascade concludes with the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC; complement components C5b to C9) and C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin that elicits various inflammatory signals through binding to C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). Despite its important role in pathogen elimination, priming and recruitment of myeloid cells from the immune system, as well as crosstalk with other physiological systems, inadvertent activation of the complement system can result in self-attack and overreaction in autoinflammatory diseases. Consequently, it constitutes an interesting target for specialized therapies. The paradigm of safe and efficacious terminal complement pathway inhibition has been demonstrated by the approval of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. In addition, complement contribution in rare kidney diseases, such as lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 glomerulopathy, or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis has been demonstrated. This review summarizes the involvement of the terminal effector agents of the complement system in these diseases and provides an overview of inhibitors for complement components C5, C5a, C5aR1, and MAC that are currently in clinical development. Furthermore, a link between increased complement activity and lung damage in severe COVID-19 patients is discussed and the potential for use of complement inhibitors in COVID-19 is presented.

0	Prevalence of bacterial pathogens and potential role in COVID-19 severity in patients admitted to intensive care units in Brazil. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections are associated with respiratory viral infections and invasive mechanical ventilation. In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 and impaired immune response can provide a favorable environment for microorganism growth and colonization in hospitalized individuals. Recent studies suggest that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a risk factor associated with COVID-19. In Brazil, knowledge about microbiota present in COVID-19 patients is incipient. This work describes the microbiota of 21 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units from two Brazilian centers. We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms. Other bacterial opportunistic and commensal species are also represented. Virulence factors of these pathogenic species, metabolic pathways used to evade and modulate immunological processes and the interconnection between bacterial presence and virulence in COVID-19 progression are discussed. <h4>Article Summary Line</h4> We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms in 21 Brazilian COVID-19 patients admitted to Intensive Care Units. Pathogen virulence factors and immune response evasion metabolic pathways are correlated to COVID-19 severity.	false
0	Lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enables analysis of neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent plasma. As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread around the globe, effective vaccination protocols are under deployment. Alternatively, the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy relies on the transfer of the immunoglobulin repertoire of a donor that has recovered from the disease as a means of passive vaccination. While the lack of an effective antiviral treatment inadvertently increases the interest in CP products, initial clinical evaluation on COVID-19 patients revealed that critical factors determining the outcome of CP therapy need to be defined clearly if clinical efficacy is to be expected. Measurement of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using wildtype virus presents a reliable functional assay but the availability of suitable BSL3 facilities for virus culture restricts its applicability. Instead, the use of pseudovirus particles containing elements from the SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely applied to determine the activity of CP or other neutralizing agents such as monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we present our approach to optimize GFP-encoding lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Membrane proteins for use in neutralization assays. Our results show the feasibility of pseudovirus production using a C-terminal truncated Spike protein which is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the D614G mutation. Moreover, we report that the use of Sodium Butyrate during lentiviral vector production dramatically increases pseudovirus titers. Analysis of CP neutralizing activity against particles pseudotyped with wildtype or D614G mutant Spike protein in the presence or absence the M protein revealed differential activity in CP samples that did not necessarily correlate with the amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our results indicate that the extent of neutralizing activity in CP samples depends on the quality rather than the quantity of the humoral immune responses and varies greatly between donors. Functional screening of neutralizing activity using pseudovirus-based neutralization assays must be accepted as a critical tool for choosing CP donors if clinical efficacy is to be maximized.	false
0	Association Between Low Zinc Levels and Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). BACKGROUND: We verify the prevalence of low zinc levels among critically ill patients infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the intensive care unit (ICU) who required invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as its association with severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)., METHODS: This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 ) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was <=100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 mug/dL., RESULTS: A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly. The median BMI was 30.1 (24.7-32.1) kg/m2 , with 59.9% (161 of 269) of patients having overweight and obesity. The prevalence of low zinc levels was 79.6% (214 of 269) and severe ARDS was 56.5% (152 of 269). There was an association of low zinc levels and severe ARDS (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% CI, 6.2-33.5; P < .001), even after adjusting for baseline variables (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 6.5-36.3; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with severe ARDS have a high prevalence of low serum zinc levels.

0	Looking for fever in Covid-19 nursing home residents: a false friend?. OBJECTIVES: Residents in nursing homes represent a frail population of patients, and SARS-CoV-2 infection can spread easily in this setting. Despite a frequent severe evolution of the disease, these patients often present an atypical course with mild initial symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of fever in elderly SARS-CoV-2 positive patients residing in nursing homes., METHODS: 231 elderly patients from three nursing homes of Pavia and its Province were enrolled in April-May 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed using real-time RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and/or serological assay (LIAISON R SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG). Positive patients were defined by positivity at nasopharyngeal swab and/or at serology., RESULTS: 170 patients (74%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive, 61 subjects (26%) resulted negative at both tests. Fever (T > 37,5 degreeC) was observed only in four patients (1,7%), three in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (1,7%) and one in the SARS-CoV-2-negative one (1,6%)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever was extremely low in our population of nursing home SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Thus, this finding must be taken into consideration when screening patients without fever in nursing homes. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 serologic immune response in exogenously immunosuppressed patients. BACKGROUND: While it is presumed that immunosuppressed patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppression, are at greater risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population, the antibody response to infection in this patient population has not been studied., METHODS: In this report, we follow theanti-SARS-CoV-2antibody levels in patientswith COVID-19 who areundergoing exogenous immunosuppression. Specifically, we studied the antibody response ofthree solid organ transplant recipient patients, three patients who take daily inhaled fluticasone, and a patient on etanercept and daily inhaled fluticasone, and compared them to five patients not on exogenous immunosuppression., RESULTS: We found that the solid organ transplant patients on full immunosuppression are at risk of having a delayed antibody response and poor outcome. We did not find evidence that inhaled steroids nor etanercept predisposepatientsto delayed immune response to SARS-CoV-2., CONCLUSION: The data presented here suggest that solid organ transplant recipients may be good candidates for early targeted intervention against SARS-CoV-2.

0	Glycan reactive anti-HIV-1 antibodies bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do not block viral entry. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via FcγRII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.	false
0	COVID-19 and the revival of passive immunization: Antibody therapy for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and preventing host cell infection: IUPHAR review: 31. The COVID-19 pandemic urged both scientific community and health care companies to undertake an unprecedented effort with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing effective therapeutic solutions. The peculiar immune response triggered by such virus, that seems to last only few months, induced to look for alternatives such as passive immunization in addition to conventional vaccinations. Convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies selected among the most potent neutralizing binders induced by the virus infection, recombinant human single-domain antibodies and binders of variable scaffold and different origin have been tested alone or in combination exploiting mono and multivalent/multispecific formats. In this review we analyze the state of the advancement of the research in this field and present a summary of the ongoing projects finalized to identify suitable molecules for therapies based on passive immunization.

0	Clinical characteristics and viral shedding kinetics of 38 asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A retrospective observational study. ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and viral shedding kinetics of asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The data of 38 asymptomatic patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were collected from February to March 2020 in Tuanfeng County, Huanggang, Hubei, China. The epidemiology, laboratory examination, chest imaging, viral nucleic acid test results, clinical characteristics, and viral shedding time were summarized in this retrospective study. The study included 20 family members of patients with COVID-19, 10 medical personnel participating in COVID-19 treatment or working in a fever clinic, 6 personnel from quarantine places, 1 individual with a close contact history with confirmed patients, and 1 local epidemic prevention personnel. All were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The white blood cell (WBC) count, the absolute value of lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer were normal. Pneumonia manifestations were not found in the chest computed tomography (CT) scan of 36 patients; the remaining 2 cases included a 1-year-old child and a pregnant woman, and they did not undergo chest CT. The viral shedding time was 6 days.All asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 had a history of close contact or exposure. Laboratory tests were normal. Chest imaging did not show any pneumonia manifestation. The viral shedding time was <10 days, which is shorter than that of patients with COVID-19. A timely discovery of such asymptomatic infections is crucial for blocking the spread of the virus and strengthening the prevention and control measures. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

0	Challenges in COVID-19 drug treatment in patients with advanced liver diseases: A hepatology perspective. The global incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to increase despite health care efforts. The disease is caused by coronavirus 2 with high transmission and mortality rates. Little is known about the management of COVID-19 in advanced liver disease. The aim of work was to propose a plan for management of this drastic disease in case of this specific population with review of medications that could be suitable for advanced liver disease. All the guidelines and medications available for treatment of COVID-19 were reviewed with selection of the less toxic medications that could be used in advanced liver disease. Drugs suitable to manage COVID-19 in patients with liver disease might include remdesivir intravenously, nitazoxanide + sofosbuvir, ivermectin, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and low molecular weight heparin in certain situations. Advanced liver disease is associated with portal hypertension and splenomegaly with reduction of blood elements and immune dysfunction and impaired T cell function. Thus, when confronted by cytokine storm as an immune response to COVID-19, there may be an increase in the mortality rate of these patients. Through this review, a plan to treat COVID-19 in this special group of patients with advanced cirrhosis is proposed. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

0	Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection: a prospective cohort study. <h4>Background</h4> SARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing. <h4>Methods</h4> 234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. <h4>Results</h4> The overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Self-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 sensing by RIG-I and MDA5 links epithelial infection to macrophage inflammation. <h4>Summary</h4> SARS-CoV-2 infection causes broad-spectrum immunopathological disease, exacerbated by inflammatory co-morbidities. A better understanding of mechanisms underpinning virus-associated inflammation is required to develop effective therapeutics. Here we discover that SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly in lung epithelial cells despite triggering a robust innate immune response through activation of cytoplasmic RNA-ensors RIG-I and MDA5. The inflammatory mediators produced during epithelial cell infection can stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation. Critically, this can be limited by abrogating RNA sensing, or by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 further exacerbates the local inflammatory environment when macrophages or epithelial cells are primed with exogenous inflammatory stimuli. We propose that RNA sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelium is a key driver of inflammation, the extent of which is influenced by the inflammatory state of the local environment, and that specific inhibition of innate immune pathways may beneficially mitigate inflammation-associated COVID-19. <h4>Highlights</h4> SARS-CoV-2 activates RNA sensors and consequent inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells Epithelial RNA sensing responses drive pro-inflammatory macrophage activation Exogenous inflammatory stimuli exacerbate responses to SARS-CoV-2 in both eplithelial cells and macrophages Immunomodulators inhibit RNA sensing responses and consequent macrophage inflammation <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4>	false
0	COVID-19 epidemic prediction and the impact of public health interventions: A review of COVID-19 epidemic models. The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to all corners of the word, in a very complex manner. A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9-7 days, 4.41-8.4 days, 2.3-10 days and 4.4-7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models. Copyright .	false
0	How to Survive a Pandemic: The Corporate Resiliency of Travel and Leisure Companies to the COVID-19 Outbreak. What protects travel and leisure companies from a global pandemic, such as COVID-19? To answer this question, we investigate data on over 1,200 travel and leisure companies in 52 countries. We consider 80 characteristics, such as company financial ratios, macroeconomic variables, and government policy responses. Using regressions and machine learning tools, we demonstrate that firms with low valuations, limited leverage, and high investments have been more immune to the pandemic-induced crash. We also find a beneficial effect of stringent containment and closure interventions. Finally, our results indicate that countries with less individualism may be better positioned to cope with the pandemic. Our findings have implications for regulatory bodies, managers, and investors concerning future pandemic outbreaks.	false
0	Balancing costs and benefits of pandemic control in an outbreak phase. After the first lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries faced difficulties in balancing infection control with economics. Due to limited prior knowledge, economists began researching this issue using cost-benefit analysis and found that infection control processes significantly affect economic efficiency. Rowthorn and Maciejowski [R. Rowthorn and J.A. Maciejowski, Oxford Rev. Econ. Policy 36, S38 (2020)] used economic parameters in the United Kingdom to numerically demonstrate that an optimal balance was found in the process, including keeping the infected population stationary. However, universally applicable knowledge, which is indispensable for the guiding principles of infection control, has not yet been developed because these analyses assume regional parameters and a specific disease. Here, we prove the universal result of economic irreversibility by applying the idea of thermodynamics to pandemic control. It means that delaying infection control measures is more expensive than implementing infection control measures early while keeping infected populations stationary. This implies that once the infected population increases, society cannot return to its previous state without extra expenditures. This universal result is analytically obtained by focusing on the infection-spreading phase of pandemics, which is applicable not only to COVID-19, and whether or not “herd immunity” exists. It also confirms the numerical observation of stationary infected populations in its optimally efficient process. Our findings suggest that economic irreversibility is a guiding principle for balancing infection control with economic effects.	false

We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> Left ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS- CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per µg RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection. <h4>Results</h4> A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per µg RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS- CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2 . Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term “extracellular exosomes”. <h4>Conclusion</h4> SARS-CoV-2 infection including virus replication and distinct transcriptomic alterations without signs of myocarditis demonstrate a cardiac involvement. In this autopsy series, cardiac replication of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with early death.	false
0	An Anti-Nucleocapsid Antigen Sars-Cov-2 Total Antibody Assay Finds Comparable Results in Edta-Anticoagulated Whole Blood Obtained from Capillary and Venous Blood Sampling. Although SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays have been found to provide valid results in EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood, so far, they have not demonstrated that antibody levels in whole blood originating from capillary blood samples are comparable to antibody levels measured in blood from a venous origin. Here, blood is drawn simultaneously by capillary and venous blood sampling. Antibody titers are determined by an assay employing electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) and SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulins are detected with specificity directed against the nucleocapsid antigen. Six individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and six individuals without COVID-19 are analyzed. Antibody titers in capillary venous whole blood did not show significant differences, and when corrected for hematocrit, they did not differ from the results obtained from serum. In conclusion, capillary sampled EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood seems to be an attractive alternative matrix for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when employing ECLIA for detecting total antibodies directed against nucleocapsid antibodies.

0	COVID-19 in Pediatrics: Characteristics of Hospitalized Children in New Jersey. OBJECTIVES: Understanding the risk factors, predictors, and clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with severe disease., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, to a large health network in New Jersey with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, rapid testing, or serum immunoglobulin G testing; we included demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes., RESULTS: A total of 81 patients <=21 years old were admitted with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or serum immunoglobulin testing. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were admitted for management of acute COVID-19 infection, whereas 14 (17.3%) were admitted for management of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 81 hospitalized patients, 28 (34.6%) required intensive care. A majority of patients (42 [51.9%]) admitted for both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C were Hispanic. Underlying chronic health conditions were not present in most patients. Obesity (mean BMI of 41.1) was noted in the patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, although not statistically significant. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were statistically significant in the patients with MIS-C treated in the ICU., CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing literature of potential risk factors for severe disease in pediatric patients due to COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity represented the majority of patients with both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C, despite only representing 10% to 20% of the population our hospitals serve. Infants and patients with chronic health conditions were not at increased risk for severe disease. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were associated with more severe disease. Copyright © 2021 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.	false
0	Role of the Bronchoalveolar Lavage in Noncritically Ill Patients during the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic. Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is currently not recommended in noncritically ill patients for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, the diagnosis is based on the RT-PCR test on a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and abnormal findings on the chest CT scan. However, the sensitivity of the NPS and the specificity of the chest CT scan are low. Results of BAL in case of negative NPS testing are underreported, especially in the subgroup of immunocompromised patients., Objectives: The added value of BAL in the management of unstable, but noncritically ill patients, suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection despite one previous negative NPS and the side effects of the procedure for the patients and the health-care providers, were assessed during the epidemic peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Belgium., Methods: This multicentric study included all consecutive noncritically ill patients hospitalized with a clinical and radiological suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection but with a negative NPS. BAL was performed according to a predefined decisional algorithm based on their state of immunocompetence, the chest CT scan features, and their respiratory status., Results: Among the 55 patients included in the study, 14 patients were diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, there was a relationship between the cycle threshold of the RT-PCR and the interval of time between the symptom onset and the BAL procedure (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.8, p = 0.0004). Therapeutic management was changed in 33 patients because another infectious agent was identified in 23 patients or because an alternative diagnosis was made in 10 patients. In immunocompromised patients, the impact of BAL was even more marked (change in therapy for 13/17 patients). No significant adverse event was noted for patients or health-care staff. All health-care workers remained negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPS and serology at the end of the study., Conclusions: In this real-life study, BAL can be performed safely in selected noncritically ill patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing significant clinical benefits that outweigh the risks.

0	Differences in the Clinical and Hematological Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients with and without Type 2 Diabetes. Objective: To examine whether comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the clinical and hematological parameters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients., Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 30, 2020 to March 17, 2020, at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A detailed clinical record was kept for each subject, including the medical history of COVID-19 and physical and laboratory examinations. A total of 164 subjects were eligible for the study, among which 40 patients were comorbid with T2D. Further analysis was conducted in two subcohorts of sex- and age-matched patients with and without T2D to identify hematological and biochemical differences. The laboratory tests, including routine blood tests, serum biochemistry, and coagulation function, were performed upon admission., Results: The two groups showed no significant differences in baseline parameters, including age, sex, chest X-ray, or computed tomography (CT) findings, upon admission. However, patients with T2D showed an increased incidence of diarrhea. T2D patients required more recovery time from pneumonia, as shown by follow-up CT findings, which might contribute to the prolonged hospitalization. Comorbidity with T2D also increased risk of secondary bacterial infection during COVID-19. The T2D group had significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts compared with the nondiabetic group, but T2D patients suffered from more severe lymphocytopenia and inflammation (P < 0.05). Most biochemical parameters showed no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, patients with T2D seemed to have a significantly higher risk of developing hyperlactatemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia., Conclusions: COVID-19 patients comorbid with T2D demonstrated distinguishing clinical features and hematological parameters during the infection. It is necessary to develop a different clinical severity scoring system for COVID-19 patients with T2D. This study may provide helpful clues for the assessment and management of COVID-19 in T2D patients. Copyright © 2020 Yujing Sun et al.	false

Objective: To describe the COVID-19 epidemic and its characteristics in Heilongjiang province, and provide evidence for the further prevention and control of COVID-19 in the province. Methods: The information of COVID-19 cases and clusters were collected from national notifiable disease report system and management information system for reporting public health emergencies of China CDC. The Software's of Excel 2010 and SPSS 23.0 were applied for data cleaning and statistical analysis on the population, time and area distributions of COVID-19 cases. Results: On January 22, 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Heilongjiang. By March 11, 2020, a total of 482 cases domestic case of COVID-19, The incidence rate was 1.28/100 000, the mortality rate was 2.70% (13/482) in 13 municipalities in Heilongjiang. There were 81 clusters of COVID-19, The number of confirmed cases accounted for 79.25% (382/482) of the total confirmed cases and 12 cases of deaths. The family clusters accounted for 86.42% (70/81). Compared with the sporadic cases, the mortality rate, proportion of elderly cases aged 60 or above and severe or critical cases of clinical classification were all higher in the clusters especially the family clusters, but the differences were not significant (P>0.05). There were 34 clusters involving more than 5 confirmed cases accounted for 41.98% (34/81) of the total clusters, the involved cases accounted for 68.31% (261/382) of the total cases of clusters. There were significant differences in age distribution of the cases among the case clusters with different case numbers. In the clusters involving 6-9 cases, the proportion of cases aged 65 years or above was more (26.53%, 39/147). Conclusions: The incidence rate of COVID-19 was relatively high and the early epidemic was serious in Heilongjiang, The number of cases was large in clusters especially family clusters.	false

0	"Recent discovery and development on SARS-CoV-2: A review of current literature. The origin and spread of current novel coronavirus had raised serious concerns among stakeholders around the globe. Different speculations that may unfold the mystery in the future are taking roots, but now there is no globally acceptable opinion about the origin and spread of this novel coronavirus. It is reported that Wuhan city of Hubei Province of central China was the epicenter of this outbreak of novel coronavirus. However, initial inadequate preventive measures allowed the infection to cross the borders of China and that pulls the world into drastic public health and economic crisis. This coronavirus disease now named as COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) and the responsible coronavirus is named as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). "" The spread of SARS-CoV-2 is alarming even after 5 months of inception and WHO further warns the world to be prepared for more intense spread of COVID-19. Different diagnostic tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 are being used around the globe, but the identification of asymptomatic carriers of the disease is a serious challenge in countering the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no specific treatment available, only preventive, symptomatic, and supportive treatments are being used for clinical management of COVID-19. The available knowledge is limited, therefore, any escalation of information on the disease will help to combat this global challenge of COVID-19. In this review, we have discussed and summarized the available multi-factorial information and recent updates on the SARS-CoV-2 which can help support future research and may help in the strategic management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The articles available online before June 30, 2020, on bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, Google Scholar, and PubMed have been assessed for the compilation of this review. Information on the official portal of WHO, CDC, ICMR, etc., were also assessed and used with due credit. Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care."	false
0	COVID-19 myocarditis and long-term heart failure sequelae. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The clinical syndrome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction is commonly seen in these patients, often presenting as clinical heart failure. Accordingly, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on COVID-19 myocarditis and its long-term heart failure sequelae., RECENT FINDINGS: Several suspected cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported. It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies., SUMMARY: COVID-19 can cause a spectrum of ventricular dysfunction ranging from mild disease to fulminant myocarditis with hemodynamic instability. Future research is needed to understand the true prevalence of COVID-19 myocarditis, as well as to better define various diagnostic protocols and treatment strategies.

0	Biological Significance of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Lessons Learned From Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of cellular and humoral immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and pertinent observations made in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)., METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response., CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines.

0	Clinical Diagnosis of COVID-19: a Prompt, Feasible, Costless, and Highly Sensitive Diagnostic Tool for COVID-19 Based on a 1,757-Patient Cohort (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis). Importance: A major barrier for successful therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 is the inability during the viral replication stage, when drugs with potential antiviral activity could demonstrate efficacy and preclude progression to more severe stages. Reasons that hamper an earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 include the unspecific and mild symptoms during the first stage, the delay in the diagnosis and specific management caused by the requirement of a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and the insufficient sensitivity of the a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, oppositely to what is recommended for a screening test during an outbreak. More sensitive and earlier diagnostic tools for COVID-19 should be unraveled as a key strategy for an breakthrough change in the disease course and response to specific therapies, particularly those that target the blockage of viral shedding. We aimed to create an accurate, sensitive, easy-to-perform and intuitive clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 without the need of a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (termed as The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis), resulted from a 1,757 population cohort, eo eventually encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of presenting COVID-19, independent of a rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 test, to avoid delays and loss of appropriate timing for potential therapies. Materials and methods: This is a post-hoc analysis of clinical data prospectively collected of the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials, that resulted in scorings for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, based on the likelihood of presenting actual COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and known positive household contact. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different periods and both periods together, for females, males and both, in a total of nine different scenarios, according to combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms, one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with known positive household contacts. Scorings that yielded the highest pre-test probability, sensitivity and accuracy were selected. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Of the 1,757 patients screened, 1,284 were diagnosed for COVID-19. The scoring that required: 1. Two or more symptoms, or anosmia or ageusia alone, for subjects without known contact; or 2. One or more symptoms, including anosmia or ageusia alone, when with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%) among all combinations attempted, and higher sensitivity (85.7%) than rtPCRSARS-CoV-2 commercially available kit tests. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis demonstrated to be a feasible, easy, costless, and sensitive diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Because clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 avoids delays in specific treatments, particularly for high-risk populations, prevents false-negative diagnosis, and reduces diagnostic costs, this diagnostic tool should be considered as an option for COVID-19 diagnosis, at least while SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus and vaccination rate is below the required for herd immunity.	false
0	Multifaceted highly targeted sequential multidrug treatment of early ambulatory high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading across the world has led to surges of COVID-19 illness, hospitalizations, and death. The complex and multifaceted pathophysiology of life-threatening COVID-19 illness including viral mediated organ damage, cytokine storm, and thrombosis warrants early interventions to address all components of the devastating illness. In countries where therapeutic nihilism is prevalent, patients endure escalating symptoms and without early treatment can succumb to delayed in-hospital care and death. Prompt early initiation of sequenced multidrug therapy (SMDT) is a widely and currently available solution to stem the tide of hospitalizations and death. A multipronged therapeutic approach includes 1) adjuvant nutraceuticals, 2) combination intracellular anti-infective therapy, 3) inhaled/oral corticosteroids, 4) antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, 5) supportive care including supplemental oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Randomized trials of individual, novel oral therapies have not delivered tools for physicians to combat the pandemic in practice. No single therapeutic option thus far has been entirely effective and therefore a combination is required at this time. An urgent immediate pivot from single drug to SMDT regimens should be employed as a critical strategy to deal with the large numbers of acute COVID-19 patients with the aim of reducing the intensity and duration of symptoms and avoiding hospitalization and death.

0	Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent blood using a coronavirus antigen microarray. The current practice for diagnosis of COVID-19, based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk, likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection. Serologic methods can more accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.	false
0	Tocilizumab in the Management of COVID-19: A Preliminary Report. IMPORTANCE: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death due to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab., EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed., RESULTS: The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the true effect of Tocilizumab in this condition. Copyright © 2020 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

0	Relationship between serum osteopontin levels and the severity of COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute inflammatory respiratory disease. Osteopontin (OPN) is a glycoprotein expressed in various cell types, such as bone, immune, smooth muscle, epithelial and endothelial cells. It also acts as a regulator of immune response. The aim of the present study was to reveal the place of serum osteopontin levels in predicting severity among patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This study included 84 patients, 43 female and 45 male. Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 non-severe group (n: 48), group 2 severe (n: 40). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, white blood cell counts, albumin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and OPN levels were recorded. The OPN levels and these inflammatory parameters of the two groups were compared., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in terms of gender (female/male 25/23 vs. 18/22) and platelet count (178K/muL vs. 191K/muL) between the groups (p> 0.05). Ages (57.7+/- 17.0 years vs. 71.4+/- 12.8 years), procalcitonin (0.07 vs. 0.24ng/mL), CRP (17 vs 158mg/l), neutrophil count (3.7 vs 5.64K/muL), WBC counts (5.38 vs 7.85K/muL) and number of deaths (0 vs 26) (p< 0.001). The OPN levels (98.5 vs 13.75ng/mL, p= 0.002) were found to be statistically higher, in group 2 than group 1., CONCLUSION: The present study showed that OPN can be used to predict the severity in patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Autoimmune anti-DNA antibodies predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 can lead to severe disease and death, however the mechanisms of pathogenesis in these patients remain poorly understood. High levels of autoimmune antibodies have been observed frequently in COVID-19 patients but their specific contribution to disease severity and clinical manifestations remain unknown. We performed a retrospective study of 115 COVID-19 hospitalized patients with different degrees of severity to analyze the generation of autoimmune antibodies to common antigens: a lysate of erythrocytes, the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and DNA. High levels of IgG autoantibodies against erythrocyte lysates were observed in a large percentage (up to 41%) of patients. Anti-DNA antibodies determined upon hospital admission correlated strongly with later development of severe disease, showing a positive predictive value of 89.5% and accounting for 22% of total severe cases. Statistical analysis identified strong correlations between anti-DNA antibodies and markers of cell injury, coagulation, neutrophil levels and erythrocyte size. Anti-DNA autoantibodies may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and could be developed as a predictive biomarker for disease severity and specific clinical manifestations.	false
0	[Epidemiology and public health in the COVID-19 epidemic]. In the last year, all have suffered the devastating consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Over the course of a few months, the news media has bombarded us with messages about incidences, lethality, or even more technical measurements such as R0 or the attack rate. With this update, we hope to clarify basic concepts on the dynamic of the epidemic as well as present what is known about it as of the time of writing. To do so, the information available from international bodies such as the World Health Organization as well as the Ministry of Health has been extracted and used. In no case is it to be understood as a fixed or known situation; it is a situation that, in contrast, is invariably changeable. Copyright .	false
0	[Strategy for planning and execution of a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study on teaching hospital workers during a pandemic situation]. OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning and execution process of a massive seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV-2 in professionals of the Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon (HUFA) (Spain)., METHODS: A description is presented of the plan designed and developed at the HUFA for the execution of the extraction of the samples for serology from all the professionals who worked in the hospital between 14 and 29 April 2020. A descriptive analysis of the participation of the professionals in the study is carried out. Extraction areas, health personnel, and execution times were planned. A total of 2326 extractions were assigned to health personnel, the remaining extractions were assigned to workers from external companies., RESULTS: A total of 2641 workers (90.5%) out of 2918 candidates participated in the study. The professional category most analysed was nursing with 28.3% (n = 590). The percentage of compliance with schedule planning was 28.6%. Up to a maximum of 298 daily extractions were planned. The busiest day was the 4th day of the study with 399 extractions., CONCLUSIONS: The organising of such a large study, with a 100% coverage of those who worked in the hospital, and with such a great response from the workers involved, has led to obtaining results of high reliability in the seroprevalence study carried out. Although the percentage of participation was very high, the level of compliance with the planning was low. Copyright © 2020 FECA. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.	false
0	Chest X-ray in the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic descending phase in Italy: correlation with patients' outcome. PURPOSE: The aims of our study are: (1) to estimate admission chest X-ray (CXR) accuracy during the descending phase of pandemic; (2) to identify specific CXR findings strictly associated with COVID-19 infection; and (3) to correlate lung involvement of admission CXR with patients' outcome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the admission CXR of 327 patients accessed to our institute during the Italian pandemic descending phase (April 2020). For each CXR were searched ground glass opacification (GGO), consolidation (CO), reticular-nodular opacities (RNO), nodules, excavations, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, vascular congestion and cardiac enlargement. For lung alterations was defined the predominance (upper or basal, focal or diffuse, central or peripheric, etc.). Then radiologists assessed whether CXRs were suggestive or not for COVID-19 infection. For COVID-19 patients, a prognostic score was applied and correlated with the patients' outcome., RESULTS: CXR showed 83% of specificity and 60% of sensitivity. GGO, CO, RNO and a peripheric, diffuse and basal prevalence showed good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis pointed out GGO and a basal or diffuse distribution as independent predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis. The prognostic score showed good correlation with the patients' outcome., CONCLUSION: In our study, admission CXR showed a fair specificity and a good correlation with patients' outcome. GGO and others CXR findings showed a good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis; besides GGO a diffuse or bibasal distribution resulted in independent variables highly suggestive for COVID-19 infection thus enabling radiologists to signal to clinicians radiologically suspect patients during the pandemic descending phase.	false
0	Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Future Birth Rate. Here, we examine the potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future birth rates. This highly contagious disease originated in China, and rapidly spread worldwide, leading to extensive lockdown policies being implemented globally with the aim of containing the infection rates and its serious attendant consequences. Based on previous extant literature, this paper overviews the potential demographic consequences of the current progressively widespread epidemic on conception and fertility as driven by the data obtained during similar prior incidents. In general, epidemics manifest a common pattern as far as their impact on population, which is remarkably similar to natural disasters, i.e., a steep decline in birth rates followed by gradual increases and then followed by a baby boom. Additionally, we have also depicted how economic conditions, mental health, fear, and mortality may also influence future birth rates.

En este texto el caso brasileño será detallado más a fundo a titulo de ejemplo. El estudio de caso en algunos sitios electrónicos brasileños fue hecho en marzo a junio de 2020.<br><br><b>English Abstract:</b> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic technology firms and governmental bodies are in discussion about the creation and organisation of many forms of data collection including georeferenced and health data to monitor lockdowns, quarantines, isolation policies and social distancing. Health, location, shopping behaviour, money transfers, facial biometrics, digital certificates etc. can be used and serve as a powerful weapon for fighting the virus. However, an urgent crisis of digital rights will emerge if the data collected and parameterized is not maintained in an open manner, respecting both data regulation about privacy and protection of the personal and sensitive information, as well as reassuring trustworthiness (fairness, lawfulness and transparency), of the algorithmic suggestions that are producing analysis and an array of decisions. States are increasingly assisted by private companies by using their collected telephone data, CCTV images, temperature control points, airline and rail reservations, credit card information, online shopping records, social networking data, facial recognition and in some cases, drone data. In this context transparency and openness of data is essential. We case studied Brazil in order to illustrate the ideas of this paper, the analyses were made over several Brazilian websites during March and June of 2020.	false
0	Clinical management of patients with primary immunodeficiencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: Patients affected by Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) represent a potential group-at-risk in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Studies on large and small cohorts of IEI reported a huge variability clinical manifestations associated to SARS-Cov-2, ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate/severe to death. A great impulse to improve remote assistance programs and to switch to home-based treatment to reduce mobility and face to face contacts has been implemented. Areas covered: The authors completed a comprehensive review of the literature by searching the PubMed database for studies on large and small cohorts and case reports of IEI patients with COVID-19, with the aim to provide useful information for their clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expert opinion: Surprisingly, a low number of IEI patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 were reported with a risk to die for COVID-19 overlapping that of the general population. The low number might be explained by the choice of most physicians to inform early in the pandemic about safety measures, to switch most of the IEI patients to home therapy and to remote assistance. The guidelines issued by the scientific societies and periodically updated, represent the best tool for the clinical management of IEI patients.	false
0	Men and women affected by Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia: same CT features but different outcome. AIM: To compare the computed tomography (CT) features of Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia between the two sexes and among different age groups., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=331) who presented to the emergency department and underwent chest CT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a time interval <7 days, which were subsequently found to be consistent with Sars-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled retrospectively. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the images in consensus, recording the number of pulmonary lobes with ground-glass opacities and with consolidation. A CT score was subsequently calculated based on the percentage involvement of each lobe. Clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and level of required hospitalisation were noted. In-hospital mortality was recorded and analysed via the Kaplan-Meier estimator., RESULTS: Males and females had the same age distribution. No statistically significant difference was found in the analysed CT features and in the CT score (p=0.31) between the sexes. More females were affected by two or more comorbidities (17.1% versus 7.5%, p=0.024), all comorbidities except diabetes were more prevalent in females. Women had a higher probability to be discharged home and a lower probability to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; p=0.008), in-hospital mortality was inferior (13.5% versus 22%)., CONCLUSION: Despite more comorbidities, women had lower hospital admission and mortality, which was independent of CT findings between both sexes.

0	Hospital-based group medical quarantine increased the pre- dialysis blood pressure in maintenance hemodialysis patients. BACKGROUND: Quarantine is an effective measure to contain the spread of infectious disease, however, it can be a great challenge for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hospital-based group medical quarantine (H-GMQ) on blood pressure (BP) in MHD patients, and the effect of age on change in BP., METHODS: MHD patients in our dialysis center who were under H-GMQ due to exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from 3 months before H-GMQ to the end of H-GMQ. They were divided into two groups by median age (61 y). BP and related data before and during H-GMQ between groups were analyzed. The association between age and change in BP was estimated using multivariable linear regression analysis., RESULTS: One hundred and thirty MHD patients were enrolled. The pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during H-GMQ were significantly higher than before, the serum sodium decreased significantly at the end of H-GMQ. After adjusting for covariates by multivariable regression, age had a negative correlation with BP elevation (R2 =0.218, P=0.246). Subgroup analysis showed that both pre-dialysis SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) increased significantly during H-GMQ in patients less than 61 years old, instead, neither SBP nor DBP changed in the elderly., CONCLUSIONS: H-GMQ increased the pre-dialysis BP in MHD patients, especially in younger patients. More attention should be paid to these patients' BP if another quarantine is needed.	false

0	Serology in COVID-19 – Comparison of Two Methods. The aim of our study was to investigate the difference in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment with two various assays. 127 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two serological tests were used: SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA on the Alinity system (ABBOTT) and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA (DiaSorin). Both assays exhibited 96.85% (123/127 patients) overall compatibility. In 2 cases the positive results in N-based test, were negative in S-based test, and in 2 cases negative results in S-based test were positive in N-based test. Based on the results of our study we concluded that the assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against N and S protein in population medicine shows comparable usefulness of both tests.	false
0	Screening of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests using saliva for pregnant women and their partners in Himeji city. A screening of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests using saliva for pregnant women and their partners was performed at all 12 maternity facilities located in Himeji city between May 29 and September 5, 2020. Pregnant women at 37 or more weeks of gestation or who experienced threatened labor and their partners who cared for an infant underwent a saliva PCR test with informed consent. As a result, all of 1475 pregnant women and 1343 partners tested negative for COVID-19 PCR. There were no cases of false positive or false negative PCR tests. This cohort study revealed for the first time that a screening of COVID-19 PCR tests using saliva may be useful to sustain perinatal medical care during the pandemic period in Japan.

0	Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the influence of confinement by COVID-19 in fracture patients entered in a traumatology service at a third level hospital. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the confinement of approximately one third of the world population, causing a drastic change in the activities of daily life with many repercussions at the health, economic and social levels., OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population., METHODS: Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital. On the other hand, osteoporotic hip fractures have not varied in their incidence and a decrease in the average postoperative and overall stay has been observed. Copyright © 2020 SECOT.

0	COVID-19 related health inequality exists even in a city where disease incidence is relatively low: a telephone survey in Hong Kong. BACKGROUND: We examined whether COVID-19 could exert inequalities in socioeconomic conditions and health in Hong Kong, where there has been a relatively low COVID-19 incidence., METHODS: 752 adult respondents from a previous random sample participated in a telephone survey from 20 April to 11 May 2020. We examined demographic and socioeconomic factors, worry of COVID-19, general health, economic activity, and personal protective equipment (PPE) and related hygiene practice by deprivation status. The associations between deprivation and negative COVID-19 related issues were analysed using binary logistic regressions, while the associations of these issues with health were analysed using linear regressions. Path analysis was conducted to determine the direct effect of deprivation, and the indirect effects via COVID-19 related issues, on health. Interactions between deprivation and the mediators were also tested., RESULTS: Deprived individuals were more likely to have job loss/instability, less reserves, less utilisation and more concerns of PPE. After adjustments for potential confounders, being deprived was associated with having greater risk of low reserve of face masks, being worried about the disease and job loss/instability. Being deprived had worse physical (beta=-0.154, p<0.001) and mental health (beta=-0.211, p<0.001) and had an indirect effect on mental health via worry and job loss/instability (total indirect effect: beta=-0.027, p=0.017; proportion being mediated=11.46%). In addition, significant interaction between deprivation and change of economic activity status was observed on mental health-related quality of life., CONCLUSION: Even if the COVID-19 incidence was relatively low, part of the observed health inequality can be explained by people's concerns over livelihood and economic activity, which were affected by the containment measures. We should look beyond the incidence to address COVID-19 related health inequalities. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

0	Take Home Injectable Opioids for Opioid Use Disorder During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic Is in Urgent Need: A Case Study. <h4>Background: </h4> In North America the opioid poisoning crisis currently faces the unprecedented challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, further straining people and communities already facing structural and individual vulnerabilities. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they’re financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. Case Presentation: Here we present the first case of a patient in Canada with long-term OUD that received take home injectable diacetylmorphine to self-isolate in an approved site after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive antibiotics. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> In the present case we demonstrated that it is feasible to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with no apparent negative consequences. Improving upon and making permanent these recently introduced risk mitigating guidance during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect during the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access evidence-based care in addiction treatment.	false
0	Experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection of bank voles - general susceptibility but lack of direct transmission. After experimental inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 infection was proven for bank voles by seroconversion within eight days and detection of viral RNA in nasal tissue for up to 21 days. However, transmission to contact animals was not detected. Therefore, bank voles are unlikely to establish effective SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycles in nature. <h4>Article Summary Line</h4> Bank voles show low-level viral replication and seroconversion upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, but lack transmission to contact animals.	false
0	"Incidence, delays, and outcomes of STEMI during COVID-19 outbreak: Analysis from the France PCI registry. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on incidence, delays, and outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in France., Methods: We analyzed all patients undergoing PPCI <24 hours STEMI included in the prospective France PCI registry. The 2 groups were compared on mean monthly number of patients, delays in the pathway care, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding)., Results: From January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2020, 2064 STEMI patients undergoing PPCI were included: 1942 in the prelockdown group and 122 in the lockdown group. Only 2 cases in the lockdown group were positive for COVID-19. A significant drop (12%) in mean number of STEMI/month was observed in the lockdown group compared with prelockdown (139 vs 122, P < 0.04). A significant increase in ""symptom onset to first medical contact"" delay was found for patients who presented directly to the emergency department (ED) (238 minutes vs 450 minutes; P = 0.04). There were higher rates of in-hospital MACE (7.7% vs 12.3%; P = 0.06) and mortality (4.9% vs 8.2%; P = 0.11) in the lockdown group but the differences were not significant., Conclusion: According to the multicenter France PCI registry, the COVID-19 outbreak in France was associated with a significant decline in STEMI undergoing PPCI and longer transfer time for patients who presented directly to the ED. Mortality rates doubled, but the difference was not statistically significant. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Digital Eye Strain Epidemic amid COVID-19 Pandemic - A Cross-sectional Survey. Purpose: There has been an enormous increase in the use of gadgets for online classes and entertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES. Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; chi2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.	false
0	Mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine in Italy against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This research aimed at investigating the psychological impact of national quarantine in Italy, and the psychosocial factors that are may influence this impact., METHODS: A convenience sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak., RESULTS: Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study., CONCLUSION: The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine.	false

0	"Hospital-Based Donor Recruitment and Predonation Serologic Testing for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma. OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in potential donors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) may not be performed until after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for CCP may be an efficient way to identify potential donors prospectively., METHODS: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals in March and April 2020. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire and, if eligible, were asked for consent and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred for CCP collection., RESULTS: Of 179 patients screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for CCP donation. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23 of 51 participants with suspected COVID-19 and 66 of 77 participants with self-reported COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level met the US Food and Drug Administration criteria for ""high-titer"" CCP in 39% of participants confirmed by PCR, as measured by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed., CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-based CCP donor recruitment program can prospectively identify potential CCP donors. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels has implications for the selection of CCP units for transfusion. Copyright © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021. All rights reserved.

0	Breast Cancer Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Validation of a Preventive Program for Patients and Health Care Workers. BACKGROUND/AIM: The perspective validation of a selective approach in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery was performed in order to assess whether patients as well as Health Care Workers (HCWs) were exposed to any undue risk of COVD-19 infection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 9th to June 9th 2020, 207 patients were phone-triaged by a dedicated Breast Care Nurse; a patient-tailored program was adopted with the aim of avoiding hospitalization of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients, with a careful prioritization of surgical procedures according to specific disease features., RESULTS: Two hundred and three out of 207 patients underwent operation; seven patients were temporarily excluded because they tested positive at phone triage (n=3), or in-hospital triage (n=3); another asymptomatic patient with negative NP swab tested IgM Ab-positive so that surgery was re-scheduled two weeks later. Four patients had no surgery; one of them was reconsidered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) after testing positive at phone triage; three patients were excluded because they were already hospitalized for COVID-19. Overall, mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (+/-SD, 0.7) and, after hospital discharge, no patient required readmission., CONCLUSION: This preventive program avoided any COVID-19 infection among patients and HCWs, so that an elective breast cancer surgical procedure can be safely and timely pursued without affecting the oncologic outcome.

0	Paired heavy and light chain signatures contribute to potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in public antibody responses. <h4>Summary</h4> Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients. These data reveal key structural and functional neutralization features in the IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class to accelerate antibody-based medical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Highlights</h4> A molecular study of IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody responses reveals critical heavy and light chain features for potent neutralization Cryo-EM analyses detail the structure of a novel public antibody class member, antibody 910-30, in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer Cryo-EM data reveal that 910-30 can both bind assembled trimer and can disassemble the SARS-CoV-2 spike Sequence-structure-function signatures defined for IGHV3-53/3-66 class antibodies including both heavy and light chains IGHV3-53/3-66 class precursors have a prevalence of 1:44,000 B cells in healthy human antibody repertoires	false
0	Endotracheal Tube Obstruction Among Patients Mechanically Ventilated for ARDS Due to COVID-19: A Case Series. BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction that has not been previously described in patients with ARDS due to other causes. The purpose of this report is to describe a case series of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS in which ETT occlusion resulted in significant clinical consequences and to define the pathology of the obstructing material., METHODS: Incidents of ETT occlusion during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients were reported by clinicians and retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed comparing event rates between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients on mechanical ventilation over the predefined period. Specimens were collected and submitted for pathological examination., FINDINGS: Eleven COVID-19 patients experienced endotracheal tube occlusion over a period of 2 months. Average age was 69 (14.3, range 33-85) years. Mean APACHE III score was 73.6 (17.3). All patients had AKI and cytokine storm. Nine exhibited biomarkers for hypercoagulability. Average days on mechanical ventilation before intervention for ETT occlusion was 14 (5.18) days (range of 9 to 23 days). Five patients were discharged from the ICU, and 4 expired. Average documented airway resistance on admission was 14.2 (3.0) cm H2O/L/sec. Airway resistance before tube exchange was 28.1 (8.0) cm H2O /L/sec. No similar events of endotracheal tube occlusion were identified in non-COVID patients on mechanical ventilation during the same time period. Microscopically, the material consisted of mucin admixed with necrotic cell debris, variable numbers of degenerated inflammatory cells, oral contaminants and red blood cells., INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ETT obstruction due to deposition of a thick, tenacious material within the tube that consists primarily of mucin and cellular debris. Clinicians should be aware of this dangerous but treatable complication.	false
0	Estimating the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with rituximab use for pemphigus vulgaris. The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised new uncertainties for dermatologists and their patients, importantly concerning initiation and continuation of immunosuppressants for dermatological conditions at this time. We review two phase III trials of rituximab, a chimeric CD20 monoclonal antibody, used for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Without specific data studying rituximab use and susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2, we hope to utilize available data in order to assist clinician decision making for rituximab in the context of the pandemic.	false
0	Differential Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Patients Presenting to a Neurological Emergency Room Depending on Their Triage Score in an Area with low COVID-19 Incidence. BACKGROUND: We analyzed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on neurological emergencies, depending on their triage score in a setting with relatively few COVID-19 cases without lack of resources., METHODS: Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with dedicated neurological emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke and the quality of stroke care., RESULTS: 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p=0.015). Median numbers of patients per week with triage 1 (emergent) and 4 (nonurgent) were comparable (51 [43-58] vs. 59 [54-62]; p=0.132 and 10 [4-16] vs. 16 [7-18]; p=0.310, respectively). The median number of patients per week declined in categories 2 and 3 in 2020 (41 [37-45] vs. 57 [52-61]; p=0.004 and 28 [23-35] vs. 61 [52-63]; p=0.002, respectively. No change was observed in the absolute number of strokes (138 in 2019 and 141 in 2020). Quality metrics of stroke revascularization therapies (symptom-to-door time, door-to-needle time or relative number of therapies) and stroke severity remained constant., CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period in 2020, number of patients with emergent symptoms remained constant, while fewer patients with urgent symptoms were presented. This may imply behavioral changes in care seeking behavior. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

Using self-reported data from 1 960 242 unique users in Great Britain (GB) of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app, we estimated that, concurrent to the GB government sanctioning lockdown, COVID-19 was distributed across GB, with evidence of 'urban hotspots'. We found a geo-social gradient associated with predicted disease prevalence suggesting urban areas and areas of higher deprivation are most affected. Our results demonstrate use of self-reported symptoms data to provide focus on geographical areas with identified risk factors. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.	false
0	COVID-19 in Pediatric Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis. The confirmed cases with COVID-19 in children account for just 1% of the overall confirmed cases. Severe COVID-19 in children is rare. Case Presentation: Our patient was 16 years old with a severe case of COVID-19 and did not survive due to the presence of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and being treated with immunosuppressive drugs. We used lopinavir, ritonavir, hydroxy chloroquine, intravenous immunoglobulin and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis for treatment. Conclusion : In this patient, an underlying disease and delayed admission to the hospital were two factors complicating his condition.	false
0	COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy in the United States: A Rapid National Assessment. Given the results from early trials, COVID-19 vaccines will be available by 2021. However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelor's degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.	false
0	"An integrated in silico immuno-genetic analytical platform provides insights into COVID-19 serological and vaccine targets. During COVID-19, diagnostic serological tools and vaccines have been developed. To inform control activities in a post-vaccine surveillance setting, we have developed an online ""immuno-analytics"" resource that combines epitope, sequence, protein and SARS-CoV-2 mutation analysis. SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins are both vaccine and serological diagnostic targets. Using the tool, the nucleocapsid protein appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological platforms. Spike D614G (and nsp12 L314P) mutations were most frequent (> 86%), whilst spike A222V/L18F have recently increased. Also, Orf3a proteins may be a suitable target for serology. The tool can accessed from: http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno (online); https://github.com/dan-ward-bio/COVID-immunoanalytics (source code)."	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, associated zoonotic concerns, and importance of the One Health approach during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has now affected over 72.5 million people worldwide, with nearly 1.6 million deaths reported globally as of December 17, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to have originated from bats and pangolins, and its intermediate animal hosts are being investigated. Crossing of the species barrier and exhibition of zoonosis have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 in farm (minks), domesticated (cats and dogs), and wild animals (tigers, puma, and lions). Recently, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in mink farms, which led to the death of a myriad minks. The clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rapid animal-to-animal transmission in minks are almost similar to the findings observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid virus transmission among minks and the associated mutations resulted in a new mink-associated variant that was identified in both minks and humans, thereby providing evidence of mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The new mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a possible reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies poses serious risks and is expected to have a direct effect on the diagnostic techniques, therapeutics, and vaccines that are currently under development. This article highlights the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, and provides an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in minks and the associated zoonotic concerns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from minks to humans with an emphasis on appropriate mitigation measures and on the necessity of adopting the One Health approach during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Development and Evaluation of Two Rapid Indigenous IgG-ELISA immobilized with ACE-2 Binding Peptides for Detection Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 pandemic situation demands effective serological tests with a view to adopting and developing policy for disease management, determining protective immunity as well as for sero-epidemiological study. Our study aims to develop and evaluate two rapid in-house ELISA assays targeting neutralizing antibodies (IgG) against S1 subunit of spike in SARS-CoV-2 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), as well as comparative analysis with nucleocapsid (NCP) ELISA. The assays were conducted with 184 samples in three panels collected from 134 patients. Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (r s =0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (r s =0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (r s =0.740, p<0.0001). Our study suggests S1-ELISA as more sensitive one than the RBD or nucleocapsid ELISA during the later phase of infection, while for overall sero-monitoring RBD specific IgG ELISA is recommended. Moreover, non-reactivity to dengue emphasize the use of these assays for serosurveillance of COVID-19 in the dengue endemic regions. <h4>Highlights</h4> The total assay time of these assays are 30 minutes. Sensitivity of S1 specific IgG ELISA for samples tested within 14 days of disease presentation is 73.68% while RBD specific ELISA demonstrates a sensitivity of 84.21%, Both of the assays under investigation can successfully detect all the cases (100% sensitivity) if the samples are tested after 14 days of onset of diseases. Specificity of S1-ELISA assay is 100%, whereas RBD specific IgG ELISA is 99% specific. The assays can be employed in dengue-endemic countries Among the three in-house IgG ELISA, assay system specific to S1 is found to be more sensitive and specific for retrospective serosurveillance. For acute to late phase, as well as retrospective serosurveillance of COVID-19, RBD-ELISA can be a method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 prevalent areas.	false

0	Clinical characteristics and short-term prognosis of in-patients with diabetes and COVID-19: A retrospective study from an academic center in Belgium. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We describe the characteristics and short-term prognosis of in-patients with diabetes and COVID-19 admitted to a Belgian academic care center., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data on admission from patients with known or newly-diagnosed diabetes and confirmed COVID-19. First, survivors were compared to non-survivors to study the predictive factors of in-hospital death in patients with diabetes. Secondly, diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were matched for age and sex with non-diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, to study the prognosis and predictive factors of in-hospital death related to diabetes., RESULTS: Seventy-three diabetic patients were included. Mean age was 69 (+/-14) years. Women accounted for 52%. Most patients had type 2 diabetes (89.0%), long-term complications of hyperglycemia (59.1%), and hypertension (80.8%). The case-fatality rate (CFR) was 15%. Non-survivors had more severe pneumonia based on imaging (p 0.029) and were less often treated with metformin (p 0.036). In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, CFR was 15.6% in diabetic (n = 64) and 25.0% in non-diabetic patients (n = 128), the difference being non-significant (p 0.194). Predictive factors of in-hospital death were elevated white blood cells count (HR 9.4, CI 1.50-58.8, p 0.016) and severe pneumonia on imaging (HR 25.0, CI 1.34-466, p 0.031) in diabetic patients, and cognitive impairment (HR 5.80, CI 1.61-20.9, p 0.007) and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.63, CI 1.54-20.6, p 0.009) in non-diabetic patients., CONCLUSION: In this monocentric cohort from Belgium, diabetic in-patients with COVID-19 had mostly type 2 diabetes, prevalent hyperglycemia-related vascular complications and comorbidities including hypertension. In this cohort, the CFR was not statistically different between patients with and without diabetes. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Coronavirus Infections and Deaths by Poverty Status: The Effects of Social Distancing. We study the spread of COVID-19 infections and deaths by county poverty level in the US. In the beginning of the pandemic, counties with either very low poverty levels or very high poverty levels reported the highest numbers of cases. A U-shaped relationship prevails for counties with high population density while among counties with low population density, only poorer counties report high incidence rates of COVID-19. Second, we discuss the pattern of infections spreading from higher to lower income counties. Third, we show that stay-at-home mandates caused significantly higher reductions in mobility in high income counties that experienced adverse weather shocks than counties that did not. These effects are not present in counties with high poverty rates. Using weather shocks in combination with stay-at-home mandates as an instrument for social distancing, we find that measures taken to promote social distancing helped curb infections in high income counties but not in low income counties. These results have important policy implications for containing the spread of infectious diseases in the future. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Community-aquired pneumonia on the background of coronaviral disease (COVID-19): principles of diagnostics and determination of risk factors of pathological process aggravation. The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on the background of COVID-19 is especially actual due to the prevalence of this pathology and the possible aggravation of the pathological process. The aim of our study was to improve the principles of CAP diagnostics on the background of COVID-19 and to determine risk factors for aggravating of the pathological process. Patients with respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 were examined. General clinical research methods were carried out, determination of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by PCR method, computer tomography (CT) to identify the features of lung tissue damage was performed. The main observation group consisted of 37 patients (men-19 (51.4%), average age-61 (57; 69) years) with pneumonia on the background of confirmed COVID-19. According to the severity of coronavirus disease, all patients of the main group were divided into 3 subgroups: subgroup 1 included 17 people with moderate COVID-19, subgroup 2-13 people with severe COVID-19, subgroup 3-7 people with critical COVID-19 course. The levels of markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein (C-RP) and fibrinogen) were also determined. Since patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity (which is characterized by the presence of community-acquired viral pneumonia) belong to the risk group of severe and critical course, it is suggested to consider the following risk factors for aggravating the pathological process as: temperature over 38.5 degrees C, heart rate over 90 per minute, respiratory rate over 20 per minute, SpO(2) <= 93%; absolute lymphopenia (less than 0.9 G/L) and an increase in serum levels of C-RP more than 50 mg/L and fibrinogen more than 5 g/L.	false
0	THE SEARCH FOR AN ASSOCIATION OF HLA ALLELES AND COVID-19 RELATED MORTALITY IN THE RUSSIAN POPULATION. HLA genes play a pivotal role in an immune response via the presentation of pathogen peptides in a complex on the surface of cells of a host organism. Here, we studied the association of class I and class II genes with the severity of COVID-19 infection and HLA allele variants. We performed high-resolution sequencing of class I and class II HLA genes using the sample population of 147 patients who died of COVID-19 and statistically compared our results with the frequencies of the HLA genotypes in a control population of 270 samples. The obtained data demonstrated that 51:05 and 15:18 alleles from locus B* are statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 severity, while C*14:02 allele correlates with the probability of death from COVID-19 for patients without comorbidities.	false
0	Clinical Validation of a Novel T-cell Receptor Sequencing Assay for Identification of Recent or Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> While diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development in the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded at unprecedented speed and scale, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Current diagnostic strategies, including serology, have numerous limitations in addressing these gaps. Here we describe clinical performance of T- Detect™ COVID, the first reported assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and immune repertoire profiling from whole blood samples. <h4>Methods</h4> <h4>Methods: </h4> for high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCRβ gene from blood specimens have been described 1 . We developed a statistical classifier showing high specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 2 , utilizing >4,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences from 784 cases and 2,447 controls across 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect COVID Assay comprises immunosequencing and classifier application to yield a qualitative positive or negative result. Several retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled to assess assay performance including primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA; N=205, N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87, N=79); PPA compared to serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38). <h4>Results</h4> T-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1% 15+ days from diagnosis; 94.5% 15+ days from symptom onset), high NPA (∼100%) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than two commercial EUA serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity. <h4>Conclusion</h4> T-Detect COVID is a novel T-cell immunosequencing assay demonstrating high clinical performance to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from standard blood samples. This assay can provide critical insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with potential implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing protective immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.	false

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic, in which a plethora of false information has been rapidly disseminated online, leading to serious harm around the world., OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze the prevalence of common misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic., METHODS: We conducted an online survey via a survey company and social media platforms to ask whether respondents have been exposed to a broad set of false claims regarding the disease and their respective fact-checks., RESULTS: We obtained more than 41,000 responses from 85 countries by 1,257 respondents, and we identified a strong negative correlation between a country's economic status and the prevalence of the misinformation (Spearman's rho=-0.72, P<.001). Our results suggest that fact-checks spread to a lesser degree than their respective false claims following a sublinear trend (beta=0.64)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the potential harm of misinformation could be more substantial for developing countries than developed economies. Countries with poor infrastructures might not only have to combat the spreading pandemic but also the COVID-19 infodemic, which can derail crucial efforts in saving lives., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	A retrospective view of pediatric cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 of a middle-sized city in mainland China. ABSTRACT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had resulted in a global pandemic. A comprehensive analysis of pediatric COVID-19 cases is essential to decipher the natural features of children under the risk of this disease. In the epidemic period, all the children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuxi, a city with a stable medical system during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, were enrolled for comprehensive data documenting their clinical, prognosis, follow-up, treatment and various tests results. Combing their family cluster characteristics, the epidemiological, hospitalization, and transmission features of children with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed and discussed.A total of 7 children were enrolled, including 4 mild cases, 1 moderate case, and 2 asymptomatic cases. The common symptoms were fever and dry cough. The length of viral nucleic acid duration in nasopharynx varied and was irrelevant to the severity of the symptom, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Two cases showed viral nucleic acid positive recurrence after discharge from the hospital. A child with type 1 diabetes was also focused, for the elevated blood sugar during hospitalization. All these children had close contacts with their family members, some of those were confirmed COVID-19 cases. We provided a holistic and detailed portrayal of the pediatric COVID-19 cases in a typical city of timely response to the epidemic. While the family cluster exhibits the major transmission mode, attention should be paid for the potential risk since the expanded social space of children in future. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

0	Fever, Diarrhea, and Severe Disease Correlate with High Persistent Antibody Levels against SARS-CoV-2. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Our results provide new insights into the development and persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.	false

0	Bounding the Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, With Application to COVID-19 Antibody Tests. Tests used to diagnose illness commonly have imperfect accuracy, with some false-positive and negative results. For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill. The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a person's illness status. These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence. I explain the problem and show how to bound PPV and NPV as well as the risk ratio and difference, which are functions thereof. I apply the findings to COVID-19 antibody tests. I question the realism of supposing that sensitivity and specificity are known. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Neutralization assay with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped murine leukemia virions. BACKGROUND: Virus neutralization by antibodies is an important prognostic factor in many viral diseases. To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal murine leukemia virus genome encoding firefly luciferase. This assay design is intended for use in laboratories with biocontainment level 2 and therefore circumvents the need for the biocontainment level 3 that would be required for replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus. To validate the pseudovirion assay, we set up comparisons with other available antibody tests including those from Abbott, Euroimmun and Siemens, using archived, known samples., RESULTS: 11 out of 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT50) that ranged from 1:25 to 1:1,417. Five historical samples from patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016 tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT50 < 25). Three serum samples with high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2/MLV pseudoviruses showed no detectable neutralizing activity (NT50 < 25) against SARS-CoV-1/MLV pseudovirions. We also compared the semiquantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which measures binding of IgG to recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the neutralization titers obtained in the pseudovirion assay and the results show high concordance between the two tests (R2 = 0.9344)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spike/MLV pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing neutralizing activity of antibodies in serum or plasma from infected patients under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2. This assay offers promise also in evaluating immunogenicity of spike glycoprotein-based candidate vaccines in the near future.	false
0	Facial Pressure Injuries from Prone Positioning in the COVID-19 Era. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to determine the incidence of facial pressure injuries associated with prone positioning for COVID-19 patients as well as to characterize the location of injuries and treatments provided., METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 263 COVID-19 positive patients requiring intubation in the intensive care units at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and MedStar Washington Hospital Center between March 1st and July 26th, 2020. Information regarding proning status, duration of proning, presence, or absence of facial pressure injuries and interventions were collected. Paired two-tailed t-test was used to evaluate differences between proned patients who developed pressure injuries with those who did not., RESULTS: Overall, 143 COVID-19 positive patients required proning while intubated with the average duration of proning being 5.15 days. Of those proned, 68 (47.6%) developed a facial pressure injury. The most common site involved was the cheek with a total of 57 (84%) followed by ears (50%). The average duration of proning for patients who developed a pressure injury was significantly longer when compared to those who did not develop pressure injuries (6.79 days vs. 3.64 days, P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Facial pressure injuries occur with high incidence in patients with COVID-19 who undergo prone positioning. Longer duration of proning appears to confer greater risk for developing these pressure injuries. Hence, improved preventative measures and early interventions are needed., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2021.

0	Are asymptomatic gastrointestinal findings on imaging more common in COVID-19 infection? Study to determine frequency of abdominal findings of COVID-19 infection in patients with and without abdominal symptoms and in patients with chest-only CT scans. PURPOSE: To identify incidence of abdominal findings in COVID-19 patients with and without abdominal symptoms on various imaging modalities including chest-only CT scans and to correlate them with clinical, laboratory and chest CT findings., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we searched our clinical database between March 1st, 2020 and May 22nd, 2020 to identify patients who had positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat swabs for COVID-19, had availability of clinical, laboratory information and had availability of CT scan of chest or abdominal radiograph, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan within 2 weeks of the diagnosis. Abdominal imaging findings on all imaging modalities were documented. Chest CT severity score (CT-SS) was assessed in all patients. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded from the electronic medical record. Statistical analysis was performed to determine correlation of abdominal findings with CT-SS, clinical and laboratory findings., RESULTS: Out of 264 patients with positive RT-PCR, 73 patients (38 males and 35 females; 35 African American) with mean age of 62.2 (range 21-94) years were included. The median CTSS was 13.5 (IQR 75-25 18-8). Most common finding in the abdomen on CT scans (n = 72) were in the gastrointestinal system in 13/72 patients (18.1%) with fluid-filled colon without wall thickening or pericolonic stranding (n = 12) being the most common finding. Chest-only CT (n = 49) found bowel findings in 3 patients. CTSS did not differ in terms of age, sex, race or number of comorbidities but was associated with longer duration of hospitalization (p = 0.0.0256), longer intensive care unit stay (p = 0.0263), more frequent serum lactate dehydrogenase elevation (p = 0.0120) and serum C-reactive protein elevation (p = 0.0402). No statistically significant correlation of occurrence of bowel abnormalities with CTSS, clinical or laboratory features. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 7/72 patients (9.8%) with three patients developing pulmonary embolism CONCLUSION: Abnormal bowel is the most common finding in the abdomen in patients with COVID-19 infection, is often without abdominal symptoms and occurs independent of severity of pulmonary involvement, other clinical and laboratory features.	false
0	The Impact of COVID-19 Surge on Clinical Palliative Care: A Descriptive Study From a New York Hospital System. CONTEXT: In spring 2020, New York experienced a surge of patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) disease, as part of a global pandemic. There are limited data on populations of COVID-19-infected patients seen by palliative care services., OBJECTIVE: To describe a palliative care population at one New York hospital system during the initial pandemic surge., METHODS: This repeated cross-sectional, observational study collected data on palliative care patients in a large health system seen during the COVID-19 outbreak and compared it with pre-COVID data., RESULTS: Palliative service volume surged from 678 (4% of total admissions) before COVID-19 to 1071 (10% of total admissions) during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the outbreak, 695 (64.9%) of the total palliative patients tested positive for the virus. Compared with a preoutbreak group, this COVID-19-positive group had higher rates of male (60.7% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.01) and Latino (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01) patients and less white patients (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01). Our patients with COVID-19 also had greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes and lower rates of end-stage organ disease and cancers. The COVID-19-positive group had a higher rate of intensive care unit admissions (58.9% vs. 33.9%; P < 0.01) and in-hospital mortality rate (57.4% vs. 13.1%; P < 0.01) than the preoutbreak group. There was increased odds of mortality in palliative care patients who were COVID-19 positive (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 2.43-4.24) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (odds ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.9)., CONCLUSION: During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, palliative care services experienced a large surge of patients who tended to be healthier at baseline and more acutely ill at the time of admission than pre-COVID-19 palliative patients.

0	Religious coping in the time of COVID-19 Pandemic in India and Nigeria: Finding of a cross-national community survey. BACKGROUND: Religious and spiritual coping strategies is one of the possible tools that can be used to deal with stress and the negative consequences of life problems and illnesses. The study aims to assess religious coping in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODOLOGY: It was an online survey. The sample was collected using a snowball sampling technique as the data were collected through Google forms. The survey started on 22 April 2020 and was closed on 28 May 2020. The participants were from two countries, India and Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, having completed at least 10 years of formal education, and have internet access. For data collection, Semi-structured proforma (demographic and personal characteristics) and Brief RCOPE was used to see the extent to which individuals engage in positive and negative forms of religious coping., RESULTS: A total of 647 individuals (360 from Nigeria and 287 from India) participated in the survey. A total of 188 (65.5%) participants in India reported no change in their religious activities since they heard about COVID-19, while, 160 (44.4%) in Nigeria reported a decrease in religious activities. Positive religious coping in the Nigerian population was significantly higher than the Indian population. Similarly, negative religious coping was significantly higher (for most of the items in the brief RCOPE) in the Indian population than the Nigerian population., CONCLUSION: Significant percentages of people after the COVID-19 pandemic took religious coping steps to overcome their problems. During this pandemic, positive religious coping among the Indian and Nigerian communities is more prevalent than negative religious coping. There is a substantial cross-national difference between Indians and Nigerians in the religious coping modes.	false
0	Association between physical activity and subjective memory decline triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PAMPA cohort. Implementation of social distancing reduced the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases. Nevertheless, this strategy has other undesirable effects such as physical inactivity and psychological distress, which are associated with cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine whether physical activity during social distancing restrictions could reduce the risk of subjective memory decline in adults. Participants (n=2321) completed the baseline assessment of PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health), a ambispective cohort study conducted in southern Brazil. An online-based, self-administered questionnaire assessed physical activity and self-rated memory in two different periods: before and during social distancing. Data collection was executed from June 22nd to July 23rd 2020. Adjusted Poisson regression models were performed and values reported in prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Participants presented with a mean age of 38.2 (95%CI: 37.5, 38.9) years. Most were women (76.6%), had at least a university degree (66.7%), and were overweight or obese (53.3%). Subjective memory decline was reported by 30.0% (95%CI: 27.7%, 32.4%) of respondents. Most individuals with subjective memory decline reported being physically inactive during the pandemic of COVID-19. Participants were less likely to experience subjective memory decline if they either became (PR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.89) or remained (PR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.93) physically active compared to inactive respondents. Physical activity participation during social distancing reduced the likelihood of subjective memory decline in adults. Physical activity should be highlighted as a potential alternative to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive function and mental health. Copyright © 2021.

0	Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England. A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number R t to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.	false
0	Probability that an infection like Covid-19 stops without reaching herd immunity, calculated with a stochastic agent-based model. The spread of an infection is simulated with a stochastic agent-based model. In a certain range of R0 values, the infection either rapidly comes to halt or a large proportion of the population is infected until herd immunity is achieved. Which of these two possibilities actually occurs is random. The probability of each case is determined ‘quasi-empirically’. This stochastic phenomenon may explain unexpected infection trajectories.	false
0	Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada. OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic., METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year., RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4-6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31-38% of the population, within 3-4 months of initial relaxation., CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.	false
0	UV, Ozone, and COVID-19 Transmission in Ontario, Canada using Generalised Linear Models. BACKGROUND: Quantifying the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 transmission is crucial in preventing more cases. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone (O3) have reported antimicrobial properties but few studies have examined associations with community infectivity of COVID-19. Research suggests UV light can be preventative while the effect of O3 is contested. We sought to determine the relationship between UV, O3, and COVID-19 incidence in Ontario, Canada., METHODS: In our time series analyses, we calculated daily incidence rates and reproductive number (Rt) from 34,975 cases between January and June 2020 across 34 Ontario Public Health Units. We used generalised linear models, adjusting for potential confounders, to calculate point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UV and O3. Analyses were further stratified by age groups and outbreaks at institutions versus community., RESULTS: We found that 1-week averaged UV was significantly associated with a 13% decrease (95% CI: 0.80-0.96) in overall COVID-19 Rt, per unit increase. A negative association with UV was also significant among community outbreaks (PE: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) but not institutional outbreaks (PE: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.03). A positive association of O3 with COVID-19 incidence is strongly suggested among institutional outbreak cases (PE: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13)., CONCLUSION: Our study found evidence to support the hypothesis that higher UV reduced transmission of COVID-19 and some evidence that ground-level O3 positively influenced COVID-19 transmission. Setting of infection should be strongly considered as a factor in future research. UV and O3 may explain some of COVID-19's seasonal behaviour. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Hydroxychloroquine as a Chemoprophylactic Agent for COVID-19: A Clinico-Pharmacological Review. Hydroxychloroquine has gained much attention as one of the candidate drugs that can be repurposed as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high transmissibility and presence of asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic transmission, there is need for a chemoprophylactic agent to protect the high-risk population. In this review, we dissect the currently available evidence on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis from a clinical and pharmacological point of view. In vitro studies on Vero cells show that hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by affecting viral entry and viral transport via endolysosomes. However, this efficacy has failed to replicate in in vivo animal models as well as in most clinical observational studies and clinical trials assessing pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. An analysis of the pharmacology of HCQ in COVID-19 reveals certain possible reasons for this failure-a pharmacokinetic failure due to failure to achieve adequate drug concentration at the target site and attenuation of its inhibitory effect due to the presence of TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells. Currently, many clinical trials on HCQ prophylaxis in HCW are ongoing; these factors should be taken into account. Using higher doses of HCQ for prophylaxis is likely to be associated with increased safety concerns; thus, it may be worthwhile to focus on other possible interventions.

0	CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to global public health. Rapid development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines are imperative to control the pandemic. In the current study, we applied our adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based vaccine, MVC-COV1901, to hamster models to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from virus challenge. Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 μg or 5 μg of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups. Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals. Vaccination with either 1 μg or 5 μg of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection. This study builds upon our previous results to support the clinical development of MVC-COV1901 as a safe, highly immunogenic, and protective COVID-19 vaccine.	false
0	An engineered decoy receptor for SARS-CoV-2 broadly binds protein S sequence variants. The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE2 2 .v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD, which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage (B.1.1.7) in England, enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to engineered sACE22.v2.4. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.	false
0	Structural basis for broad coronavirus neutralization. Three highly pathogenic beta-coronaviruses crossed the animal-to-human species barrier in the past two decades: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight beta-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting beta-coronaviruses, and broadly inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with beta-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-of-concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination. This study unveils an unexpected target for next-generation structure-guided design of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.	false
0	Tetravalent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Show Enhanced Potency and Resistance to Escape Mutations. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) hold promise as effective therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we describe protein engineering and modular design principles that have led to the development of synthetic bivalent and tetravalent nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. The best nAb targets the host receptor binding site of the viral S-protein and its tetravalent versions can block entry with a potency that exceeds the bivalent nAbs by an order of magnitude. Structural studies show that both the bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can make multivalent interactions with a single S-protein trimer, observations consistent with the avidity and potency of these molecules. Significantly, we show that the tetravalent nAbs show much increased tolerance to potential virus escape mutants. Bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can be produced at large-scale and are as stable and specific as approved antibody drugs. Our results provide a general framework for developing potent antiviral therapies against COVID-19 and related viral threats, and our strategy can be readily applied to any antibody drug currently in development.	false
0	Severe SARS-CoV-2 patients develop a higher specific T-cell response. Objectives: Assessment of the adaptive immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for studying long-term immunity and vaccine strategies. We quantified IFNgamma-secreting T cells reactive against the main viral SARS-CoV-2 antigens using a standardised enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot)., Methods: Overlapping peptide pools built from the sequences of M, N and S viral proteins and a mix (MNS) were used as antigens. Using IFNgamma T-CoV-Spot assay, we assessed T-cell and antibody responses in mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 patients and in control samples collected before the outbreak., Results: Specific T cells were assessed in 60 consecutive patients (mild, n = 26; moderate, n = 10; and severe patients, n = 24) during their follow-up (median time from symptom onset [interquartile range]: 36 days [28;53]). T cells against M, N and S peptide pools were detected in n = 60 (100%), n = 56 (93.3%), n = 55 patients (91.7%), respectively. Using the MNS mix, IFNgamma T-CoV-Spot assay showed a specificity of 96.7% (95% CI, 88.5-99.6%) and a specificity of 90.3% (75.2-98.0%). The frequency of reactive T cells observed with M, S and MNS mix pools correlated with severity and with levels of anti-S1 and anti-RBD serum antibodies., Conclusion: IFNgamma T-CoV-Spot assay is a reliable method to explore specific T cells in large cohorts of patients. This test may become a useful tool to assess the long-lived memory T-cell response after vaccination. Our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 patients developing a severe disease achieve a higher adaptive immune response. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"May the analysis of 1918 influenza pandemic give hints to imagine the possible magnitude of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)?. BACKGROUND: In 1918 an unknown infectious agent spread around the world infecting over one-third of the general population and killing almost 50 million people. Many countries were at war, the First World War. Since Spain was a neutral country and Spanish press could report about the infection without censorship, this condition is commonly remembered as ""Spanish influenza"". This review examines several aspects during the 1918 influenza pandemic to bring out evidences which might be useful to imagine the possible magnitude of the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: In the first part of this review we will examine the origin of the SARS-Coronavirus-2 and 1918 Spanish Influenza Virus and the role played by host and environment in its diffusion. We will also include in our analysis an evaluation of different approaches utilized to restrain the spread of pandemic and to treat infected patients. In the second part, we will try to imagine the magnitude of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the possible measures able to restrain in the present environment its spread., RESULTS: Several factors characterize the outcome in a viral pandemic infection. They include the complete knowledge of the virus, the complete knowledge of the host and of the environment where the host lives and the pandemic develops., CONCLUSION: By comparing the situation seen in 1918 with the current one, we are now in a more favourable position. The experience of the past teaches us that their success is linked to a rapid, constant and lasting application. Then, rather than coercion, awareness of the need to observe such prevention measures works better."	false
0	Screening and Testing Pregnant Patients for SARS-CoV-2: First-Wave Experience of a Designated COVID-19 Hospitalization Centre in Montreal. OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present asymptomatically in a large proportion of cases in endemic areas. Accordingly, universal testing has been suggested as a potential strategy for reducing transmission in the obstetrical setting. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy at a designated COVID-19 hospitalization centre in Montreal, Quebec., METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort was constructed to include all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 22 and July 31, 2020, and received care at the Jewish General Hospital. Initially, testing was restricted to at-risk patients, identified through the use of a screening questionnaire. Beginning on May 15, 2020, universal testing was implemented, and all pregnant patients admitted to the hospital were tested. Data were collected through chart review., RESULTS: Of 803 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, 41 (5%) tested positive. Among those patients who were symptomatic, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (53%), fever (37%), dyspnea (30%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20%). Before the implementation of universal testing, 13% (three of 24) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. After implementation of universal testing, 80% (eight of 10) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID-19. Particularly in endemic areas, universal testing of pregnant patients presenting to the hospital should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent in-hospital and community transmission of COVID-19.

0	Zoonotic origins and animal hosts of coronaviruses causing human disease pandemics: A review. The first known severe disease caused by a coronavirus (CoV) in humans emerged with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China, which killed 774 people during its 2002/2003 outbreak. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was the second human fatal disease, which started in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and resulted in 858 fatalities. In December 2019, a new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), originating from China, began generating headlines worldwide because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission; 5.2 million people were infected and 338 480 had been reported dead from December 2019 to May 2020. These human coronaviruses are believed to have an animal origin and had reached humans through species jump. Coronaviruses are well known for their high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, allowing them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. This review summarises existing information on what is currently known on the role of wild and domesticated animals and discussions on whether they are the natural reservoir/amplifiers hosts or incidental hosts of CoVs. Results of experimental infection and transmission using different wild, domesticated and pet animals are also reviewed. The need for a One Health approach in implementing measures and practices is highlighted to improve human health and reduce the emergence of pandemics from these zoonotic viruses.	false
0	Unraveling the mechanism of arbidol binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2: Insights from atomistic simulations. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an antiinfluenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is found to be superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to the host cells. However, the detailed mechanism through which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition by arbidol for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol could generate favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, resulting in a restriction of the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.

0	COVID-19 plasma deep proteome reveals distinct signatures in severe patients. Prognosis and management of COVID-19 severity is a challenge even after months of the pandemic. Host plasma proteome alterations carry insights into the physiological alterations in response to the infection. Here we employed a mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics approach to study alteration in plasma proteome in a cohort of 73 patients (20 COVID negative, 18 non-severe, and 33 severe) to understand the disease dynamics for addressing this challenge. Of the 1200 proteins detected in the patient plasma, 38 proteins were differentially expressed between non-severe and severe groups. The host proteins such as Angiotensinogen, apolipoprotein B, SERPINA3, SERPING1, and Fibrinogen gamma chain identified in LFQ analysis were further validated using targeted mass spectrometry assay. Utilizing our proteomics dataset, we identified multiple drugs that could inhibit the upregulated proteins involved in disease pathogenesis of these 2 FDA-approved drugs Selinexor and Ponatinib, which showed promise of being re-purposed for potential therapeutics of COVID-19. Plasma proteome identified significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, the results suggest that COVID-19 severity can be prognosticated using specific biomarkers of severity, and few of these proteins are excellent targets for re-purposed drugs.	false
0	Association of SARS-CoV-2 Clades with Clinical, Inflammatory and Virologic Outcomes: An Observational Study. Background: Host determinants of severe coronavirus disease 2019 include advanced age, comorbidities and male sex. Virologic factors may also be important in determining clinical outcome and transmission rates, but limited patient-level data is available. <br><br>Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study at seven public hospitals in Singapore. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between individuals infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. Firth’s logistic regression was used to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and development of hypoxia, and quasi-Poisson regression to compare transmission rates. Plasma samples were tested for immune mediator levels and the kinetics of viral replication in cell culture were compared. <br><br>Findings: 319 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had clinical and virologic data available for analysis. 29 (9%) were infected with clade S, 90 (28%) with clade L/V, 96 (30%) with clade G (containing D614G variant), and 104 (33%) with other clades ‘O’ were assigned to lineage B.6. After adjusting for age and other covariates, infections with clade S (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0·030 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0·0002-0·29)) or clade O (B·6) (aOR 0·26 (95% CI 0·064-0·93)) were associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen compared with clade L/V. Patients infected with clade L/V had more pronounced systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. No significant difference in the severity of clade G infections was observed (aOR 0·95 (95% CI: 0·35-2·52). Though viral loads were significantly higher, there was no evidence of increased transmissibility of clade G, and replicative fitness in cell culture was similar for all clades. <br><br>Interpretation: Infection with clades L/V was associated with increased severity and more systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Infection with clade G was not associated with changes in severity, and despite higher viral loads there was no evidence of increased transmissibility.<br><br>Funding Statement: This study was funded by grants from the Singapore National Medical Research Council (COVID19RF- 001, COVID19RF2-0001, COVID19RF-007, and COVID19RF-60) and Biomedical Research Council (project number H20/04/g1/006).<br><br>Declaration of Interests: No conflicts of interest declared.<br><br>Ethics Approval Statement: The epidemiological investigation was conducted under the Infectious Diseases Act (Singapore). Study protocols were approved by ethics committees of the National Healthcare Group and SingHealth. Written informed consent was obtained from participants for clinical data and biological sample collection as part of the PROTECT study (2012/00917; 2018/3045). A waiver of informed consent for retrospective data collection only was granted for individuals admitted to the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (2020/01122). Healthy donor samples were collected under study numbers 2017/2806 and NUS IRB 04-140.	false
0	Serum ACE as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19: A case series. We have earlier proposed that serum ACE (s-ACE) could be used as a biomarker for severity in COVID-19 due to an assumed inverse relationship between ACE and ACE2. High s-ACE could indicate lower ACE2 activity and therefore more widespread and severe SARS-CoV2 infection, owing to virally mediated downregulation of ACE2 (1). Dysregulation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS) are found in comorbidities known as risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease (2).

0	Chronic comorbidities and clinical outcomes in patients with and without COVID-19: a large population-based study using national administrative healthcare open data of Mexico. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was rapidly expanded worldwide within a short period. Its relationship with chronic comorbidities is still unclear. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic comorbidities on clinical outcomes of patients with and without COVID-19. This was an analysis of 65,535 patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease (38,324 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 27,211 SARS-CoV-2 negative) from January 01 to May 12, 2020 using the national administrative healthcare open data of Mexico. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons). Chronic comorbidities are commonly found in patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease. The knowledge of the impact of comorbidities on adverse clinical outcomes can better define those COVID-19 patients at higher risk. The different impact of the specific type of chronic comorbidity on clinical outcomes in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further researches. These findings need confirmation using other data sources.	false
0	2019 novel coronavirus disease with secondary ischemic stroke: two case reports. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out in Wuhan in 2019, has become the global health crisis of our time. Elderly patients with certain fundamental diseases are more likely to develop severe cases. The secondary lesion following viral infection have only rarely been reported., CASE PRESENTATION: We here report two cases of coronavirus-infected pneumonia with acute ischemic stroke in middle-aged patients. In both COVID-19 cases, neurological physical examinations showed normal results before infection. Lymphocytopenia, accompanied by elevated cytokines and D-dimers, were found from serum clinical laboratory examination at admission. Dysarthria and limb muscle weakness are initial manifestations, occurring one week after infect-causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. The head CT and head/neck arterial CTA showed small-vessel occlusion. The patients were diagnosed with coronavirus diseases with secondary acute ischemic stroke. They were treated with tirofiban and followed up with daily aspirin and atorvastatin., CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggested that secondary ischemic stroke, mainly manifested as small-vessel occlusion, should be considered for COVID-19 patients and diagnosed and treated promptly.	false
0	How the world's collective attention is being paid to a pandemic: COVID-19 related n-gram time series for 24 languages on Twitter. In confronting the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic we must have coordinated medical, operational, and political responses. In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 2000 day-scale time series of 1- and 2-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most 'important' for April 2020 with respect to April 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for 'virus' in January 2020 followed by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as well as for retrospective investigations.	false
0	Is COVID-19 Gender-sensitive?. While clinical characteristics exhibit that susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equally likely between males and females, clinical outcomes show that males experience both a higher severity and fatality for COVID-19 infection than females. This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

0	Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Maxingshigan-Weijing in the management of COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test our expectation that additional administration of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), maxingshigan-weijing decoction, is more effective in the management of COVID-19 patients compared to those treated with routine supportive care alone., TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multicenter, open-label 2-arm (1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial., PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from 3 hospitals in Wenzhou China: the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and Wenzhou Center Hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria 1. Participants are 18-85 years of age, either male or female. 2. Diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3. Symptomatic. Mild (mild clinical symptoms without signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) and Moderate (fever or respiratory symptom with signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) . 1. Signed the informed consent before treatment. 2. Agreed not to enroll in any other clinical trials. 3. Inpatients Exclusion criteria 1. < 18 or > 85 years old. 2. Pregnancy and lactation. 3. Serious heart, liver, kidney and hematopoietic system diseases, abnormal liver or kidney function. 4. Suffering from other known virus pneumonia. 5. Allergic to Chinese herbal medicine or suffering from allergies. 6. Critical patients (respiratory failure treated by mechanical ventilation or shock or multiple organ failure)., INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the control group will receive routine supportive clinically care including the therapies of anti-viral, anti-bacterial and ameliorating the related symptoms, while patients in TCM group will be asked to take maxingshigan-weijing decoction (composed of 14 Chinese herbal medicines), orally 200 mL 2 times daily, for 14 consecutive days in addition to routine supportive care as mentioned above. Maxingshigan-weijing decoction consists of 10 g of Herba Ephedra (Mahuang), 10 g of Amygdalus Communis Vas (Xingren), 45 g of Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao), 30 g of Rhizoma phragmitis (Lugen), 20 g of Peach kernel (Taoren), 20 g of Winter Melon kernel (Dongguaren), 30 g of Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maxim (Gualou), 12 g of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi), 12 g of Rhizoma Pinelliae (Jiangbanxia), 12 g of caulis bambusae in taeniis (Zhuru), 30 g of semen lepidii (Tingliz), 15 g of semen lepidii (Shichangpu), 10 g of curcuma zedoary (ezhu) and 5 g of Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gancao)., MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the number of days until the clinical symptom of fever improves in the first 14 days of treatment following randomisation. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37degreeC. Secondary outcomes will be TCM Syndrome Scores, the time it takes until individuals have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, the proportion of cases with chest X-ray improvements and the rate of symptom (fever, cough, malaise, shortness of breath) recovery. TCM Syndrome Scoring System is a checklist covering 4 main, 7 secondary and 13 accompanying items. The 4 main items consisting of fever, cough, malaise and shortness of breath, use a four-point scale (0, 2, 4 and 6) depending on the severity; the 7 secondary items including dysphoria, diarrhea, pharyngalgia, expectoration, muscular soreness, nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea use 0-3-point scale; the 13 accompanying items contain chest pain, headache, aversion to cold, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal distension, dry mouth, anxiety, spontaneous sweating, insomnia, wheezing and blood tinged sputum, and each item is rated on 0-1 scale ( 0 stands for asymptomatic, 1 stands for symptomatic ). The total scores sum up to a range from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating more severe levels of disease., RANDOMIZATION: Minimization method will be used, balancing the two arms for pneumonia severity. Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group. Clinical researchers will get a random sequence number which is automatically generated by a random number generator (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and sequentially number them in an opaque envelope. Researchers will open random allocation envelopes and assign participants accordingly. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into a routine supportive care group and a routine supportive care plus oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine group, with 70 patients in each group., BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study. The statistical analysis will be carried out by the Professor of Statistics at Wenzhou Medical University, who is blinded to patient allocation., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The previous study reported the efficacy of TCM for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the TCM group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Accordingly, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test will be used. And assuming a statistical power of 70% (one-sided type-1 error of alpha = 5%, beta = 30%) and a rate of withdrawal and loss to follow-up of 10%, we plan to include 140 participants in both groups ( TCM group = 70, control group = 70)., TRIAL STATUS: The trial protocol is Version 2.0, October 14, 2020. Recruitment began March, 2020, and is anticipated to be completed by December 31, 2020., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000030759 . Registered on 13 March 2020., FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.	false
0	The role of sleep in telogen effluvium and trichodynia: a commentary in the context of the current pandemic. Telogen effluvium (TE), a common hair disease, is supposed to be related to stress, which could be secondary to poor sleep. We call attention to the current COVID-19 pandemic, that is leading to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and as a consequence, higher states of stress and anxiety, which are possible triggers for TE. In parallel, trichodynia is a sensorial symptom that is commonly related with hair diseases, including TE. We argue that substance P, a neuropeptide that has participation in the neuroinflammation and also in the sleep regulation, may play a possible role in this scalp paresthesia. We suggest that there may be an association between this substrate and sleep, which can aggravate trichodynia and TE. Further studies on this subject could provide more evidence on these relationships, and help to improve the patients' quality of life and management of the condition.

0	Deep Sequencing of B Cell Receptor Repertoires From COVID-19 Patients Reveals Strong Convergent Immune Signatures. Deep sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chains from a cohort of 31 COVID-19 patients from the UK reveals a stereotypical naive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which is consistent across patients. Clonal expansion of the B cell population is also observed and may be the result of memory bystander effects. There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and we identified 1,254 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients, but not present in healthy controls or individuals following seasonal influenza vaccination. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing antibodies. Convergence was also demonstrated across wide geographies by comparison of data sets between patients from UK, USA, and China, further validating the disease association and consistency of the stereotypical immune response even at the sequence level. These convergent clonotypes provide a resource to identify potential therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies and demonstrate the potential of BCR profiling as a tool to help understand patient responses.

0	Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic: A southern Italian single-center experience. Purpose: We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies performed during the lockdown imposed by the Italian Government from March 2020 to May 2020., Materials and method: We reviewed the number and the findings of CMR scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic between March and May 2020 at University of Naples Federico II. The number and the findings of CMR studies acquired in the corresponding months of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison., Results: A total of 117 CMR studies was considered, including the procedures performed during the pandemic (n = 18) and those performed in the corresponding months of the prior 3 years (n = 99). The number of CMR studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly (P < .01) lower compared to the mean number (n = 33) of the procedures performed in the corresponding months of 2017-2019. The percentage of abnormal CMR studies was similar (P = 0.73) during the pandemic (67 %) compared to that found in the corresponding months of 2017-2019 (70 %) suggesting that many abnormal tests were missed due to the lockdown., Conclusion: The number of CMR studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding period of the previous three years. The lack of difference in the prevalence of abnormal CMR studies between the two study time intervals strongly suggests that many patients with potentially abnormal imaging test have been missed during the pandemic.

0	Asymptomatic Cases and Limited Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Residents and Healthcare Workers in Three Dutch Nursing Homes. We aimed to assess the contribution of a- and presymptomatic residents and healthcare workers in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, including standardized symptom assessment and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, among 297 residents and 542 healthcare workers of three Dutch nursing homes (NHs) with recent SARS-CoV-2 introduction. At the first point-prevalence survey, 15 residents tested positive of which one was presymptomatic and three remained asymptomatic. At the second point-prevalence survey one resident and one healthcare worker tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and both remained asymptomatic. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified, this study confirms a- and presymptomatic occurrence of Covid-19. We additionally describe factors that may contribute to the prevention of transmission. Taken together, our study complements the discussion on effective SARS-CoV-2 screening in NHs.	false
0	"Intimate partner violence among antenatal care attendees amidst the COVID-19 crisis: The incidence in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy amidst the COVID19 pandemic., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the antenatal care clinic of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, among pregnant women from August 31 to November 2, 2020. participants were interviewed using Open Data Kit. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors., RESULTS: Among the 464 pregnant women, 33 (7.1%) reported IPV during pregnancy, and among these 24 (72.7%) reported emotional violence, 16 (48.5%) reported sexual violence and 10 (30.3%) reported physical violence. Among the study participants, only 8 (1.7%) were screened for IPV. IPV was reported 3.27 times as much among women who reported their partner chew ""Khat"" compared to those women whose partner do not (AOR 3.27; 95% C.I 1.45-7.38), and 1.52 times as much among women who reported that their partner drink alcohol compared to those women whose partner do not (AOR 1.52; 95% C.I 1.01-2.28)., CONCLUSION: Very few women were screened for IPV. Partners drinking alcohol and chewing Khat are significantly positively associated with IPV during pregnancy. IPV screening should be included in the national management protocol of obstetric cases of Ethiopia. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."	false
0	Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in recovered severe COVID-19 patients. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Objectives</h4> There is an imperative need to determine the durability of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells targeting S1 and M proteins and measured RBD-specific serum IgG over a period of 2-6 months after symptoms onset in a cohort of subjects who had recovered from severe clinical forms of COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> We recruited 58 patients (38 males and 20 females; median age, 62.5 years), who had been hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia, 60% with one or more comorbidities. IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69 + -expressing-IFNγ-producing-CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were enumerated in heparinized whole blood by flow cytometry for ICS. <h4>Results</h4> Detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M-reactive CD69 + -IFN-γ CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were displayed in 17 (29.3%) and 6 (10.3%) subjects respectively, at a median of 84 days after onset of symptoms (range, 58-191 days). Concurrent comorbidities increased the risk (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.03-9.61; P =0.04) of undetectable T-cell responses in models adjusted for age, sex and hospitalization ward. Twenty-one out of the 35 patients (60%) had detectable RBD-specific serum IgGs at a median of 118 days (range, 60 to 145 days) after symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG serum levels were found to drop significantly over time. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A relatively limited number of subjects who developed severe forms of COVID-19 had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M IFNγ CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at midterm after clinical diagnosis. Our data also indicated that serum levels of RBD-specific IgGs decline over time, becoming undetectable in some patients.	false
0	Evolution of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients in India. PURPOSE: The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading at an alarming rate across the globe. Sudden onset loss of smell and/or taste has been increasingly reported as a symptom of COVID-19. However, prevalence of these symptoms, and its severity varies widely between studies, with little data on its duration and recovery rate. Since this significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, there is a need for a study to provide insight into the loss of smell or taste in terms of its correlation with other upper respiratory tract symptoms, natural history and resolution rates., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 718 mild to moderately symptomatic adult patients (>= 18 years), admitted consecutively to Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Odisha, India between June 25 and July 24, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Prevalence, severity, duration and factors associated with altered smell or taste sensation, and their follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: Of the 718 patients included in the study at baseline [563 (78%) men; median age 34 years], 101 (14%) patients experienced either altered smell or taste, with 52 (7%) experiencing both altered smell and taste. Seventy-seven (10.7%) patients had altered smell and 76 patients had altered taste (10.5%). Of these, 71 (92%) and 73 (96%) regained their sense of smell and taste, respectively, by 14 days after their swab tested positive. Presence of fever (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.7-10.6, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = 0.009) and nasal obstruction (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4-6.7, p = 0.006) were independently associated with increased likelihood of experiencing both altered taste and smell in multivariable models., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of altered smell and taste in Indians was much lower compared to Europeans and similar to East Asians. Majority regained these senses by 2 weeks. Identification of these symptoms can help in early detection of the disease in suspected individuals.	false
0	COVID-19 molecular level laboratory diagnoses. AbstractAIMS: Aims: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused not only global pandemic, but it also pointed at unprepared health care systems and countermeasures were introduced under the pressure of urgent circumstances. This review is focused on discussion and critical evaluation of instrumental tools for COVID-19 diagnosis that were developed in the last months., METHODS: Survey of actual literature and scientific reports was made. The most substantial analytical and diagnostical methods were identified and described. Principles and limitations of the methods are described, and actual papers are cited in this review., RESULTS: Analytical and diagnostical methods like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Lateral Flow Immunochromatography Assay (LFIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), biosensors and ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA) are discussed for assay of viral particles, antigens and specific host antibodies in blood, serum, plasma, nasopharyngeal swab and other samples in order to diagnose COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has spread over the world since the end of year 2019. The global epidemic pointed at the necessity to introduce sensitive methods for instrumental diagnosis of COVID-19 and distinguishing it from the other viral diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 96).	false
0	Adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and diabetes: a retrospective cohort study from three London teaching hospitals. INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have poorer outcomes. However, the drivers of poorer outcomes are not fully elucidated. We performed detailed characterization of patients with COVID-19 to determine the clinical and biochemical factors that may be drivers of poorer outcomes., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 889 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 9 and April 22, 2020 in a large London National Health Service Trust. Unbiased multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of death and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis., RESULTS: 62% of patients in our cohort were of non-white ethnic background and the prevalence of diabetes was 38%. 323 (36%) patients met the primary outcome of death/admission to the ICU within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, lower platelet count, advancing age and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (but not diabetes) independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission. Factors that were significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were coexisting ischemic heart disease, increasing age and lower platelet count., CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of a diverse patient population, comorbidity (ie, diabetes with ischemic heart disease; increasing CFS score in older patients) was a major determinant of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Antiplatelet medication should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials among high-risk patient groups. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

0	COVID-19: The First 30 Days at a UK Level 1 Trauma Centre and Lessons Learnt. Aims To analyse the learning points from the first 30 days of the COVID-19 lockdown at our institution. Patients & methods Following ethical approval, data were collected prospectively on all patients admitted under orthopaedics between March 23, 2020, and April 22, 2020. This included baseline demographics (sex, age), biochemical (blood tests), radiological (chest X-ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT)), nature and mechanism of injury, comorbidities, regular medication, observations, specific respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, management, operations, time to theatre, and outcome including mortality incidence. The nature of injury and operations performed were compared to the same period of the previous year (2019). Results During the study period, 162 (74 males) patients were admitted, with a mean age of 60.7 (range 1-101, SD 2.1). On admission, 66 (41%) patients were tested for COVID, out of which eight (13.7%) patients tested positive. Subsequently, another four patients tested positive, who developed symptoms after admission. Four out 12 (33%) confirmed COVID patients died. During this period, 4/150 other patients also died of other causes (mortality incidence 2.6%). The average ages of COVID non-survivors vs survivors were 88, SD 1, vs 76, SD 12, respectively; 2/4 had concurrent diabetes and cancer, another cancer alone, and another complex autoimmune disease managed by immunosuppressive medication. Overall admissions significantly reduced by almost 50% compared with the previous year (162 vs 373, p=<0.05), including cases of polytrauma (15 vs 33). Time to surgery was increased by an average of one day, mainly due to time taken for COVID-19 swab results to come back, and in positive patients, this was an average of 2.75 days (0-13). Lymphopenia was a useful biomarker of COVID, with levels significantly different between groups (p=<0.05). Of the clinical symptoms assessed, 8/12 patients experienced positive chest symptoms or pyrexia but only four had positive CXR changes. Discussion & lessons learnt Eight out of 12 patients who contracted COVID-19 survived without needing intensive care. Non-survivors were older with significant comorbidities. Lymphopenia is a good biomarker of the disease, but suspicious CXR was not sensitive for excluding it. Trauma volume reduced. We have highlighted significant changes to expect should there be a second wave of the virus. Key lessons learnt were that reduction in trauma volume and cessation of elective operating allowed for redeployment, including taking over the minor injury unit; more senior, consultant decision-makers 'at the front door' reduced unnecessary admissions. Increased use of conservative practice was effective at reducing operations required. Expedited COVID swab test processing allowed early de-escalation of isolation, reducing time to surgery. We expect approximately 12% of the typical orthopaedic population to be admitted with COVID, and up to 33% of these patients to die within 28 days of contracting the virus. The vast majority of patients, however, can be managed appropriately with ward-level care. An early decision on escalation and resuscitation status in the emergency department improves patient flow significantly. Remote working was effective and could be extended in the future. We have highlighted the significant changes to expect should there be a second wave of the virus and effective solutions for managing the problems that arise, which could be useful for other units.

0	"Evaluating the Onset, Severity, and Recovery of Changes to Smell and Taste Associated With COVID-19 Infection in a Singaporean Population (the COVOSMIA-19 Trial): Protocol for a Prospective Case-Control Study. BACKGROUND: Sudden loss of smell and/or taste has been suggested to be an early marker of COVID-19 infection, with most findings based on self-reporting of sensory changes at a single time point., OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days., METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (""swab test""). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software., RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited., CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04492904; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04492904., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/24797.

0	COVID-19, leprosy, and neutrophils. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has only recently emerged, while Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, has endured for more than 2,000 years. As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology.	false
0	Impact of a shelter-in-place order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdoses. INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, there have been concerns about the potential impact of the pandemic on persons with opioid use disorder. Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order., METHODS: A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100 days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100 days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test., RESULTS: Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a p < 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29)., CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated SIP order were associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in the proportion of opioid overdoses in relation to the overall change in total ED visits.

0	Sharp increase in depression and anxiety among Brazilian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the PAMPA cohort. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms before and during the pandemic and identify factors associated with aggravated mental health symptoms., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., METHODS: We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale., RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June-July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18-30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders., CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. Public policies such as physical activity promotion and strategies to reduce the economic strain caused by this pandemic are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.

0	Depression, anxiety symptoms, Insomnia, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic period among individuals living with disabilities in Ethiopia, 2020. BACKGROUND: People with disabilities face multiple barriers that prevent them from accessing care and essential information related to the COVID-19 pandemic that poses additional stress and psychopathology. Therefore, the investigation of psychopathologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and emergency response is critical., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 scale, insomnia severity index-7, and brief resilient coping scale were administered to participants. The collected data was then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical procedures were employed to describe the various psychopathologies. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value <0.05 was declared as statistically significant., RESULTS: A significant proportion of individuals living with disability had psychopathologies; 46.2% for depression symptoms, 48.1% for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and 71% for insomnia symptoms. Nearly 45.7% of participants were low resilient copers to their psychopathology. Depression was significantly higher in divorced/widowed/separated (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.28-8.92, P-value = 0.006), non-educated (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.90, P-value = 0.001), and unemployed (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.11, P-value = 0.005) as well as a daily laborer (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.20, 4.89, P-value = 0.014) subjects. Generalized anxiety disorder was also significantly higher in young age (<40 years) (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.98, P-value = 0.02), single (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.3, P-value = 0.011), widowed/divorced/separated (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.78, P-value = 0.032), preparatory school completed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.46, P-value = 0.001), daily laborer (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.23, P-value = 0.003), and unemployed (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.78, P-value = 0.005) participants. Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, P-value = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), unemployed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.03, P-value = 0.001), blind (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.42, 6.35, P-value = 0.001), and deaf (AOR = 10.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 35.33, P-value = 0.002) participants., CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent among individuals with a disability during the COVID-19 period. Multiple sociodemographic and disability-related factors were associated with this high psychopathology. Attention has to be given by the government and other stakeholders to intervene in psychopathology and its associated factors.	false
0	Safety in Digestive Endoscopy during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We read with interest the study by Hernandez-Camba et al. (1) about the little value found in antibody testing for Covid-19 before endoscopic procedures and we would like to make some comments Nine months after the first state of alarm was declared in Spain due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, we know that infections in endoscopy staff are scarce if adequate protection is worn and non-urgent procedures are postponed in patients with active infection. Therefore, the conclusions of the study appear to be, currently, self-evident. However, things were different at the time it was done. The study was performed during endoscopic activity resumption, after almost a full stop of most non-urgent endoscopic procedures. Furthemore, at that time, PCR tests on nasopharyngeal exudate were not widely available.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 and Rohingya Refugee Camp, Bangladesh: Uncertainty and How the Government Took Over the Situation. {\bf Abstract.} \\ {\bf Background:} Bangladesh hosts more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. The low health immunity, lifestyle, access to good healthcare services, social-security cause this population to be at risk of far more direct effects of COVID-19 than the host population. Therefore, evidence-based forecasting of the COVID-19 burden is vital in this regard. In this study, we aimed to forecast the COVID-19 burden among the Rohingya refugees of Bangladesh to keep up with the disease outbreak's pace, health needs, and disaster preparedness. \noindent{\bf Methodology and Findings:} To estimate the possible consequences of COVID-19 in the Rohingya camps of Bangladesh, we used a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model. All the values of different parameters used in this model were from the Bangladesh Government&rsquo;s database and the relevant emerging literature. We addressed two different scenarios, i.e., the best-fitting model and good fitting model with unique consequences of COVID-19. Our best fitting model suggests that there will be good control over the transmission of the COVID-19 disease. At the end of December 2020, there will be only 169 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Rohingya refugee camps. The average basic reproduction number ($ \mathcal{R}_{0} $) has been estimated to be 0.7563. \noindent{\bf Conclusion:} Our analysis suggests that, due to the extensive precautions from the Bangladesh government as well as other humanitarian organizations, the coronavirus disease will be under control if the maintenance continues like this. Although detailed and pragmatic preparedness should be adopted for the worst scenario.	false
0	Stages of COVID-19 pandemic and paths to herd immunity by vaccination: dynamical model comparing Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden. <h4>Background</h4> Worldwide more than 72 million people have been infected and 1.6 million died with SARS-CoV-2 by 15th December 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions which decrease social interaction have been implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to mitigate stress on healthcare systems and prevent deaths. The pandemic has been tackled with disparate strategies by distinct countries resulting in different epidemic dynamics. However, with vaccines now becoming available, the current urgent open question is how the interplay between vaccination strategies and social interaction will shape the pandemic in the next months. <h4>Methods</h4> To address this question, we developed an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including social interaction, undetected cases and the progression of patients trough hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) and death. We calibrated our model to data of Luxem-bourg, Austria and Sweden, until 15th December 2020. We incorporated the effect of vaccination to investigate under which conditions herd immunity would be achievable in 2021. <h4>Results</h4> The model reveals that Sweden has the highest fraction of undetected cases, Luxembourg displays the highest fraction of infected population, and all three countries are far from herd immunity as of December 2020. The model quantifies the level of social interactions, and allows to assess the level which would keep R eff ( t ) below 1. In December 2020, this level is around 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic for all the three countries. The model allows to estimate the vaccination rate needed for herd immunity and shows that 2700 vaccinations/day are needed in Luxembourg to reach it by mid of April and 45,000 for Austria and Sweden. The model estimates that vaccinating the whole country’s population within 1 year could lead to herd immunity by July in Luxembourg and by August in Austria and Sweden. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The model allows to shed light on the dynamics of the epidemics in different waves and countries. Our results emphasize that vaccination will help considerably but not immediately and therefore social measures will remain important for several months before they can be fully alleviated.	false
0	Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers and the General Population During the COVID-19 in Italy. Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers in Italy have been exposed to an unprecedented pressure and traumatic events. However, no direct comparison with the general population is available so far. The aim of this study is to detail mental health outcomes in healthcare workers compared to the general population., Methods: 24050 respondents completed an on-line questionnaire during the contagion peak, 21342 general population, 1295 second-line healthcare workers, and 1411 front-line healthcare workers. Depressive, anxious, post-traumatic symptoms and insomnia were assessed. Specific COVID-19 related potential risk factors were also considered in healthcare workers., Results: Depressive symptoms were more frequent in the general population (28.12%) and front-line healthcare workers (28.35%) compared to the second-line healthcare workers (19.98%) groups. Anxiety symptoms showed a prevalence of 21.25% in the general population, 18.05% for second-line healthcare workers, and 20.55% for front-line healthcare workers. Insomnia showed a prevalence of 7.82, 6.58, and 9.92% for the general population, second-line healthcare workers, and front-line healthcare workers, respectively. Compared to the general population, front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing total trauma-related symptoms. Both second-line healthcare workers and front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing core post-traumatic symptoms compared to the general population, while second-line healthcare workers had lower odds of endorsing negative affect and dissociative symptoms. Higher total traumatic symptom score was associated with being a front-line healthcare worker, having a colleague infected, hospitalized, or deceased, being a nurse, female gender, and younger age., Conclusion: This study suggests a significant psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian general population and healthcare workers. Front-line healthcare workers represent a specific at-risk population for post-traumatic symptoms. These findings underline the importance of monitoring and intervention strategies.

The pathogen burden, defined by the frequency of antibodies to several viruses and a parasite, is greater in Hispanic whites and black populations than it is in non-Hispanic whites, in the USA. The poor and those without higher education also have higher pathogen burdens. The most frequent pathogen that was measured, was the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This virus can inactivate most of the elements in the immune system, that are designed to protect against the incursions of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. HSV-1 can also damage the blood brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the entry of pathogens into the central nervous system. Without the help of HSV-1, the COVID-19 virus may not be able to cause serious illness or death in humans. A prophylactic treatment to contain HSV-1, could be vital in the fight against COVID-19.

0	Anti-PEG scFv corona ameliorates accelerated blood clearance phenomenon of PEGylated nanomedicines. Anti-PEG antibodies have been witnessed in patients and experimental animals, accelerating the blood clearance (termed ABC phenomenon) of PEGylated nanomedicines by activating complement after absorption on the nano-surface. The ABC phenomenon presents an obstacle to the clinical translation of PEGylated nanomedicines. Herein, an anti-PEG single-chain variable fragment (PEG-scFv) that possesses a low molecule weight (30 kDa) and high PEG binding affinity was exploited to ameliorate the ABC phenomenon of PEGylated liposomes (sLip). Pre-deposition of PEG-scFv on the surface of sLip was incompetent to activate complement due to the lack of Fc chains, exhibiting negligible influence on in vivo performance of sLip in naive rats (without anti-PEG antibodies). However, PEG-scFv effectively competed the binding of anti-PEG IgM in rats that were pre-stimulated with low dose of sLip, thus ameliorated the ABC phenomenon of sLip. PEG- scFv was also effective to inhibit the binding of anti-PEG antibodies with sLip in human plasma and the consequent complement activation, presenting a promising tool to improve the performance of PEGylated nanomedicines and to mitigate individual difference occurred by the varying levels of anti-PEG antibodies in the clinic. The application of anti-PEG scFv paves a new avenue for the development of nanocarriers to achieve precise medication. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	[Rt or RDt, that is the question!]. The article compares two of the most followed indices in the monitoring of COVID-19 epidemic cases: the Rt and the RDt indices. The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions. The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population. The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects. The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944). The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.	false
0	Intimate Partner Violence Against Pregnant Jordanian Women at the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic's Quarantine. In Jordan, women experience considerable levels of different types of violence. The emerging data from different countries indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) has intensified since the COVID-19 outbreak. The main purpose of the current study is to find out whether there is any difference in the incidence of IPV during and before the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and whether any sociodemographical factors are related to the incidence of IPV against pregnant women during quarantine. A cross-sectional, correlational design was in this study. The snowball sampling technique was adopted to select the participants, which produced a nonrepresentative sample of 215 pregnant women. The participants completed the Arabic version of the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire Screening Tool (DVQST). We found that women were exposed to different types of IPV before and during the quarantine. The most prevalent form of IPV was control and humiliation (n 172, 80%) and the least prevalent was sexual violence ((n 33, 15.3%), (n 24, 11.2%), respectively). However, there were statistically significant lower DVQST scores during the COVID-19 quarantine than before the quarantine. All types of IPV are significantly correlated with each other and with relationship problems (marital conflict, verbal fighting, understanding each other). While the findings are not generalizable to the general population of pregnant women in Jordan because the sample consisted only of women of high socioeconomic status due to the use of a nonprobability sampling technique, national campaigns should be developed and implemented in order to reduce IPV and change community behaviors and attitudes toward violence against women. It is also recommended that policymakers develop plans to help pregnant women during quarantine by, for example, training care providers on how to access vulnerable women.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control Adherence in Long-Term Care Facilities, Atlanta, Georgia. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Recommendations for infection prevention and control (IPC) of COVID-19 in long-term care settings were developed based on limited understanding of COVID-19 and should be evaluated to determine their efficacy in reducing transmission among high-risk populations., DESIGN AND SETTING: Site visits to 24 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Fulton County, Georgia, were conducted between June and July 2020 to assess adherence to current guidelines, provide real-time feedback on potential weaknesses, and identify specific indicators whose implementation or lack thereof was associated with higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19., PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four LTCFs were visited, representing 2,580 LTCF residents, among whom 1,004 (39%) were infected with COVID-19., MEASUREMENTS: Overall IPC adherence in LTCFs was analyzed for 33 key indicators across five categories: Hand Hygiene, Disinfection, Social Distancing, PPE, and Symptom Screening. Facilities were divided into Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups based on cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence to determine differences in IPC implementation., RESULTS: IPC implementation was lowest in the Disinfection category (32%) and highest in the Symptom Screening category (74%). Significant differences in IPC implementation between the Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups were observed in the Social Distancing category (Higher-prevalence group 54% vs Lower-prevalence group 74%, P < .01) and the PPE category (Higher-prevalence group 41% vs Lower-prevalence group 72%, P < .01)., CONCLUSION: LTCFs with lower COVID-19 prevalence among residents had significantly greater implementation of IPC recommendations compared to those with higher COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting the utility in adhering to current guidelines to reduce transmission in this vulnerable population.

0	A Comprehensive Review of Coronavirus Disease 2019: Epidemiology, Transmission, Risk Factors, and International Responses. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide pandemic. The first reports of patients with COVID-19 were provided to World Health Organization on December 21, 2019 and were presumably associated with seafood markets in Wuhan, China. As of October 25, 2020, more than 42 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 1.1 million deaths. Asymptomatic transmission contributes significantly to transmission, and clinical features are non-specific to the disease. Thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires specific viral RNA testing. The disease demonstrates extensive human-to-human transmissibility and has infected healthcare workers at high rates. Clinical awareness of the epidemiology and the risk factors for nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 is essential to preventing infection. Moreover, effective control measures should be further identified by comprehensive evaluation of hospital and community responses. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, presentation, transmission, risk factors, and public health measures associated with COVID-19. We also review past insights from previous coronavirus epidemics [i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)] to suggest measures to reduce transmission. © Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2021.	false
0	Early Psychiatric Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the General Population and Healthcare Workers in Italy: A Preliminary Study. Introduction: Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread to several countries worldwide, including Italy. In this study, we aimed to assess the psychopathological impact of the pandemic across the general population of Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, and to compare the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms between the general public and healthcare workers. Methods: Four hundred and thirty-two participants completed an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI). Healthcare workers were also asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results: At the DASS-21, 33.3% of the responders presented pathological levels of stress, 25.5% of anxiety, and 35.9% of depression. At the IES-R, 13.9% appeared at risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the PSQI, 57.6% presented sleep disturbances. Female gender and younger age predicted higher scores of distress. Healthcare workers presented higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the general public. Moreover, working in contact with COVID-19 patients predicted higher scores at the IES-R subscale Intrusion. Conclusion:  Our results showed that about a third of our sample presented symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Lombardy; more than half of the responders presented sleep disturbances, and 13% appeared at risk of PTSD. Italian authorities should develop specific strategies to guarantee psychological support to the population of Lombardy, with particular attention to women, young people, and healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients.

0	Acute Ischemic Stroke in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2: Neurorehabilitation Implications of Inflammation Induced Immunological Responses Affecting Vascular Systems. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses and have been shown to cause mild to severe respiratory infections in humans, with some severe cases inducing neurological manifestations. The lethality and Neurological effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and recently the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been well documented though currently there is little literature regarding long term effects and the implications for neurorehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV have been linked to the infection associated inflammatory cytokine storms and induced hypercoagulopathic states that affect the entire vascular system including that of the brain. This mini-review provides an overview of the commonalities among studies published on all three types of the coronavirus related to acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The aim was to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underpinning COVID-2 and to reflect the similarities with the chronic inflammation induced symptoms of AIS that are likely to prove a further challenge for neurorehabilitation clinicians post COVID. In terms of increased incidence of COVID and AIS, it is likely that in depth knowledge of increased thrombotic risk in this population will require appropriate anticoagulation treatment, and other therapeutic interventions as well as neurorehabilitation interventions. Lastly the risk of spreading the virus requires further balancing of the provision of neurorehabiliatation services useful to the patient.

0	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and comparison with control patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. In a large-scale study, 128176 non-pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID-19 cases included in this Meta-Analysis. The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28-37) years old and 36 (34-37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID-19 as non-pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non-pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non-pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non-pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67-0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54-0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61-0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55-0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4-0.51) than non-pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground-glass opacity (57%) and in non-pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C-reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non-pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non-pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non-pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4-8.5), and mortality due to all-cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6-13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7-94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42-54]), preterm labor (25% [4-74]) and preterm birth (21% [12-34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2-5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4-30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5-3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID-19 than pregnant women without COVID-19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2-96]), fetal distress (30% [12-58]) and LBW (25% [16-37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3-16), and the rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 is 8% (4-16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible association between COVID-19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID-19 pregnant patients.

0	Comparative efficacy of respiratory personal protective equipment against viral respiratory infectious diseases in healthcare workers: a network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the healthcare workers (HCWs) require proper respiratory personal protective equipment (rPPE) against viral respiratory infectious diseases (VRIDs). It is necessary to evaluate which type of mask and manner of wearing is the best suitable rPPE for preventing the VRID., STUDY DESIGN: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively analyze the protective efficacy of various rPPE., METHODS: This network meta-analysis protocol was registered in an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020179489). Electronic databases were searched for cluster randomized control trials (RCTs) of comparing the effectiveness of rPPE and wearing manner in preventing HCWs from VRID. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% credibility interval (CrI). The secondary outcome was the incidence of clinical respiratory illness (CRI) reported as an OR with the associated 95% CrI. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) provided a ranking of each rPPE according to the primary outcome and the secondary outcome as data supplement., RESULTS: Six studies encompassing 12,265 HCWs were included. In terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection, the continuous wearing of N95 respirators (network OR, 0.48; 95% CrI: 0.27 to 0.86; SUCRA score, 85.4) showed more effective than the control group. However, in terms of reducing the incidence of CRI, there was no rPPE showing superior protective effectiveness., CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in preventive efficacy among current rPPE. Our result suggests that continuous wearing of N95 respirators on the whole shift can serve as the best preventive rPPE for HCWs from the VRID. Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Further, the level of natural immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully clear, nor is it clear if a primary infection is protective against reinfection. To investigate the potential association between serum antibody titers and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, ferrets with different levels of NAb titers after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection were subjected to reinfection with a heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strain. All heterologous SARS-CoV-2 reinfected ferrets showed active virus replication in the upper respiratory and gastro-intestinal tracts. However, the high NAb titer group showed attenuated viral replication and rapid viral clearance. In addition, direct-contact transmission was observed only from reinfected ferrets with low NAb titers (< 20), and not from other groups. Further, lung histopathology demonstrated the presence of limited inflammatory regions in the high NAb titer groups compared with control and low NAb groups. This study demonstrates a close correlation between a low NAb titer and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a recovered ferret reinfection model.	false
0	A longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients reveals a high correlation between neutralizing antibodies and COVID-19 severity. Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection against reinfection and, thus, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19. In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.	false
0	The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Healthcare Workers with Pre-Existing Psychiatric Conditions. Both healthcare workers (HCWs) and psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have elevated prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, but little is known about HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses. To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32 years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized beta = .51 for PCL and standardized beta = .55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized beta = .44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized beta = .53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others. There is a growing importance to protect HCWs mental health, including those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and proactively counter psychosocial consequences of healthcare crises.	false
0	Full Inequities in Diabetic Ketoacidosis among Patients with Type 1 diabetes and COVID-19: Data from 52 US Clinical Centers. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D) was more prevalent among Non-Hispanic (NH) Black and Hispanic patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 compared to NH Whites., METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study of patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 52 clinical sites in the US, data was collected April - August 2020. We examined the distribution of patient factors and DKA events across NH White, NH Black, and Hispanic race/ethnicity groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the odds of DKA among NH Black and Hispanic patients with T1D as compared to NH White patients, adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, sex, insurance, and last HbA1c., RESULTS: We included 180 patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the analysis. Forty-four percent (n=79) were NH White, 31% (n=55) NH Black, 26% (n=46) Hispanic. NH Blacks and Hispanics had higher median HbA1c than Whites ((%-points) [IQR]:11.7[4.7], p<0.001, and 9.7[3.1] vs. 8.3[2.4], p=0.01). We found that more NH Black and Hispanic presented with DKA compared to Whites (55% and 33% vs. 13%, p<0.001 and p=0.008, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounders, NH Black patients continued to have greater odds of presenting with DKA compared with NH Whites (OR [95%CI]: 3.7 [1.4,10.6])., CONCLUSION: We found that among T1D patients with COVID-19 infection, NH Blacks were more likely to present in DKA compared with NH White patients. Our findings demonstrate additional risk among NH Blacks with T1D and COVID-19. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society.

0	Acute urticaria preceding other COVID-19-associated manifestations-A case report. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a variety of dermatologic manifestations, often the predominant finding in otherwise asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients. Urticarial eruption is one example, but few cases have been reported among pediatric patients. We present a case of acute urticaria in a 6-month-old boy preceding other COVID-19 symptoms. The suspicion of a possible COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestation prompted timely testing and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	Right Heart Strain on Presenting 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Predicts Critical Illness in COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association of new right heart strain patterns on presenting 12-lead electrocardiogram (RHS-ECG) with outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited., METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V1 to V3 or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes., RESULTS: ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; p < 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95% CI: 3.4 to 23.2; p < 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95% CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: RHS-ECG was associated with mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. Special attention should be taken in patients admitted with new signs of RHS on presenting ECG. Copyright © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

0	Frequent neurocognitive deficits after recovery from mild COVID-19. Neuropsychiatric complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. While most studies have focussed on severely affected individuals during acute infection, it remains unclear whether mild COVID-19 results in neurocognitive deficits in young patients. Here, we established a screening approach to detect cognitive deficiencies in post-COVID-19 patients. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 18 mostly young patients 20-105 days (median, 85 days) after recovery from mild to moderate disease who visited our outpatient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. Notably, 14 (78%) patients reported sustained mild cognitive deficits and performed worse in the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status screening test for mild cognitive impairment compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls. While short-term memory, attention and concentration were particularly affected by COVID-19, screening results did not correlate with hospitalization, treatment, viremia or acute inflammation. Additionally, Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status scores did not correlate with depressed mood or fatigue. In two severely affected patients, we excluded structural or other inflammatory causes by magnetic resonance imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. Together, our results demonstrate that sustained sub-clinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults, regardless of clinical course that were unmasked by our diagnostic approach.

0	The Psychological Pressures of Breast Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China-A Comparison With Frontline Female Nurses. Objective: During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, breast cancer (BC) patients and healthcare workers faced several challenges, resulting in great psychological stress. We measured the psychological status of BC patients and female nurses and compared the severity within the two groups at the peak time-point of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 207 BC patients and 684 female nurses were recruited from Wuhan. They completed an anonymous questionnaire online using the most popular social media software in China, WeChat. The psychological status of BC patients and of female nurses was measured using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The differences between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The scores of BC patients and frontline female nurses for the four scales were significantly higher than those of non-frontline female nurses (P < 0.001). There were similar scores between BC patients and frontline female nurses for PHQ-9, GAD-7, and IES-R (P = 0.789, P = 0.101, P = 0.158, respectively). Notably, the scores of BC patients for ISI were significantly higher than those of the frontline female nurses (P = 0.016). A considerable proportion of BC patients reported symptoms of depression (106/207, 51.2%), anxiety (130/207, 62.8%), insomnia (106/207, 51.2%), and PTSD (73/207, 35.5%), which was more severe than that of female nurses. Conclusions: BC patients experienced great psychological pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incidents of symptomatic anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and PTSD were significantly comparable to that of frontline female nurses, and episodes of insomnia among BC participants were more serious than for frontline female nurses.

0	Mental Health of Flying Cabin Crews: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Objectives: Initially, we analyzed relations between the challenging working conditions of flight attendants with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. As the COVID-19 pandemic plunged airlines into an unprecedented crisis, its impact on the mental health of flying cabin crews became the focus of a second survey. Methods: Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (N = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (N = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). Results: Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of d = 0.63 for depression, d = 0.26 for anxiety, and d = 0.52 for stress. The incidence of clinically relevant symptoms among the respondents increased from 8 to 23% (depression), from 6 to 14% (anxiety), and from 8 to 24% (stress). Conclusion:  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated work restrictions coincide with severe impairment of mental health of flying cabin crews, consistent with a mental health protecting function of labor.

0	Depression and loneliness during April 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in the United States, and their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections. PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of depression and loneliness during the US COVID-19 response, and examine their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections., METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1010), aged 18-94, running from April 10-20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g., hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g., partnered sexual activity, dating app use)., RESULTS: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, aged 20-29, unmarried, and low-income. Very frequent in-person connections were generally associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not., CONCLUSIONS: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained very frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes. While COVID-19 social restrictions remain necessary, it will be critical to expand mental health services to serve those most at-risk and identify effective ways of maintaining social and sexual connections from a distance.	false
0	A rapid review of the pathoetiology, presentation, and management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested. Copyright © 2020.

0	Prevalence of liver injury and correlation with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: systematic review with meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Liver involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in several papers, but without homogeneous findings. We aimed to systematically review the prevalence of liver involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at their hospital admission, and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with or without pre-existing chronic liver disease., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, PMC, clinical trial registries, and other Coronavirus family publications for studies reporting data on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and liver function tests (LFTs) alterations, as well as clinical course of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Case reports, preprints, editorials, reviews were excluded. We also revised literature to describe the background of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection., RESULTS: 36 studies, including 20724 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included. The pooled prevalence of LFTs abnormalities at admission was 46.9% (AST 26.5%, ALT 22.8%, GGT 22.5%, ALP 5.7%, tBIL 8.0%). ALT, AST, tBIL were independent predictors of disease severity (ALT OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.03; AST OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.10-4.77; tBIL OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.18-4.58) and in-hospital mortality (ALT OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96; AST OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.68-7.18; tBIL OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.28-26.40). Heterogeneity among studies was high. The few available data also reported that COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis., CONCLUSIONS: LFTs alterations were reported in up to 47% of unselected patients with COVID-19 and were associated with severe disease or in-hospital mortality. In cirrhotic patients, COVID-19 was associated with high risk of liver decompensation or mortality.	false
0	"Secondary attack rates of COVID-19 in diverse contact settings, a meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: The secondary attack rate (SAR) measures the transmissibility of an infectious agent. The reported SAR of COVID-19 varied in a broad range, and between different contact settings., METHODOLOGY: We conducted a meta-analysis on the SAR of COVID-19 with adherence to the PRISMA guideline. We searched published literatures and preprints in international databases of PubMed and medRxiv, and in five major Chinese databases as of 20 April 2020, using the following search terms: (""COVID-19"" and ""secondary attack rate"") or (""COVID-19"" and ""close contact""). The random effect model was chosen for pooled analyses, using R (version 3.6.3)., RESULTS: A total of 1,136 references were retrieved and 18 of them remained after screening. The pooled SAR of COVID-19 was 0.07 (95%: 0.03-0.12) in general. It differed significantly between contact settings, peaking in households (0.20, 95%: 0.15-0.28), followed by in social gatherings (0.06, 95%: 0.03-0.10). The point estimates of the pooled SARs in health facilities, transports, and work/study settings were all as low as 0.01. Among all the secondary cases, the proportion of asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 0.17 (95% CI: 0.09 - 0.34). The proportion was higher in households (0.26, 95% CI: 0.12-0.56), than in other contact settings., CONCLUSIONS: The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher in households than in other scenarios. Identification of asymptomatic secondary infections should be enhanced in households. Copyright (c) 2020 Ting Tian, Xiang Huo."	false
0	Clinical features and laboratory characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19: single centre report from Egypt. INTRODUCTION: The recently discovered novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan, China, since January 2020. Egypt reported a low incidence of infection when compared with other countries. The aim of the study was to assess the characterization of COVID-19 infection among the Egyptian population., METHODOLOGY: Data were collected from a single COVID-19 quarantine hospital in Cairo. A total number of 195 cases were included with their clinical, laboratory, and radiological data., RESULTS: Three different age groups behaved differently for COVD-19 infection. The pediatric age group was asymptomatic entirely, the middle age group (18-50 years) were asymptomatic in 53.3% of cases, while 77.9% of those above 50 years were symptomatic (p <= 0.001). The latter group had a high incidence of COVID-pneumonia in (83.1%), and moderate to critical presentations were encountered in 66.3% of them. Neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio correlated directly with the age and case severity. C-reactive protein (CRP) and computed tomography scan chest (CT-chest) had added value on COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected cases., CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, patients above 50 years are at a higher risk for symptomatic COVID-19 infection and leaner for moderate to critical COVID-19 presentation. The triad of CT-chest, CRP, and N/L ratio could be an integrated panel for assessing disease severity.

0	Management protocol for emergency aneurysm craniotomy clipping in non-major COVID-19 epidemic areas in Beijing, China. BACKGROUND: An epidemic of COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. The ordinary medical services were hindered. However, the emergency cases, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), still required timely intervention. Thus, it provoked challenges to the routine management protocol. In this study, we summarized our experience in the emergency management of aSAH (Beijing Tiantan Protocol, BTP) in Beijing, China., METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and imaging data of consecutive emergency aSAH patients who underwent craniotomy clipping during the COVID-19 epidemic season were reviewed and compared with the retrospective period last year. Subgroup analysis was further performed to assess the outcomes of different screening results and several detailed protocols. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)., RESULTS: A total of 127 aSAH were referred to our emergency department, and 42 (33.1%) underwent craniotomy clipping between January 20, 2020, and March 25, 2020. The incidence of preoperative hospitalized adverse events and the perioperative outcomes were similar (- 0.1, 95% CI - 1.0 to 0.8, P = 0.779) to the retrospective period last year (January 2019-March 2019). After the propensity score matching (PSM), there were still no statistical differences in prognostic parameters between the two groups. Eight (19.0%) of the 42 individuals were initially screened as preliminary undetermined COVID-19 cases, in which 2 of them underwent craniotomy clipping in the negative pressure operating room (OR). The prognosis of patients with varied COVID-19 screening results was similar (F(2, 39) = 0.393, P = 0.678). Since February 28, 12 cases (28.6%) received COVID-19 nucleic acid testing (NAT) upon admission, and all showed negative. The false-negative rate was 0.0%. The preoperative hospitalized adverse events and postoperative prognosis were still similar between patients with and without COVID-19 NAT (- 0.3, 95% CI - 1.4 to 0.9, P = 0.653)., CONCLUSIONS: Our emergency surgery management protocol (BTP) is reliable for scheduling emergency aneurysm craniotomy clipping in non-major epidemic areas.	false
0	Long-term application of hydroxychloroquine could not prevent the infection of COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Current pandemic of the coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an urgent issue to the world due to lack of vaccine and medication. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has generated a lot of controversies whether it is effective in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Current report presents a 63-year-old woman who has taken HCQ for many years but still infected by COVID-19., CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with rheumatoid arthritis came to the clinic with fever and sore throat. The patient has been treated with 200 mg HCQ per day since 2016. Laboratory tests showed that the patient had lymphopenia, increased levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Chest radiography showed that the patient had pneumonia. Throat swab test confirmed COVID-19 positive. On admission, she was treated with nebulized interferon alfa-2b, oral Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and ceftriaxone sodium for the COVID-19 in addition to HCQ. The patient stayed in hospital for 18 days, recovered from oxygen intake, and eventually discharged from hospital. Follow up investigation showed the patient developed antibody against COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term application of HCQ could not prevent COVID-19 infection, but whether HCQ exerts benefit to alleviation of clinical symptoms and duration of hospital stays remains to be further investigated.

0	"Uncontrolled Innate and Impaired Adaptive Immune Responses in Patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Rationale: Uncontrolled inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive immune response are associated with clinical severity in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective(s): To compare the immunopathology of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with that of non-COVID-19 ARDS, and to identify biomarkers associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Method(s): Prospective observational monocenter study. Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020, were included and compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was mortality at Day 28. Flow cytometry analyses and serum cytokine measurements were performed at Days 1-2 and 4-6 of ICU admission. Measurements and Main Results: As compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS (n = 36), those with COVID-19 (n = 38) were not significantly different regarding age, sex, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores but exhibited a higher Day-28 mortality (34% vs. 11%, P = 0.030). Patients with COVID-19 showed profound and sustained T CD41 (P = 0.002), CD81 (P, 0.0001), and B (P, 0.0001) lymphopenia, higher HLA-DR expression on monocytes (P, 0.001) and higher serum concentrations of EGF (epithelial growth factor), GM-CSF, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1a, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES, and CCL20/MIP-3a. After adjusting on age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, serum CXCL10/IP-10 (P = 0.047) and GM-CSF (P = 0.050) were higher and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR cycle threshold values lower (P = 0.010) in patients with COVID-19 who were dead at Day 28. Conclusion(s): Profound global lymphopenia and a ""chemokine signature"" were observed in COVID-19 ARDS. Increased serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 and GM-CSF, together with higher nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, were associated with Day-28 mortality.Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society"	false

0	A serological aptamer-assisted proximity ligation assay for COVID-19 diagnosis and seeking neutralizing aptamers. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 plays an essential role in the current epidemic prevention and control. Despite the promise of nucleic acid and antibody tests, there is still a great challenge to reduce the misdiagnosis, especially for asymptomatic individuals. Here we report a generalizable method for highly specific and ultrasensitive detection of serum COVID-19-associated antigens based on an aptamer-assisted proximity ligation assay. The sensor is based on binding two aptamer probes to the same protein target that brings the ligation DNA region into close proximity, thereby initiating ligation-dependent qPCR amplification. Using this system, serum nucleocapsid protein has been detected quantitatively by converting protein recognition into a detectable qPCR signal using a simple, homogeneous and fast detection workflow in similar to 2 hours. In addition, this system has also been transformed into a universal platform for measuring specific interactions between spike S1 and its receptor ACE2, and more importantly demonstrated the feasibility for screening and investigation of potential neutralizing aptamers. Since in vitro selection can obtain aptamers selective for many COVID-19-associated antigens, the method demonstrated here will serve as an important tool for the diagnosis and therapeutics of COVID-19.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 and Plasmodium falciparum common immunodominant regions may explain low COVID-19 incidence in the malaria-endemic belt. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant morbidity and mortality and new cases are on the rise globally, yet malaria-endemic areas report statistically significant lower incidences. We identified potential shared targets for an immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by immune determinants' shared identities with P. falciparum using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource Immune 9.0 browser tool. Probable cross-reactivity is suggested through HLA-A*02:01 and subsequent CD8+ T-cell activation. The apparent immunodominant epitope conservation between SARS-CoV-2 (N and open reading frame (ORF) 1ab) and P. falciparum thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) may underlie the low COVID-19 incidence in the malaria-endemic zone by providing immunity against virus infection to those previously infected with Plasmodium. Additionally, we hypothesize that the shared epitopes which lie within antigens that aid in the establishment of the P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion may be an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2 via the erythrocyte CD147 receptor, although this remains to be proven.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 is similar to pneumonias of other origin: results from a multicentre study. Aims: COVID-19, a respiratory viral disease causing severe pneumonia, also affects the heart and other organs. Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. Methods and Results: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6] was indifferent, d-dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID-19 = 23.7% vs. non-COVID-19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID-19 = 17.1% vs. non-COVID-19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. Conclusion(s): Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID-19. While mortality was also similar, COVID-19 is characterized with increased thrombogenicity and high pulmonary embolism rates.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Real-life validation of the PanbioTM COVID-19 antigen rapid test (Abbott) in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Background: RT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 min and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined. Method(s): The diagnostic value of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs. Finding(s): 1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n = 139) and 30.3% (n = 63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in Utrecht and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2-99.95%) in Aruba. Interpretation(s): In community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct-values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Thromboelastography profile of patients with covid-19 admitted to intensive care unit: A single-center retrospective study from india. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes thromboinflammation resulting in a high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, which occur in significant numbers despite giving standard thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparins. Various markers and tests have been evaluated and found to have a strong association with the worse prognosis of the disease. Common coagulation markers like D-dimer and fibrinogen give more of a static picture of coagulation, whereas viscoelastic tests like thromboelastography (TEG) provide an understanding of the coagulation function and help in better interpretation. We conducted a retrospective analysis of TEG values of 32 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hypercoagulation as defined by TEG-coagulation index (CI) higher than the upper limit of the normal reference range (NRR) is found in 62.5% of the patients. There is also a clear representation of hypercoagulability as reflected by TEG-R, TEG-K, and TEG-LY30 values lower than or toward the lower limit of NRR, and TEG-ANGLE, TEG-MA, and TEG-CI values higher than or toward the upper limit of NRR which is more pronounced in severe forms of the disease, both in comparison to NRRs and other non-COVID ICU patients. Findings are similar to that of earlier studies in patients with COVID-19 except for the LY30, which is retained in the majority of our patients. Thromboelastography can be a useful tool to understand and screen for COVID-19-related hypercoagulability and may help predict VTE events. The potential of TEG to determine the optimal anticoagulant therapy needs to be evaluated in larger prospective studies.Copyright © The Author(s).	false
0	COVID-19 and pregnancy: Case series with diabetes co-morbidity from the registry study 'Covid-19 Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study' (CRONOS). From March 3 to October 13, 2020, 27 cases with diabetes comorbidity have been recorded in the CRONOS registry (Covid-19 Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study in Germany) among 262 registered women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their pregnancy. Of those, 21 presented with gestational diabetes, 5 with type 2 diabetes and 1 with type 1 diabetes. About half of the women were asymptomatic and were diagnosed via general screening at hospital admission. The most common symptoms were nasal congestion, cough, tiredness, malaise and changes in smell and taste. The majority of pregnant women showed a mild to moderate course, three women were admitted to the intensive care unit and none required invasive ventilation. In the type 2 diabetes group, there were two cases with late fetal death (37 and 40 weeks of gestation) and one with a malformation, an association with diabetes being most likely. Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus represent a special subgroup; 1 in 10 women in this small cohort required intensive care monitoring due to COVID-19. In addition, this case series underscores the need for unrestricted access to pregnancy care, especially in times of pandemic, for optimal perinatal outcome.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	false

0	Living with coronavirus! can the immunoglobulin report (Immunity certificate) help?. In December 2019 from Wuhan, China, a respiratory disease emerged and soon spread to different parts of the world. It was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and a pandemic on 30 January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The available test usually measures the binding antibodies and not neutralizing antibodies (NAB); therefore, we could not be sure whether these antibodies will protect against re-infection or not. However, in many viral diseases, total antibody responses usually correlate with NAB and we may consider it to be the same. Considering the huge economic impact the pandemic has and a successful vaccine seems distant in the near future, the world needs to learn to live with corona, as the impact of joblessness, economic recession, and hunger will kill more than the virus itself.Copyright © 2020, Bahrain Medical Bulletin.

0	COVID-19 health crisis and prevalence of anxiety among individuals of various age groups: a qualitative study. Purpose The monetary and psycho-social ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic have been extensive and unimaginable around the globe. The purpose of this study was to have a psycho-social analysis of people confronting this situation and its impact in the situation of a health crisis on them. Design/methodology/approach In the current study, participants were divided according to their different backgrounds and professions based on the types of measures taken by the Pakistani government to limit the spread of the virus and people who are not disturbed by any of the measurement categories but are troubled by the coronavirus. The interviews based on five open-ended questions were conducted with the eight participants, comprising questions that helped participants in remembering and realizing the purpose of the interview in the mode of an open questioning. Phenomenological interpretative analysis was used to understand how participants make meaning of the phenomenon being studied, an in-depth analysis of the human subject was considered in its singularity, and personal accounts and experiences were noted regarding this pandemic. Findings The results indicated that the participant's experiences were marked by stress, insecurity, anger, fear, anxiety, traces of painful emotions and a feeling of weakness. Also the prevalence of unknown precariousness and vulnerability of coronavirus aggravated the psychological frailness among people existing in an anxiety-prone situation created by the novel coronavirus. Confronted with these painful experiences, the participants however, used a variety of cognitive and behavioral efforts which needs to be strengthened by psychological care. Research limitations/implications This study based on qualitative method was performed on diverse socio-professional levels, giving an insight to what they are undergoing, their current fears, desires and their feeling. The outcome of this study reveals traces of uncertainty, anxiety, fears, insecurity and hidden imminent death from coronavirus, therefore highlighting a need for immediate psychological interventions. Originality/value This study explores the individual understanding regarding current coronavirus pandemic situation on subjective lived experiences and psychological health in an anxiety-prone context manifested by the health crisis created by the novel corona virus.	false
0	Mucin signature as a potential tool to predict susceptibility to COVID-19. The Corona Virus Infectious Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has played havoc on both the global health and economy. It is necessary to find a molecular signature that differentiates between low-risk and high-risk individuals. Pathogens, including viruses of the upper respiratory tract, utilize mucin proteins to enter into host cells. Mucins are critical components of innate immunity and also play important roles in infectious disease progression. Their expression is regulated by different cytokines during infection and inflammation. A comparison of mucin signatures between an asymptomatic versus symptomatic and between patients with mild versus severe symptoms could help identify other important proteins involved in the pathology of this new virus. Recent studies on the pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 have found receptors that help its entry into the cells. In this review, we present an overview of how mucins are connected to the pathogenicity of the virus and propose that studying the glycome and mucin signature may lead to the development of a biomarker in predicting the susceptibility, progression, and response to therapy in COVID-19 patients.

0	Thyroid Hormone Changes in Early Pregnancy Along With the COVID-19 Pandemic. Purpose: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) was first reported in December 2019 and quickly swept across China and around the world. Levels of anxiety and depression were increased among pregnant women during this infectious pandemic. Thyroid function is altered during stressful experiences, and any abnormality during early pregnancy may significantly affect fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic induces thyroid hormone changes in early pregnant women., Methods: This study comprised two groups of pregnant women in Shanghai in their first trimester - those pregnant women before the COVID-19 outbreak from January 20, 2019, to March 31, 2019 (Group 1) and those pregnant during the COVID-19 outbreak from January 20, 2020, to March 31, 2020 (Group 2). All women were included if they had early pregnancy thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody or thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) available and did not have a history of thyroid diseases or received thyroid treatment before or during pregnancy. We used propensity score matching to form a cohort in which patients had similar baseline characteristics., Results: Among 3338 eligible pregnant women, 727 women in Group 1 and 727 in Group 2 had similar propensity scores and were included in the analyses. Pregnant women in Group 2 had significantly higher FT3 (5.7 vs. 5.2 pmol/L, P<0.001) and lower FT4 (12.8 vs. 13.2 pmol/L, P<0.001) concentrations compared with those in Group 1. Pregnant women in Group 2 were more likely to develop isolated hypothyroxinemia (11.6% vs. 6.9%, OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.20-2.53], P=0.003) than those in Group 1 but had a significantly lower risk of TgAb positivity (12.0% vs. 19.0%, OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.43-0.78], P<0.001)., Conclusion: Pregnant women in their first trimester in Shanghai during the COVID-19 outbreak were at an increased risk of having higher FT3 concentrations, lower FT4 concentrations, and isolated hypothyroxinemia. The association between thyroid hormones, pregnancy outcomes, and the COVID-19 outbreak should be explored further. Copyright © 2020 Lin, Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Chen, Dennis, Huang and Wu.	false
0	Misleading Diagnosis of Radiological Imaging of COVID-19 Pneumonia During Pandemic Era: Risk on the Existence of CMV Infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease which rapidly disseminated due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Clinical presentations of COVID-19 are fever, non-productive cough, and dyspnea. Although the diagnosis establishment is done by detecting the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, CT scan has an important role in detection and treatment of COVID-19 especially in high prevalence regions. Chest CT scan has high sensitivity yet low specificity because there are a lot of other pathological spectrums that also present features of COVID-19 such as ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation, one of them is CMV infection. The objective of this case report is to raise vigilance towards other diseases that have radiological image similarities with COVID-19, especially in the immunocompromised patients who are susceptible to viral infections like CMV infection so that the delay in the disease treatment can be prevented.	false
0	Correlation Between Adult Tobacco Smoking Prevalence and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease-19 Across the World. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide. Limited studies showed that smokers were at higher risk of having severe complications and higher mortality. We aimed to analyze the possible correlation between adult tobacco smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality all over the world., METHODS: this correlation study involved a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020., RESULTS: seventy-five countries included with median CFR 3.66%. There was no relationship between adult male or female smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence, respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there was a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the mortality of COVID-19. Each increment of one percentage of adult male smoking prevalence was associated with increase in COVID-19 CFR by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041)., CONCLUSION: there is correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening of tobacco control policies is essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC. This still warrants further studies.	false
0	Targeting B cells to modify MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD: Part 2. Ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, inebilizumab, and evobrutinib are immunotherapies that target various B cell-related proteins. Most of these treatments have proven efficacy in relapsing and progressive forms of MS and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) or are in advanced stages of clinical development. Currently, ocrelizumab and inebilizumab are licensed for treatment of MS and NMOSD, respectively. This part of the review focuses on monoclonal antibody B cell-depleting strategies in NMOSD and the emerging related myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunoglobulin G-associated disease (MOGAD). Case series and phase 2/3 studies in these inflammatory disorders are assessed. The safety profile of long-term B-cell depletion in MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD will be highlighted. Finally implications of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the management of patients with these disorders and the use of B cell-depleting agents will be discussed.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Transmission From People Without COVID-19 Symptoms. Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is readily transmitted person to person. Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed., Objective: To assess the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the community that likely occur from persons without symptoms., Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model assessed the relative amount of transmission from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals across a range of scenarios in which the proportion of transmission from people who never develop symptoms (ie, remain asymptomatic) and the infectious period were varied according to published best estimates. For all estimates, data from a meta-analysis was used to set the incubation period at a median of 5 days. The infectious period duration was maintained at 10 days, and peak infectiousness was varied between 3 and 7 days (-2 and +2 days relative to the median incubation period). The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was varied between 0% and 70% to assess a wide range of possible proportions., Main Outcomes and Measures: Level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals., Results: The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms., Conclusions and Relevance: In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.	false
0	Factors Associated with Psychological Distress and Brief Resilient Coping Level During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-Care Professionals in Dessie, Ethiopia. Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious threats to people's health and lives in the world. The health-care professionals are bravely fighting on the front lines of the pandemic everywhere in the world. Our study is the first to study psychological distress and coping status among health-care professionals of Dessie town, Ethiopia during the unbridled time of the COVID-19 outbreak., Methods: A cross-sectional internet-based study was conducted between June 20 and July 13, 2020. The questionnaires included the demographic information, COVID-19 related questions, Kasseler-10 to assess psychological distress level and Brief Resilient Coping Scale, and Oslo-3 social support scale questionnaire were employed., Results: A total of 423 participants were involved in the study with a response rate of 100%. The mean age of respondents was 34.5 years (SD = +/-8.45 years). The prevalence of psychological distress among participants was 42%. Of these 18%, 11%, and 13% had mild, moderate, and severe psychological distress levels. Being married, being nurses and pharmacies, current substance users, working in emergency and outpatient departments, history of chronic medical illness, brief resilient coping level, and social support level were particularly associated with high psychological distress., Conclusion: Health-care professionals are experiencing a substantial level of psychological distress. In addition to other modifying factors coping level and social support was a significant predictor of psychological distress among health-care professionals. These findings should inform the implementation of interventions that increase coping resilience and social support to mitigate the impact of psychological distress among health-care professionals.

BACKGROUND: Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is currently the most widely used method for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, false negatives and the sensitivity of this mode of testing have been problematic for accurately estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates., OBJECTIVE: Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether technical and, therefore, correctable errors were being made with regards to nasopharyngeal swab procedure., METHODS: Methods: Online video database (YouTube) was queried for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Videos were rated by three blinded rhinologists for accuracy of swab angle and depth. The overall score respectively for swab angle and swab depth for each NPS video was determined by the majority score with agreement among at least two out of three reviewers. Video data between YouTube videos with correct NPS technique and videos with incorrect NPS technique were compared. Multiple linear regression analysis with statistical significance set at P=0.05 was used to determine video data variables associated with correct NPS technique., RESULTS: Results: 126 videos met inclusion and exclusion criteria. 52% (N=66) of total NPS videos were determined to have correct angle while 46% (N=58) showed appropriate depth. 44% (N=57) of videos had both correct NPS angle and appropriate depth while 48% (N=59) of videos had both incorrect NPS angle and inappropriate depth. Videos with correct NPS technique were associated with the swab operator identifying as a medical professional and as an ENT-related medical professional. Correct NPS technique was also associated with more recent video publication date relative to May 15, 2020., CONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Greater attention needs to be given towards educating frontline healthcare workers performing NPS, as this study shows that over half of videos documenting NPS show incorrect technique, which could elevate false negative rates.	false

OBJECTIVE: to determine the early signs of structural changes in brain white matter in small vessel disease associated with arterial hypertension and exposure to ionizing radiation using DTI-MRI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 45 patients (mean age (57.56 +/- 6.34) years) with small vessel disease (SVD) associatedwith arterial hypertension (AH) were examined: group I - 20 patients, participants of liquidation of the accident atthe Chornobyl nuclear power plant (Chornobyl clean-up workers); group II - 25 patients not exposed to ionizingradiation. MRI was performed on an Ingenia 3T tomograph (<>). The fractional anisotropy (FA) was determined in the main associative and commissural pathways, periventricular prefrontal areas (fasciculus fronto-occipitalis superior / anterior - f. FO ant., corona radiata anterior - CR ant.) and semioval centers (SC)., RESULTS: No signs of cerebral cortex or brain white matter (WM) atrophy, intracerebral microhemorrhages, and widespread areas of leukoaraiosis consolidation were observed in the examined patients. In the Chornobyl clean-up workers a larger number of foci of subcortical leukoaraiosis was visualized (80 %) on MRI images including multiple -8 (40 %), > 0.5 cm - 10 (50 %), with signs of consolidation - 5 (25 %). The results of the FA analysis in semiovalcenters showed its significant decrease in the patients of groups I and II (p < 0,007), regardless of the presence orabsence of visual signs of subcortical leukoaraiosis (ScLA) (III gr.: 253-317, p < 0.00001; IV gr.: 287- 375,p < 0.001). FA indicators in f. FO ant. and CR ant. in the patients of groups I and II differed insignificantly but weresubstantially lower than controls (p < 0.05). FA was significantly lower, compared to reference levels, in visuallyunchanged f. FO ant. (0.389-0.425; p = 0.015) and CR ant. (0.335-0.403; p = 0.05). In patients with AH-associated SVD of middle age, regardless of the effects of ionizing radiation, no significant changes in FA in the mainWM associative and commissural pathways were found (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: DTI-MRI allows to detect early signs of structural changes in the white matter of the brain - a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy indicators in visually unchanged periventricular and subcortical areas. Themain associative and commissural pathways of the brain remain intact in the absence of widespread consolidatedfoci of leukoaraiosis and lacunar infarctions. The negative impact of ionizing radiation on the course of SVD associated with arterial hypertension is manifested by more active processes of WM disorganization: the prevalence andtendency to the consolidation of periventricular and subcortical leukoaraiosis foci, a significant FA decrease in semioval centers.

0	Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) in 12 Patients Treated for SARS-CoV-2 Positive Pneumonia. ABSTRACT: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading throughout the world. The study describes 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who developed an acute erythematous rash with nonfollicular pinhead-sized pustules, without mucosal involvement. The clinical differential diagnosis was viral rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), or multiform erythema. computed tomography with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia and a respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients had signs of respiratory distress and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Punch biopsies showed subcorneal pustules typical of AGEP. Dermal microvascular injury and thrombosis as described in skin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed. The direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative in 8 patients investigated. A polymerase chain reaction for RNA SARS-CoV-2 performed on frozen skin was negative in 5 of 6 patients. Most of our patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. After some days (4-10), the diffuse erythema and pustules had improved. AGEP is classified as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, provoked by drugs and acute infections. Characteristically, removal of the offending agent leads to spontaneous resolution typically in less than 15 days. The recognition of AGEP is important, in order to avoid confusion with a systemic infection and consequently to avoid incorrect treatment. Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs are common and are major health problems worldwide causing considerable costs for health care systems. We suggest that in the patients with AGEP during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, viral infection is a risk factor for developing drug reaction. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Changes in demand for emergency ambulances during a nationwide lockdown that resulted in elimination of COVID-19: an observational study from New Zealand. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a 5-week national lockdown on ambulance service demand during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand., DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional, observational study., SETTING: High-quality data from ambulance electronic clinical records, New Zealand., PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period., RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection serology validation of different methods: Usefulness of IgA in the early phase of infection. In the late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. A novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory samples of patients with pneumonia as showed by the sequence analysis of the virus genomes obtained; The novel coronavirus was named SARSCoV-2. Reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) is the method of choice for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the high sensitive of the real-time PCR tests, sometimes samples from the upper respiratory tract may result negative even in the presence of radiological findings of pneumonia probably due to the viral load in the upper respiratory tract is low compared to the lower respiratory tract; low quality of the collected sample or technical reasons linked to the assay used. The use of serological assays may help in making diagnosis. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies, for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. In this work, we tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay, two ELISA assays and an ECLIA assay. Among the platforms assessed in this study, the ECLIA serological assay performed best, and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. Taken together, if a reflex test could be set in the laboratory, the ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.	false
0	Clinical evaluation of commercial automated SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. OBJECTIVE: Numerous immunoassays for detecting antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 have rapidly been developed and released. Validations of these have been performed with a limited number of samples. The lack of standardization might lead to significantly different results. This study compares ten automated assays from six vendors in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility., METHODS: This study compared ten fully automated IAs from the following vendors: Diasorin, Epitope Diagnostics, Euroimmun, Roche, YHLO, and Snibe. The retrospective part of the study included patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and controls comprised patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was excluded. Furthermore, biobanked sera were taken as negative controls (n = 97). The retrospective part involved four classes: 1) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (n = 183); 1B) suspected COVID-19 infection (n = 167) without qRT-PCR result but positive serological results from at least two different assays, and suspected COVID-19 infection due to a positive serological result from the Roche assay (n = 295); 2) biobanked sera obtained from patients before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 97) as negative controls. 2A) probably COVID-19-negative sera with negative serological results from at least two different assays (n = 152)., RESULTS: Overall diagnostic sensitivities were: Euroimmun(IgA) 87%; Epitope Diagnostics(IgG) 83%; YHLO(IgG) 77%; Roche(IgM/IgG) 77%; Euroimmun(IgG) 75%; Diasorin(IgG) 53%; Epitope Diagnostics(IgM) 52%; Snibe(IgG) 47%; YHLO(IgM) 35%; Snibe(IgM) 26%. Diagnostic specificities were: YHLO(IgG) 100%; Roche, 100%; Snibe(IgM/IgG) 100%; Diasorin(IgG) 97%; Euroimmun(IgG), 94%; YHLO(IgM) 94%; Euroimmun(IgA) 83%., CONCLUSION: Assays from different vendors vary substantially in terms of their performance. Our findings might facilitate the selection of appropriate serological assays. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	Autoimmune hemolytic anemia as a novel complication of covid-19 infection in sanglah general hospital Bali, Indonesia. BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be asymptomatic, mild to severe, even mortality. Although various hematological complications associated with COVID-19 infection have been reported, the finding of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a novel case. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room because of a 5-day period of fever with cough and shortness of breath. At admission, she was takipnea, jaundice, and had an oxygen saturation of 60% on room air. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 3.68 g/dL, high reticulocyte (14.4%), and hyperbilirubinemia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumonia with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test. Although she got packed red cell (PRC) transfusions in 7 days, her Hb remained low and bilateral infiltrate still increased. That's why we considered direct Coombs test and it returned positive. AIHA was diagnosed and treatment with hydrocortisone 100 mg IV twice daily was given for the first 72 h. The maintenance dose with methylprednisolone 16 mg twice daily was continued for 7 days admission. Then, Hb value increased to 11.03 g/dL and she was discharged home without any compliments. CONCLUSION(S): In the current epidemiological situation, AIHA needs to be considered as a complication of COVID-19 infection in a patient who presents with jaundice and severe anemia without any underlying chronic disease, which is need blood transfusions, steroid medication use, or blood cancer.Copyright © 2020 I.

0	Performance of at-home self-collected saliva and nasal-oropharyngeal swabs in the surveillance of COVID-19. Background: SARS-CoV-2 quickly spreads in the worldwide population, imposing social restrictions to control the infection, being the massive testing another essential strategy to break the chain of transmission. Aim(s): To compare the performance of at-home self-collected samples-saliva and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP)-for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a telemedicine platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed 201 patients who met the criteria of suspected COVID-19. NOP sampling was combined (nostrils and oropharynx) and saliva collected using a cotton pad device. Detection of SARS-COV-2 was performed by using the Altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0. Results: There was an overall significant agreement (kappa coefficient value of 0.58) between saliva and NOP. Considering results in either sample, 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva. Conclusion(s): Our data show the feasibility of using at-home self-collected samples (especially saliva), as an adequate alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This new approach of testing can be useful to develop strategies for COVID-19 surveillance and for guiding public health decisions.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

We performed a prospective study of 501 patients, regardless of symptoms, admitted to the hospital, to estimate the predictive value of a negative nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At a positivity rate of 10.2%, the estimated negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.2% and the NPV rose as prevalence decreased during the study.	false
0	Effect of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir on the QT corrected interval in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prolongs QTc corrected interval (QTc). The effect and safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in combination with these therapies have seldom been studied., OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate changes in QTc in patients receiving double (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and triple therapy (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin + Lopinavir/Ritonavir) to treat COVID-19. Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality., METHODS: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy., RESULTS: 168 patients (+/-66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748). Overall, 33 patients (19.6%) had a peak QTc and/or an increase QTc 60 ms from baseline, with a higher prevalence among those with hypokalemia (p = 0.003). All-cause mortality was similar between both strategy groups (p = 0.093) and high risk QTc prolongation was no related to clinical events in this series., CONCLUSIONS: DT and TT prolong the QTc in patients with COVID-19. Addition of Lopinavir/Ritonavir on top of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin did not increase QTc compared to DT. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Examining the relationship between household air pollution and infant microbial nasal carriage in a Ghanaian cohort. Background: Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Method(s): Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Result(s): In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusion(s): Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.Copyright © 2019	false
0	Abnormal liver enzyme and its impact on in-hospital complications and mortality among patients with COVID-19 from a large safety net hospital. INTRODUCTION: Several studies have demonstrated gastrointestinal manifestation in patients with coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is limited data on the prognostic role of liver enzymes. METHOD(S): We reviewed records of 135 patients admitted to our institution with a positive COVID-19 test. These patients were divided into those with or without abnormal liver enzymes (ALE). A patient is considered to have abnormal liver enzymes if any of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, total or direct bilirubin were above the upper limit of normal. We compared baseline demographics, other laboratory findings, inhospital complications, and mortality between those with vs. without ALE. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for study outcomes in those with ALE compared to those without ALE. Outcomes of interest were mortality, acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. RESULT(S): Of the 135 patients, 53% had ALE. Themean age of the sample was 59.5616. ARF (53 % vs 30 %; P = 0.02), acute kidney injury (69 % vs 40 %; P = 0.002), cardiac arrest (21 % vs 6 %; P = 0.03), and mortality (22 vs 6 %; P = 0.02) was significantly higher in patients with ALE. Table 1 displays the adjusted odds ratio for the study outcomes. Compared to those without ALE, those with ALE had higher odds for mortality, acute kidney injury, ARF, ARDS, and cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION(S): Our study demonstrated, ALE is highly prevalent among patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality and complications.	false
0	COVIDOSE: A Phase II Clinical Trial of Low-Dose Tocilizumab in the Treatment of Noncritical COVID-19 Pneumonia. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated hyperinflammation may contribute to the mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in COVID-19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of low-dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >= 40 mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400 mg or 8 mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200 mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty-two patients received low-dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL-6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40-200 mg. Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results of this trial provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has generated major mental and psychological health problems worldwide. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We searched online biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, CNKI, and Wanfang Data) and preprint databases (SSRN, bioRxiv, and MedRxiv) for observational studies from January 1, 2020 to March 16, 2020 investigating the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic., RESULTS: We retrieved 821 citations from the biomedical databases and 53 citations from the preprint databases: 66 studies with 221,970 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia was 31.4%, 31.9%, 41.1% and 37.9%, respectively. Noninfectious chronic disease patients, quarantined persons, and COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of depression (Q=26.73, p<0.01) and anxiety (Q=21.86, p<0.01) than other populations. The general population and non-medical staff had a lower risk of distress than other populations (Q=461.21, p< 0.01). Physicians, nurses, and non-medical staff showed a higher prevalence of insomnia (Q=196.64, p<0.01) than other populations., LIMITATIONS: All included studies were from the early phase of the global pandemic. Additional meta-analyses are needed to obtain more data in all phases of the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic increases the mental health problems of the global population, particularly health care workers, noninfectious chronic disease patients, COVID-19 patients, and quarantined persons. Interventions for mental health are urgently needed for preventing mental health problems. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Infection Control Citations in Nursing Homes: Compliance and Geographic Variability. OBJECTIVES: To report the initial compliance with new infection control regulations and geographic disparities in nursing homes (NHs) in the United States., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from November 27, 2017 to November 27, 2019., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 14,894 NHs in the continental United States comprising 26,201 inspections and 176,841 deficiencies., METHODS: We measured the cumulative incidence of receiving F880: Infection Prevention and Control deficiencies, geographic variability of F880 citations across the United States, and the scope and severity of the infection control deficiencies., RESULTS: A total of 6164 NHs (41%) in the continental United States received 1 deficiency for F880, and 2300 NHs (15%) were cited more than once during the 2-year period. Geographic variation was evident for F880 deficiencies, ranging from 20% of NHs in North Carolina to 79% of NHs in West Virginia. Between 0% (Vermont) and 33% (Michigan) of states' NHs were cited multiple times over 2 years. Facilities receiving 2 or more F880 deficiencies were more reliant on Medicaid, for-profit, and served more acute residents. Infection Prevention and Control deficiencies were of similar severity but of greater scope in NHs that were cited multiple times., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenges hospitals with an increased surge of patients from the community, NHs will be asked to accept convalescing patients who were previously infected with the virus. NHs will need to rely on infection control practices to mitigate the effects of the virus in their facilities. Particular attention to NHs that have fared poorly with repeat infection control practices deficiencies might be a good first step to improving care overall and preventing downstream morbidity and mortality among the highest-risk patients.

0	Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19: A case series of 711 patients. INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are increasingly being reported in patients with COVID-19 but there is no reliable data on the real magnitude of GI tract involvement. We present the results of our study of 711 patients for GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective chart review of the 711 adult patients who visited the Richmond University Medical Center and/or its ambulatory centers in New York City up until May 13, 2020, and tested positive for COVID-19. We analyzed the reported incidence of dysgeusia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and GI bleeding as well as LFT abnormalities. In case of deranged LFTs, we looked for preexisting liver disease, alcohol abuse, and anti-retroviral medication use. RESULT(S): A total of 711 patients were studied using inpatient charts, and laboratory data to identify abnormal findings. The mean age of patients was 60.5 years with slight male predominance (n = 395 vs 316). 27.1% (n = 193) reported GI symptom and an additional 56.9% (n = 405) had at least one liver enzyme abnormality. Diarrhea was the most common with a frequency of 17.3% (n = 86), nausea 16.2% (n = 80), anorexia/vomiting 13.7% (n = 68), and abdominal pain 5.6% (n = 28). The least reported symptoms were dysgeusia 3.2% (n = 16) and GI bleeding 2.2% (n = 11). Lipase level was elevated in 27.8% patients (n = 138). Among LFTs, AST alone was elevated in 16.6% (n = 118), ALT alone in 15.0% (n = 6), both AST/ALT 15.7% (n = 112), alkaline phosphatase 23% (n = 164), and bilirubin 10% (n = 71). Potential confounders were preexisting liver disease (n = 8), patients taking HIV medications (n = 9) and alcohol abuse. However, the enzyme levels in these patients were elevated above their baseline. PT/ INR was elevated in 13.4% (n = 95) of patients while only 27 of them were on oral anticoagulant. 88.6% (n = 630) of patients were admitted with respiratory failure, and 28.5% (n = 203) died. CONCLUSION(S): GI symptoms were experienced by 27% and hepatic dysfunction was at 57% in this study of 711 COVID-19 patients. This reflects a fairly high burden of GI involvement. As the covid- 19 pandemic continues its rampage, our understanding of its GI and hepatobiliary aspects is growing. This will improve our diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive armamentarium. Other implications for gastroenterlogists include prolonged viral shedding in stools, potential for fecal-oral transmission and risk of exposure during endocsopy. (Table Presented).	false
0	Covid-19 infection presenting with only gastrointestinal symptoms. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has currently spread to approximately 188 countries with current estimates of over 427,000 fatalities worldwide. It largely presents with respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are not common leading to delayed diagnosis. We present a case of an obese young man with no past medical history presenting with GI symptoms who was found to be COVID-19 positive. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 32-year-old obese male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with persistent nausea with nonbloody emesis, diarrhea, vague abdominal pain, and fever. He reported that a coworker had recently tested positive for COVID19. Significant labs on admission included AST 67 U/L, ALT 67 U/L, D-dimer 708.5 ng/ml, CRP 3.4 mg/ dL, LDH 341 U/L, ferritin 1,781 ng/mL, procalcitonin<0.05 ng/mL. Lipase was normal. Chest X-ray without acute pathology. Chest CT with contrast revealed nonspecific bilateral pneumonitis. Abdominal US revealed hepatic steatosis. With conservative measures including fluid resuscitation, patient's symptoms improved and he was discharged home to self-quarantine. DISCUSSION: It appears that COVID-19-related GI symptoms are due to the virus entering target cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is found throughout the digestive tract. This receptor is found at nearly 100-fold the amount in the GI tract as compared to the respiratory system. In a retrospective study of 206 patients with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China, it was found that those with GI symptoms demonstrated a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance. Additionally, it was found that such patients are more likely to have positive results on fecal testing as compared to those with predominantly respiratory symptoms. Those with both upper and lower digestive symptoms were more likely to present with fever as opposed to either alone which can delay timely diagnosis. In a meta-analysis of data from 29 COVID-19 studies with GI symptoms, prevalence was 15% and about 10% of patients presented with GI symptoms alone with the most common symptoms being nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. We live in unprecedented times, and should be wholly aware that COVID-19 infections can also present predominantly with gastrointestinal symptoms as delayed diagnosis is a major driver of this current COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Protocol for iGrow (Infant Growth and Development Study): biopsychosocial predictors of childhood obesity risk at 2 years. BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity remains a significant public health problem. To date, most research on the causes and correlates of obesity has focused on a small number of direct predictors of obesity rather than testing complex models that address the multifactorial nature of the origins of obesity in early development. We describe the rationale and methods of iGrow (Infant Growth and Development Study) which will test multiple pathways by which (a) prenatal maternal psychobiological risk predicts infant weight gain over the first 6 months of life, and (b) this early weight gain confers risk for obesity at age 2. Infant hormonal and psychobiological risk are proposed mediators from prenatal risk to early weight gain, though these are moderated by early maternal sensitivity and obesogenic feeding practices. In addition, higher maternal sensitivity and lower obesogenic feeding practices are proposed predictors of adaptive child self-regulation in the second year of life, and all three are proposed to buffer/reduce the association between high early infant weight gain and obesity risk at age 2., METHODS: iGrow is a prospective, longitudinal community-based study of 300 diverse mothers and infants to be followed across 5 data waves from pregnancy until children are age 2. Key measures include (a) maternal reports of demographics, stress, well-being, feeding practices and child characteristics and health; (b) direct observation of maternal and infant behavior during feeding, play, and distress-eliciting tasks during which infant heart rate is recorded to derive measures of vagal withdrawal; (c) anthropometric measures of mothers and infants; and (d) assays of maternal prenatal blood and infant saliva and urine. A host of demographic and other potential confounds will be considered as potential covariates in structural equation models that include tests of mediation and moderation. Efforts to mitigate the deleterious effects of COVID-19 on study success are detailed., DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to inform (1) basic science about early life processes casually related to childhood obesity and (2) development of targeted intervention and prevention approaches that consider mother, infant, and family risks and resources.	false
0	Serum levels of ACE2 are higher in patients with obesity and diabetes. Objective: As severity of outcome in COVID-19 is disproportionately higher among individuals with obesity, smokers, patients with hypertension, kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease (CHD), and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D), serum levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were examined in these high-risk groups. Method(s): Associations of ACE2 levels to smokers and patients with hypertension, T2D, obesity, CHD, or COPD were investigated in a single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75 +/- 6 years), using multiple linear regression analysis. Result(s): Serum levels of ACE2 were higher in smokers and individuals with T2D and/or obesity while they were unaffected in the other patient groups. Conclusion(s): ACE2 levels are higher in some patient groups with comorbidities linked to COVID-19 including obesity and T2D and as such may have an emerging role as a circulating biomarker for severity of outcome in the disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Acute cholestatic liver injury: A unique case of EBV-associated hepatitis. INTRODUCTION: Patients may develop subclinical liver involvement during infections with Ebstein-Barr Virus (EBV) while acute cholestatic hepatitis is a much less common presentation. Early investigation for EBV should be considered in patients with viral prodromes and abnormal liver function tests with no demonstrable biliary obstruction on imaging. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 62-year old female presented with a 2-week history of fever, non specific back pain and new onset jaundice. She denied throat pain, new partners, high risk behaviors, or recent travel otherwise and had been told to self-quarantine from her employer given the possibility of COVID infection. Initial labs showed alkaline phosphatase of 1231 U/L, ALT 170 U/ L, AST of 158 U/L, and total bilirubin of 6 mg/dL with elevated GGT. Abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis, gallbladder sludge and gallbladder wall thickening and MRI MRCP demonstrated no evidence of biliary pathology. An abdominal CT with contrast was pursued with concern for back pain with the additional finding of splenomegaly. Further viral etiologies were explored including testing for COVID-19, EBV HIV, HSV, CMV, as well as other chronic liver disease work-up of antimitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, ANA and immunoglobulin levels. EBV IgM antibodies were mildly elevated at 1.0 IA(ref <0.9 IA) with a negative EBV IgG and a positive anti-smooth muscle antibody (1:80 dilution). Other work-up was essentially unremarkable. Liver biopsy was pursued given the possibility of seronegative PBC. Liver pathology revealed prominent portal and lobular hepatitis with some non-necrotizing granulomas and rare EBV positive cells. Quantitative EBV titer returned at 5060 viral copies confirming a diagnosis of EBV-associated hepatitis. Supportive treatment was continued and the patient was discharged in stable condition with interval follow-up. DISCUSSION: Epstein-Barr virus PCR can help identify infection early while IgM may be minimally elevated. This particular case demonstrated a lack of lymphadenopathy in an older patient with acute infectious mononucleosis and a rare manifestation of elevated liver enzymes in a cholestatic pattern. A positive anti-smooth muscle antibody or negative/borderline serology test in such cases may warrant liver biopsy to rule out other differential diagnoses in patients over the age of 60 but clinical history of a viral prodrome should be valued in the appropriate context to identify unusual causes of cholestatic liver injury.	false
0	Two for one: A case of covid-19 and epstein-barr virus-induced acute liver injury. INTRODUCTION: The majority of patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, but little is known about the hepatic manifestations of the infection. Retrospective studies have shown that in patients with COVID-19 that developed abnormal liver tests, a majority were male, had high fevers ( >102F) and higher levels of inflammatory markers, including ferritin. The degree of liver enzyme elevation was generally mild and transient. Currently there is no data to illustrate that patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing concomitant viral hepatitis infections. We present a case of a young patient with no other comorbidities, presenting with acute Ebstein-Barr viral hepatitis in the setting of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: An 18-year old male with no medical history was brought to the hospital after sustaining a nasal fracture after a fall due to alcohol intoxication. On admission, his COVID-19 screen was positive and he was febrile to 100.3F, oxygenating at 98% on room air, with mild symptoms of fatigue and malaise. On labs, he had elevated liver enzymes with aspartate transaminase (AST) of 326 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 401 U/L with normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Ferritin was elevated to 1342 ng/mL. A doppler ultrasound showed hepatic steatosis with patent hepatic vessels. A CT chest with contrast showed mild bronchial wall thickening suggestive of infectious or inflammatory airway process. He was started on Augmentin for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia, which was discontinued after 2 doses due to up trending transaminases seen in Table 1, and later switched to Levofloxacin. Due to the degree of elevation, he underwent an extensive workup for other causes of acute liver injury illustrated in Table 2. Ultimately, he was found to have an acute Ebstein-Barr (EBV) viral hepatitis infection. On hospital day 6, liver enzymes and ferritin began to downtrend and a liver biopsy was deferred. He remained asymptomatic was discharged with standard COVID-19 precautions. DISCUSSION: Case studies have shown that abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, however clinically significant liver injury is rare. Our patient developed acute liver injury with liver enzymes that were much higher than typically seen solely with COVID-19 infection. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high clinical index of suspicion to evaluate for other concomitant causes of acute liver injury even in COVID-19 positive patients.	false
0	PIN71 Comparison of Seasonality of Common Viral and Respiratory Diseases VS Emergence of Sars-COV-2 Infection. Objectives: The timing of the large SARS-Cov-2 outbreaks in the Northern hemisphere, and the temporary delay in infections observed in the Southern hemisphere during the first half of the year has prompted questions related to potential seasonality of SARS-Cov-2. This study is designed to evaluate patterns of known viral respiratory diseases in different regions of the US to provide a benchmark for comparison with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Method(s): Retrospective observational study using data from Optum PanTher. All patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses (starting April) or COVID-19-related severe diagnoses (acute severe respiratory distress - January to April) till end of June were identified. A time-series of hospitalization by region was established. For comparative purposes, time-series of hospital admissions for the flu, viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases (ORD) for the same time period in 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. Descriptive analyses were used to compare the time series. Result(s): A total of 70,829 patients with COVID-19 were compared to 46,056 flu, 168,185 pneumonia and and 680,888 ORD patients. Peak case volumes for ORD, flu and pneumonia were observed from January to March, with lowest case counts in July. From peak to lowest prevalence, there was 30-32% decrease in prevalence for ORD, a 41%-52% for pneumonia and a 98-99% for flu. Trends were most marked in the Midwest and least noticeable in the South. The significant increase of SARS-CoV-2 between January and April, with peak in April and slight decline in May, did not match timing of increased prevalence of the other known respiratory viral diseases. Conclusion(s): Available data to date did not suggest a seasonality for COVID-19 similar to that of other viral respiratory diseases. A limitation of our study is that the COVID-19 decline in some US states was also potentially affected by drastic government measures not present in prior years for flu, pneumonia or ORD.Copyright © 2020	false

INTRODUCTION: In present days scenario of pandemic of COVID 19 the protective reflexes namely Sneeze and Cough have received great importance but not in terms of protection but in terms of spread of infection. The present review tries to bring out the correlation between the physiology of sneeze and cough taking into consideration the various receptors that initiate the two reflexes then correlating it with the formation of expelled droplets and the significance of various aspect of droplets that lead to the spread of infection., MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the compilation of the present review we searched the terms ""Physiology of cough"", ""Physiology of sneeze"", ""droplets"", ""aerosols"" and ""Aerosols in COVID 19"". The above-mentioned terms were extensively searched on pubmed, google scholar and google search engine and after reviewing the various available material the most significant research has been taken into consideration for this review., CONCLUSION: Through this review we conclude that there are various factors that are responsible for the initiation of sneeze and cough but in case of infection it is mainly the inflammatory reaction that directly stimulates the receptors to produce the reflex outburst of air. As the flow of air during expiration is turbulent it causes damage to the Epithelial Lining Fluid present in the respiratory conduit and also gets admixed with the saliva in the oropharynx and oral cavity and mucus in the nose to form droplets of various sizes. Large droplets Settle close and are responsible for Droplet and Fomite transmission but the smaller droplets remain suspended in air and travel farther distances to cause Airborne transmission. The spread of droplet cloud in sneezing may range to 6m or more as compared to cough hence the concept of 1m to 2m of social distancing does not hold good if the patient is sneezing.

0	Achieving flexible competence: bridging the investment dichotomy between infectious diseases and cancer. Today's global health challenges in underserved communities include the growing burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs); infectious diseases (IDs) with epidemic and pandemic potential such as COVID-19; and health effects from catastrophic 'all hazards' disasters including natural, industrial or terrorist incidents. Healthcare disparities in low-income and middle-income countries and in some rural areas in developed countries make it a challenge to mitigate these health, socioeconomic and political consequences on our globalised society. As with IDs, cancer requires rapid intervention and its effective medical management and prevention encompasses the other major NCDs. Furthermore, the technology and clinical capability for cancer care enables management of NCDs and IDs. Global health initiatives that call for action to address IDs and cancer often focus on each problem separately, or consider cancer care only a downstream investment to primary care, missing opportunities to leverage investments that could support broader capacity-building. From our experience in health disparities, disaster preparedness, government policy and healthcare systems we have initiated an approach we call flex-competence which emphasises a systems approach from the outset of program building that integrates investment among IDs, cancer, NCDs and disaster preparedness to improve overall healthcare for the local community. This approach builds on trusted partnerships, multi-level strategies and a healthcare infrastructure providing surge capacities to more rapidly respond to and manage a wide range of changing public health threats.

0	ANALISE DOS GRUPOS SANGUINEOS ABO E RH(D) EM PACIENTES COM COVID-19 QUE NECESSITARAM DE TRANSFUSAO SANGUINEA. Objetivos: A disseminacao rapida e global do novo SARS-CoV-2 tornou a identificacao de fatores de risco uma prioridade nas politicas publicas. Ja foram estabelecidos alguns destes riscos como idade, sexo, diversas doencas cronicas e alteracoes laboratoriais (SCHI et al., 2020). A associacao de grupo sanguineo e doencas deve sempre ser cautelosamente investigada porque a frequencia de grupos sanguineos varia entre as populacoes. Dessa forma, o objetivo deste estudo e avaliar os grupos sanguineos ABO/Rh(D), sexo e idade dos pacientes com diagnostico de COVID-19 em um hospital de referencia, bem como a necessidade transfusional desses individuos. Material e metodos: Foi realizado um estudo retrospectivo com analise de prontuario eletronico no sistema Tasy e banco de dados no sistema e-Delphyn do Servico de Hemoterapia do Hospital Sao Vicente de Paulo, no municipio de Passo Fundo/RS. Foram incluidos no estudo pacientes com diagnostico confirmado de COVID-19 por metodo de PCR que necessitaram de transfusao de hemocomponentes no periodo de marco a julho de 2020. Resultados: Foram identificados no periodo estudado 1202 pacientes positivos para coronavirus na instituicao e destes 53 (4,5%) necessitaram de transfusao de hemocomponentes, sendo 28 (52,8%) do sexo masculino e 25 (47,2%) do sexo feminino. A media de idade foi de 65 anos (+/-15,4). Quanto a classificacao ABO/Rh(D), 21 (39,6%) eram do grupo sanguineo A Rh(D) positivo, 20 (37,7%) O Rh (D) positivo, 4 (7,5%) A Rh(D) negativo, 3 (5,7%) AB Rh(D) positivo, 3 (5,7%) O Rh(D) negativo, 1 (1,8%) AB Rh(D) negativo e 1 (1,8%) paciente B Rh(D) positivo. A media de transfusoes de concentrado de hemacias foi de 3,75 unidades por paciente (+/-2,7), de plasma fresco congelado foi de 4,82 unidades (+/-2,6) e somente um paciente precisou transfundir crioprecipitado. Discussao: Estudos previamente publicados relataram uma possivel associacao entre o tipo sanguineo A e um maior risco de infeccao e mortalidade por COVID-19, enquanto os tipos O e B foram associados a um menor risco (ZHAO et al., 2020). Encontramos heterogeneidade na distribuicao de grupos sanguineos, sendo que o tipo A Rh (D) positivo foi o mais prevalente entre os pacientes do estudo, corroborando com resultados previamente publicados por outros autores. Nossa populacao e composta em sua maioria por descendentes europeus, sendo assim ha uma prevalencia de individuos do grupo O Rh (D) positivo em torno de 40%, apesar disso na populacao avaliada neste estudo houve uma prevalencia de individuos do grupo A Rh (D) positivo. Quanto a distribuicao por sexo os estudos mostram um maior numero de individuos do sexo masculino (SCHI et al., 2020) de encontro com nosso estudo. Conclusao: Nao ha como afirmar a associacao do grupo sanguineo A positivo com COVID-19 sem resultados cientificamente comprovados em diferentes populacoes. E importante ressaltar que mesmo vivendo um momento de pandemia, ha necessidade de se manter os estoques de hemocomponentes adequados, para atender a demanda ja existente e a necessidade transfusional ate mesmo para os pacientes acometidos pela COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Vitamin D deficiency among patients with COVID-19: case series and recent literature review. BACKGROUND: The world is now challenging the pandemic of COVID-19 infection. This is the third and most extensive pandemic. Previous studies showed the plausibility of vitamin D prophylaxis and therapy for COVID-19, particularly in settings where hypovitaminosis D is frequent. Recent study from Indonesian showed that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 23.0%. The examination of vitamin D status is not a routine in the Indonesian clinical setting., METHODS: This study is a case series from confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Bethesda Hospital Yogyakarta Indonesia. The data of clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory examinations were obtained from the electronic medical records. The vitamin D status was measured by Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) method. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies that included terms for Vitamin D and COVID-19., RESULTS: The data were obtained from 10 participants consisting of 50% male and 50% female. The mean age was 49.6 years. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this study was 90% (vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL) and 10% of insufficiency (vitamin D levels < 30 ng/mL). Patients in this study had various symptoms such as fatigue (60%), fever (50%), dry cough (40%), non-specific headache (10%), and diarrhea (10%); have no symptoms (20%); and also had the various chronic diseases as comorbidity such as hypertension (40%), diabetes (10%), COPD (10%), and post stroke (10%)., CONCLUSIONS: All of the COVID-19 patients in this study had hypovitaminosis D. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this case series is 90% and only 1 patient (10%) had vitamin D insufficiency. There are many health benefits of vitamin D and very few adverse effects. Randomized controlled trials need to determine and evaluate this recommendation in preventing or treating COVID-19. Clinicians should continue to treat people with vitamin D deficiency especially in managing COVID-19 patients.	false
0	C-reactive protein as an early predictor of COVID-19 severity. Background: Data for predicting severity of patients with COVID-19 infection are sparse and still under investigation. We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) can serve as nearly predictor of disease severity during COVID-19 infection in comparison with other hematologic and inflammatory markers., Methods: We included all consecutive patients who were admitted in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco, between February to April 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via RT-PCR. The complete blood count and serum CRP level were routinely measured on admission. All clinical and laboratory data of patients were collected and analyzed. The classification of the disease severity was in accordance with the clinical classification of the WHO interim guidance, and the management of patients were adapted to the national management guideline. We estimated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of blood routine parameters as well as their association with COVID-19 disease severity., Results: 145 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The median age (range) was 50 (32-63) years, and 75 (51.7%) were men. 101 patients were classified in the non-severe group and 44 patients in the severe group. Based on disease severity, significant differences were observed in the age, gender, comorbidities, and respiratory symptom. Similarly, the biological analysis found significant differences for the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and CRP level. However, according to ROC curves of these laboratory biomarkers, the AUC of CRP at 0.872 was significantly higher than all other parameters. Further, CRP was independently associated with severity of COVID-19 disease (OR = 1.11, 95% IC (1.01-1.22) and or = 1.13, 95% IC (1.04-1.23))., Conclusions: This study found that the CRP level at admission represent a simple and independent factor that can be useful for early detection of severity during COVID-19 and the easy guidance of primary care.

0	Analysis of factors for disease progression in 61 patients with COVID-19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze clinical characteristics and laboratory results of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) patients so as to identify factors related to disease progression., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: an improvement/stabilization group (n = 53) and a progression group (n = 8). Clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between the two groups., RESULTS: Of the sixty-one patients, thirty-one were male (50.8%), and thirty were female (49.2%), with a median age of 53 years. On admission, significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the levels of Creatine Kinase (CK), lymphocytes, D-dimer and creatinine, and prothrombin time (PT). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocytes, Mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), CK, White Blood count to mean platelet volume ratio (WMR), Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and serum creatinine were important factors for disease progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PLR was an independent factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the best predictor of disease progression was CK. Dynamic changes in the laboratory indicators of patients were tracked, and significant differences were found in the variation trends of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and WMR, which gradually increased in the progression group, but gradually decreased in the improvement/stabilization group., CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for disease progression included PLR, lymphocytes, MPVLR, CK, WMR, LMR, and creatinine, among which, PLR is an independent risk factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients in the United States. INTRODUCTION: Although the typical presentation of COVID-19 infection includes fever and respiratory complaints, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are also common at the time of diagnosis. Case-series mainly from eastern Asia have reported varying frequency of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Given the regional variations in manifestation of disease, we sought to analyze the prevalence and characterization of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the northeastern region of the United States. METHOD(S): We identified and analyzed all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at our institution between January and March of 2020. Those patients who were hospitalized and confirmed to have COVID-19 infection served as the cases. Patients during the same time period who tested negative for COVID-19 served as controls. Detailed information, including patient demographics, presenting complaints, diagnostic testing, hospital course, and outcomes, was collected. We categorized GI symptoms to include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, red blood per rectum, melena, loss of appetite, and loss of taste. RESULT(S): Out of 307 hospitalized patients who were tested for COVID-19 at our institution, 139 patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and 131 patients tested negative for COVID-19. The remaining 37 patients were excluded due to inconclusive or incomplete results. Diarrhea (25.2%, OR = 2.4) and loss of appetite (25.9%, OR = 3.2) were the most common GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and both were significantly more common when compared to the patients in the control group [Table 1]. Other GI symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were present in 10-20% of COVID-19 patients. Isolated gastrointestinal symptoms without the presence of respiratory symptoms occurred in 7.2% of COVID-19 patients at time of diagnosis. New-onset GI symptoms after admission were noted in 17.4% of COVID-19 patients. There was no significant association between the presence of GI symptoms and disease severity. CONCLUSION(S): Diarrhea and loss of appetite were the most common presenting GI symptoms in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection when compared to the control group. About 7% of COVID-19 positive patients presented with isolated GI symptoms alone. New-onset of GI symptoms developed during admission in 17% of COVID-19 patients. The presence of GI symptoms does not appear to be an independent predictor of severe disease or the need for ICU admission.	false

Immun. 88 (2020) 901-907] (Brain Behavior and Immunity (2020) 88 (901-907), (S08891. The authors regret that a number of inaccuracies have been noted in Table 2 detailing the Modified Newcastle-Otawa Scale quality assessment scores. The study Huang J.Z. et al. had been taken into account during the quality assessment process and included in the original submission but was replaced by the word ""Author"" and some studies have changed order in the table during the production process. Furthermore, Du et al. and Zhang W. et al. were not assigned a star; with an additional star, Du et al. becomes low risk of bias whereas Zhang et al. remains low risk of bias. No star had been allocated in the original table for the response rate of Du et al. and this has been also rectified as shown in the corrected table below. The changes in the quality assessment score also affect the pooled estimates of low bias risk studies as Du et al. becomes low risk of bias. The adjusted low risk of bias values are 23.78% (instead of 24.06%) (95% CI 16.95%-31.34%, I2 = 99%) for Anxiety in 10 studies and 21.75% (instead of 22.93%), (95% CI 12.72%-32.34%, I2 = 99.62%) for Depression in 9 studies.

0	Research output and international cooperation among countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: Scientometric analysis. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has instigated immediate and massive worldwide research efforts. Rapid publication of research data may be desirable but also carries the risk of quality loss. Objective(s): This analysis aimed to correlate the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak with its related scientific output per country. Method(s): All articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic were retrieved from Web of Science and analyzed using the web application SciPE (science performance evaluation), allowing for large data scientometric analyses of the global geographical distribution of scientific output. Result(s): A total of 7185 publications, including 2592 articles, 2091 editorial materials, 2528 early access papers, 1479 letters, 633 reviews, and other contributions were extracted. The top 3 countries involved in COVID-19 research were the United States, China, and Italy. The confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths per region correlated with scientific research output. The United States was most active in terms of collaborative efforts, sharing a significant amount of manuscript authorships with the United Kingdom, China, and Italy. The United States was China's most frequent collaborative partner, followed by the United Kingdom. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 research landscape is rapidly developing and is driven by countries with a generally strong prepandemic research output but is also significantly affected by countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Our findings indicate that the United States is leading international collaborative efforts.Copyright © Nadja Grammes, Dominic Millenaar, Tobias Fehlmann, Fabian Kern, Michael Bohm, Felix Mahfoud, Andreas Keller.

0	Maximum Daily Temperature, Precipitation, Ultraviolet Light, and Rates of Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in the United States. BACKGROUND: Previous reports have suggested that transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is reduced by higher temperatures and higher humidity. We analyzed case data from the United States to investigate the effects of temperature, precipitation, and ultraviolet (UV) light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHOD(S): Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 22 January 2020 to 3 April 2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modeling to determine whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV index, and the incidence 5 days later were related. RESULT(S): A maximum temperature above 52degreeF on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [0.76, 0.96]; P = .009). Among observations with daily temperatures below 52degreeF, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days (IRR, 0.98 [0.97, 0.99]; P = .001). A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days (IRR, 0.97 [0.95, 0.99]; P = .004). Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days (IRR, 0.98 [0.89, 1.08]; P = .65). CONCLUSION(S): The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up to 52degreeF and is lower at warmer vs cooler temperatures. However, the association between temperature and transmission is small, and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	SEIAQRDT model for the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A case study in India. COVID-19 is a global pandemic declared by WHO. This pandemic requires the execution of planned control strategies, incorporating quarantine, self-isolation, and tracing of asymptomatic cases. Mathematical modeling is one of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of COVID-19. The predictions of earlier proposed epidemiological models (e.g. SIR, SEIR, SIRD, SEIRD, etc.) are not much accurate due to lack of consideration for transmission of the epidemic during the latent period. Moreover, it is important to classify infected individuals to control this pandemic. Therefore, a new mathematical model is proposed to incorporate infected individuals based on whether they have symptoms or not. This model forecasts the number of cases more accurately, which may help in better planning of control strategies. The model consists of eight compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), asymptomatic (A), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), deaths (D), and insusceptible (T), accumulatively named as SEIAQRDT. This model is employed to predict the pandemic results for India and its majorly affected states. The estimated number of cases using the SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models. The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The simulation is done on real datasets and results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results may help the government and individuals to make the planning in this pandemic situation.	false
0	A review on corona virus and covid-19. Covid-19, the pandemic disease brought about by SARS-CoV-2. It is an intense infection contamination. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. This infection influences the nose, eyes, respiratory parcel, lungs and so on of the patients. In view of the momentum research proof it is recognized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 happens generally individual to-individual through respiratory droplets inside a scope of 180 cm. The infection can likewise be communicated if an individual contacts a mucosal surface subsequent to contacting an article with the infection on it. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the progressing flare-up to be a worldwide general wellbeing crisis. Since there is not precise treatment and antibody for the treatment of Covid-19. Be that as it may, an enemy of malarial medication hydroxychloroquin now a day utilized in the treatment of Covid-19. Genomic correlation has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 has 80% similarity to Rhinolophus sinicus bat and 96% likeness with the Rhinolophus affinis bat. By finding the current distributed proof, this survey deliberately sums up the study of disease transmission, genomic structure, pathogenic mechanism, clinical quality, method of transmission, treatment and prevention of Covid-19.Copyright © 2020, Global Research Online.

0	Gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic manifestations identified through advocate lutheran coronavirus (ALCO) database. INTRODUCTION: SAR-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China that has led to a global pandemic with an associated high morality. Literature from Wuhan, China, has shown that digestive symptoms are also very common in those patients with COVID 19 infection in addition to elevated liver enzymes. The ALCO database is being created at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Illinois to evaluate the prevalence, incidence and outcomes of those patients with affected by COVID19 with GI manifestations. METHOD(S): Retrospective analysis was performed of all patients presenting to Lutheran General Hospital Emergency Department (ED) between March1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 due to an active COVID 19 infection identified by ICD Code U07.1COVID19. After comprehensive chart review, clinical features and laboratory values between those with digestive versus those without were compared. RESULT(S): Four hundred forty-four patient encounters have been analyzed from a total of 385 patients seen in the ED: 60 patients were treated in the ED and 82 were hospitalized. GI symptoms characterized by diarrhea (26%), abdominal pain (6%), nausea (16%), vomiting (7.5%) and anorexia (23%) were identified by 47.2% of patients on admission (n = 68) (Figure 1). 79% of these patients had concomitant upper respiratory symptoms identified as shortness of breath, sore throat, or cough (n = 54). Patients presenting with GI symptoms had no underlying chronic digestive diseases. Admission laboratory tests of interests included AST (n = 96), ALT (n = 96), Ferritin (n = 73), Procalcitonin (68), LDH (64) and CRP (n = 65) (Figure 2). Patients with GI symptoms were found to have non-statistically significant levels of elevated transaminases, Ferritin, and LDH on admission in those without GI symptoms.Those presenting with GI symptoms were more likely to be hospitalized (n = 42, 61%) versus those without (n = 34, 44%). Length of stay was greater in those presenting with GI symptoms (M 1 = 5.43 days) versus those without (M2 = 4.42 days), (P = 0.273, Mann- Whitney test.) No difference in mortality was seen. CONCLUSION(S): Preliminary data supports studies from China that GI symptoms are rather common secondary to COVID19. The initial trends from the ALCO database support that GI symptoms are indicative of severe disease characterized by increased inflammation, elevated transaminases and longer hospitalizations. Our hope is continued investigation during the current outbreak will lead to more information to clarify the role of GI manifestations in COVID19.	false
0	Gastric metastasis of invasive lobular breast carcinoma. INTRODUCTION: Malignancies metastasizing to the stomach are rare and occur during the late stages of malignancy. Primary malignancies associated with gastric metastases include melanoma, esophagus, lung, renal cell carcinoma and breast. Of patients with metastatic breast cancer, one review reported a 0.3% incidence rate.We report a patient with known metastatic breast cancer to the bone and healing gastric ulcers found to have biopsy-proven breast cancer metastasis to the stomach. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 74 year-old female with a past medical history of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast complicated by bone metastases presented to an outpatient clinic for hospital follow-up. Although originally presenting to the hospital secondary to hematemesis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings reported a pyloric ulcer with a bleeding vessel requiring epinephrine injections and heater probe cauterization. The ulcer was likely due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. She was discharged with a proton pump inhibitor twice daily with no further bleeding. Follow-up EGD reported ulcer healing; however, antral thickening was noted. Antral biopsies reported poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative staining for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2 whereas estrogen receptor staining reported nuclear positivity in the neoplastic cells with mammaglobin suggesting breast cancer as the primary source. She was continued on palliative chemotherapy with palbociclib, letrozole, and denosumab. Unfortunately, she suffered frequent admissions for recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage and eventually passed away due to complications of coronavirus disease 2019. DISCUSSION: Metastases to the stomach are a rare complication of breast cancer. Such etiologies could be considered in breast cancer patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Given her history of a gastric ulcer secondary to NSAID use, symptoms of hematemesis was attributed to gastric ulcers. However, gastric mucosal irregularities are not always obvious with metastatic lesions. Furthermore, up to 30% of cases may be missed due to metastatic spread to deep mucosal layers. Given this, in patients with a history of malignancy, suspicion for metastatic lesions should remain high especially if they have gastric mucosal irregularities. These should always be investigated with biopsies to prevent delays in management.	false
0	Amyloidosis involving the gastrointestinal tract. INTRODUCTION: Amyloidosis is a generic term that refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of normal serum proteins. There are many different types of amyloid proteins that can be associated with various disease processes including Alzheimer's dementia, nephrotic syndrome, restrictive cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, bleeding diathesis, and macroglossia among others. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 79-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and congenital singular kidney presented to the emergency department with complaints of skin bruising and leg swelling for several months. The patient also reported fatigue, alternating diarrhea and constipation, along with more than a twenty-pound weight loss 6 months. Examination revealed a cachectic man with ecchymoses in different stages disseminated throughout his body and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Labs were significant for serum creatinine of 2.10 mg/dL5, urine microalbumin of 973 ng/dL, urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio of 1624 ng/dL. His urine kappa and lambda light chains were elevated as well. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a large amount of retained fluid in the stomach, which was suctioned and nodular mucosa in the duodenal bulb Duodenal biopsy Congo red stain showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light compatible with amyloidosis. Abdominal fat pad biopsy was also consistent with amyloidosis. He later developed abdominal distension and ileus, which was treated with NG tube decompression. He was planned for empiric treatment for Multiple Myeloma but was lost to follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: There are two common types of amyloid protein: primary amyloid (AL) and inflammtory type (AA). AL is associated with plasma cell disorders like Multiple Myeloma. AA is associated with chronic inflammation like in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Amyloidosis most commonly involves the heart and kidney, while biopsy proven GI involvement is relatively rare. GI biopsy is frequently positive in the duodenum, colorectum, and esophagus. Treatment usually involves treating the underlying condition. Our patient's manifestations of amyloidosis included skin lesions, ileus (global bowel dysfunction), nephropathy, and weight loss. He was presumed to have AL type amyloidosis based on positive urine protein electrophoresis.	false
0	Understanding the Manifestation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients with COVID-19 at Our Tertiary Care Center. INTRODUCTION: The novel SARS-coronavirus (COVID-19) causing the current pandemic has been a threat to human life. According to Johns Hopkins Database, as of June 15, 2020, there have been about 8million cases worldwide with almost 450,000 deaths. Although it presents with fever and respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have also been reported. We will study the manifestation of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in our tertiary care center in Shreveport, Louisiana. METHOD(S): An IRB protocol highlighting a retrospective study was approved. Using electronic health records (EPIC EMR) and the slicer/dicer feature, data from March 1-May 15, 2020 was collected on patient demographics, geography, number of patients with GI symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and liver abnormalities. Inclusion criteria involved adult patients >18yrs of age who were hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Exclusion criteria involved patients < 18yrs and prisoners. RESULT(S): There were 302 adult patients admitted to our hospital who were tested positive for COVID-19 virus. Of all the patients, 57% were female, 43% male; 85% were African American and 11% were Caucasian. About 5.6% of patients had nausea, 11.6% had diarrhea, 8% had vomiting, 8% had constipation and 11.3% had abdominal pain. Liver abnormalities were found in 65.6% of patients. Approximately 26% of the cases were within a 6-mile radius of the hospital. CONCLUSION(S): It is postulated that like the epithelial cells in the airways, the enterocytes in GI tract express ACE2 receptors. This allows for providing entry of the virus in the GI tract, thereby proliferating and excreting in the stool. This study analyzed data from tertiary care center over 6 weeks and found majority of the patients presented with diarrhea and abdominal pain. Racial variation also was highlighted and confirmed the finding of prior studies regarding increased prevalence of COVID-19 in African American populations. Furthermore, approximately a quarter of the cases were found to be in African American populated areas that are within proximity to the hospital. This is likely secondary to poverty, residing in population-dense areas, lack of insurance or access to healthcare and presence of co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Understanding the manifestation of GI symptoms in COVID-19, especially in our population has become increasingly important and for clinicians to remain mindful of such presentation.	false

0	Decreased Incidence of Oncology Admissions in 75 Helios Hospitals in Germany during the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lead to a massive shutdown of social life in Germany starting in March 2020. Elective medical treatment was substantially reduced but urgent diagnostics and treatment including cancer care should not have been affected., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the number of oncology admissions to 75 German Helios hospitals during 2 time periods in 2020 and compared the data with the respective periods in 2019. The study included nearly 69,000 admissions in total., RESULTS: A highly significant reduction in overall cancer admissions was seen for the early lockdown period from 13 March to 28 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. After an official communication advising the health system to return to normal practice on 29 April 2020, we again found a highly significant difference in admissions compared to the respective time in the previous year. Subgroup analysis shows a significant impact of age >75 years, high hospital volume, and intermediate or high COVID-19 case volume in the federal states. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. The effects and significance levels were comparable in nearly all different diagnostic subgroups according to the ICD codes., CONCLUSIONS: For cancer diagnosis and treatment, we found a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions in the range of 10-20% for both study periods in comparison to the previous year.

0	Maintenance of an HCV treatment program in a safety-net health system at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic using a telehealth model. Background: Treatment of hepatitis c virus (HCV) has evolved to include safe and effective all-oral regimens with limited need for in-person monitoring for most patients per recent simplified treatment guidelines by AASLD/IDSA. Despite these guidelines, the majority of patients in our urban, safety-net HCV clinic presented for monthly, in-person follow-up prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19) due to low health literacy rates, social barriers to care, and high prevalence of comorbid disease At the onset of the C-19, we converted to a telehealth HCV treatment model that included couriering medications to patients and conducting telephone visits for patients on treatment We examined three cohorts of patients treated for HCV at different times in relation to C-19 onset: remote from, immediately prior to, and during C-19 to determine the effect of the telehealth treatment model on outcomes including retention in care and treatment completion Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review for patients who initiated treatment one year prior to C-19, 4 months prior to C-19, and for 4 months at the onset of C-19 Charts were reviewed to determine the number of: treatment referrals, patients who initiated treatment, and those who were lost to follow-up Results: Fewer patients were referred for HCV treatment during C-19: there were 60 referrals over 4 months versus 133 during both of the pre- COVID time periods Also, fewer patients started treatment during C-19: 75 patients, including some who were previously referred but whose treatment was delayed, versus over one hundred patients during both of the pre-C-19 time periods Of the patients who initiated treatment, 7/149 (5%) were lost to follow-up in the time period one year prior to COVID, 14/104 (13%) were lost to follow-up 4 months before C-19 and 6/75 (8%) were lost to follow-up during C-19 Conclusion(s): C-19 resulted in fewer patients referred to HCV treatment This was an expected outcome due to a hold on starting new patients on treatment during the first 2 months of C-19. The majority of patients who initiated treatment during C-19 remained on treatment despite transitioning from an all in person monitoring model to a completely telehealth model This retention in care rate is encouraging and supports the use of telehealth for HCV treatment visits going forward in a patient population with low health literary and social barriers to care Further study is needed to see how treatment completion and SVR rates will be impacted.	false
0	Natural and human environment interactively drive spread pattern of COVID-19: A city-level modeling study in China. A novel Coronavirus COVID-19 has caused high morbidity and mortality in China and worldwide. A few studies have explored the impact of climate change or human activity on the disease incidence in China or a city. The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector; the impact of effective factors and interaction terms on COVID-19 is simulated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results find that mean temperature (MeanT), destination proportion in population flow from Wuhan (WH), migration scale (MS), and WH*MeanT, are generally promoting for COVID-19 incidence before Wuhan's shutdown (T1); the WH and MeanT play a determinant role in the disease spread in T1. The effect of environment on COVID-19 incidence after Wuhan's shutdown (T2) includes more factors (including mean DEM, relative humidity, precipitation (Pre), travel intensity within a city (TC), and their interactive terms) than T1, and their effect shows distinct spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, the dividing line of positive-negative effect of MeanT and Pre on COVID-19 incidence is 8.5degreeC and 1 mm, respectively. In T2, WH has weak impact, but the MS has the strongest effect. The COVID-19 incidence in T2 without quarantine is also modeled using the developed GWR model, and the modeled incidence shows an obvious increase for 75.6% cities compared with reported incidence in T2 especially for some mega cities. This evidences national quarantine and traffic control take determinant role in controlling the disease spread. The study indicates that both natural environment and human factors integratedly affect the spread pattern of COVID-19 in China. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Role of serum albumin and proteinuria in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia is frequently observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection although its underlying mechanism and relationship with clinical outcome still need to be clarified., METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, its association with the severity of COVID-19, with the levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer and interleukin-6 and with clinical outcome over a follow-up period of 30 days. Urinalysis was evaluated in a subgroup of patients., RESULTS: Serum albumin levels < 30 g/L were found in 105/207 (50.7%) patients at hospital admission. Overall, the median albumin value was 29.5 g/L (IQR 25-32.8). A negative association was found between albumin levels and severity of COVID-19 (p<0.0001) and death (p=0.003). An inverse correlation was observed between albumin and both C-reactive protein and D-dimer at hospital admission (r = -0.487 and r = -0.479, respectively; p< 0.0001). Finally, a positive correlation was found between albumin levels and eGFR (r= 0.137; p=0.049). Proteinuria was observed in 75% of patients with available data and it did not differ between patients with hypoalbuminemia and those with albumin >= 30 g/L (81% and 67%, respectively; p=0.09)., CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 hypoalbuminemia is common and observed in quite an early stage of pulmonary disease. It is strictly associated with inflammation markers and clinical outcome. The common finding of proteinuria, even in the absence of creatinine increase, indicates protein loss as a possible biomarker of local and systemic inflammation worthwhile to evaluate disease severity in COVID-19.

0	Pediatric Ischemic Stroke: An Infrequent Complication of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: Severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of pediatric strokes with SARS-CoV-2 in the first three months of the pandemic in an international cohort., METHODS: We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (<=18 years) SARS-CoV-2 patients; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric stroke patients; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 March 1-May 31, 2020., RESULTS: Of 42 centers with SAR-CoV-2 hospitalization numbers, 8/971 (0.82%) with SARS-CoV-2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March-May 2020 were: 1/108 neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0/33 neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6/166 childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1/54 childhood CSVT (1.9%) cases. However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9%, 0%, 6.1%, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS-CoV-2. Seven of eight with SARS-CoV-2 had additional established stroke risk factors., INTERPRETATION: As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 4.7% of pediatric ischemic stroke patients tested. However, <50% of strokes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered in pediatric stroke patients as the pandemic continues to determine SARS-CoV-2's role in pediatric stroke.

0	Mortality-Prevalence Ratio - a novel index evaluating potentially undocumented COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of COVID-19 has caused 200 thousand death-cases since early 2020. The corresponding mortality rate among different countries and time varies., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 within a country., METHODS: We collected data from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which included daily cumulative death count, recovered count, and confirmed count for each country. This study focuses on a total of 36 countries with over 10,000 confirmed cases. Mortality is the main outcome and dependent variable, which is computed as the number of COVID-19 deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases., RESULTS: The result of global panel regression showed that there was a highly significant correlation between prevalence and mortality (Spearmans^' correlation=0.8304). We found that every increment of one confirmed case in a thousand individuals leaded to 1.29268% increment in mortality after controlling country-specific baseline mortality and time-fixed effects. Over 70% of excess mortality could be explained by prevalence, and the heterogeneity among countries' mortality to prevalence (MP) ratio was significant. We further showed that China had an abnormally high and significant MP ratio compared to other countries. This unusual deviation of MP ratio disappeared with the removal of data from China collected after February 17th. It is worth noting that the prevalence of a disease relies on accurate diagnosis and comprehensive surveillance, which could be difficult to achieve due to practical or political concerns., CONCLUSIONS: The mortality-prevalence association was observed and being quantified as MP ratio. Our results highlight the significance of constraining disease transmission on decreasing mortality. Comparison of MP ratio among countries can be powerful in detecting or even quantifying the proportion of undocumented infected individuals., CLINICALTRIAL:	false

0	Pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 have increased composite morbidity compared with nonpregnant matched controls. Background: In March 2020, as community spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 became increasingly prevalent, pregnant women seemed to be equally susceptible to developing coronavirus disease 2019. Although the disease course usually appears mild, severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 seem to lead to substantial morbidity, including intensive care unit admission with prolonged hospital stay, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and even death. Although there are recent reports regarding the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy, there is a lack of information regarding the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant vs nonpregnant women. Objective(s): We aimed to describe the outcomes of severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant vs nonpregnant, reproductive-aged women. Study Design: This is a multicenter, retrospective, case-control study of women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection hospitalized with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in 4 academic medical centers in New York City and 1 in Philadelphia between March 12, 2020, and May 5, 2020. The cases consisted of pregnant women admitted specifically for severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 and not for obstetrical indications. The controls consisted of reproductive-aged, nonpregnant women admitted for severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. The primary outcome was a composite morbidity that includes the following: death, a need for intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or a need for high-flow nasal cannula O2 supplementation. The secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission, length of stay, a need for discharge to long-term acute care facilities, and discharge with a home O2 requirement. Result(s): A total of 38 pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed infections were admitted to 5 institutions specifically for coronavirus disease 2019, 29 (76.3%) meeting the criteria for severe disease status and 9 (23.7%) meeting the criteria for critical disease status. The mean age and body mass index were markedly higher in the nonpregnant control group. The nonpregnant cohort also had an increased frequency of preexisting medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The pregnant women were more likely to experience the primary outcome when compared with the nonpregnant control group (34.2% vs 14.9%; P=.03; adjusted odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-18.2). The pregnant patients experienced higher rates of intensive care unit admission (39.5% vs 17.0%; P<.01; adjusted odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-17.5). Among the pregnant women who underwent delivery, 72.7% occurred through cesarean delivery and the mean gestational age at delivery was 33.8+/-5.5 weeks in patients with severe disease status and 35+/-3.5 weeks in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 status. Conclusion(s): Pregnant women with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 are at an increased risk for certain morbidities when compared with nonpregnant controls. Despite the higher comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension in the nonpregnant controls, the pregnant cases were at an increased risk for composite morbidity, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be associated with a worse outcome in women with severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Our study suggests that similar to other viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pregnant women may be at risk for greater morbidity and disease severity.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Assessment of Contraceptive Use in Puerto Rico during the 2016 Zika Virus Outbreak. Of states and territories in the United States, Puerto Rico was the most severely affected by the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in 2016. A large number of studies have shown that infection of pregnant women with ZIKV can result in microcephaly, structural abnormalities of the brain and eye, and other severe birth defects. It was estimated that during the initial ZIKVoutbreak in Puerto Rico in 2016 up to 10,300 pregnant women would be infected and that, in the absence of preventivemeasures, 100 to 270 infants would be born with microcephaly. Given the lack of a vaccine or prophylacticmedication to prevent ZIKV infection in areas with this virus, effective contraception for women who want to avoid pregnancy is critical for prevention of ZIKV-associated fetal and infant outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended in 2016 that women of reproductive age who do not want to become pregnant and have had or anticipate ZIKV exposure should use the most effective contraceptive method available. The aims of this population-based survey were to estimate the prevalence of contraceptive use among women at risk of unintended pregnancy in Puerto Rico and identify correlates of contraceptive use among women with ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services during the 2016 ZIKV outbreak. A cell-phone survey was conducted between July and November 2016. Eligible participants were women aged 18 to 49 years living in Puerto Rico at the time of the interview. Among 3059 respondents who met eligibility criteria and completed the interview, the overall response rate was 69.2%. Weighted population-based prevalence estimates (using raking methodology) were calculated for overall contraceptive use among women at risk of unintended pregnancy and by contraceptivemethod type and age.Women at risk of unintended pregnancy included in this analysis were assessed for their ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services. Those who used permanent contraceptive methods were excluded. Most women at risk of unintended pregnancy reported using contraception (82.8%), and use increased with age. The most frequently reported contraceptive method among women was sterilization (40.8%) and in men was condoms (17.1%). Only one-quarter (24.7%) of women had ever talked to a health care provider about ZIKV, and 31.2% reported a change in childbearing intentions because of ZIKV.Most women were a little worried about getting infected with ZIKV (74.3%) or having a baby with a birth defect (80.9%), and 4.3%reported they were already infected. The only factors significantly associated with any contraception use were being very worried (compared to not being worried) about getting infected with ZIKV (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.38) or reporting already having ZIKV (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.72). These findings highlight the need for regular contraceptive prevalence studies to inform programs about needs of women for regular use of contraceptives, especially during public health emergencies, such as ZIKV. The data provide ongoing contraceptive prevalence estimates that can help decision makers understand how limited contraceptive use and gaps in contraceptive access, especially during public health emergencies, impact pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Dysregulation of immune response in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Background. In December 2019, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. Methods. Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from 10 January to 12 February 2020 were collected and analyzed. The data on laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between patients with severe and nonsevere infection. Results. Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as having severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocyte counts, higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and were more impaired in severe cases. Both helper T (Th) cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, with lower levels of Th cells in the severe group. The percentage of naive Th cells increased and memory Th cells decreased in severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower levels of regulatory T cells, which are more obviously decreased in severe cases. Conclusions. The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Importance of coronavirus disease 2019 screening before endoscopic procedures. INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated to be between 15 to 40% of all cases. This needs to be distinguished from pre-symptomatic disease as patients are asymptomatic for a while, but eventually have symptoms. Since COVID-19 patients are contagious while asymptomatic, healthcare providers are at high risk of exposure. Although mass testing may prevent healthcare worker exposure, mass testing may not be possible due to insufficient healthcare resources. To illuminate the importance of COVID-19 screening, we present a 66 year-old asymptomatic male with a COVID-19 positive screen before an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 66 year-old African American non-Hispanic male with a past medical history of ischemic stroke, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, presented to the emergency department with bright red blood per rectum and melenic stool. He denied any fever, chills, night sweats, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. His bleeding began one week after starting apixaban for a left internal jugular vein thrombosis. Initial laboratory was significant for a microcytic anemia (11.2 g/dL). Therefore, he was admitted for further evaluation of gastrointestinal bleed. Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended proceeding with an EGD. However, recent hospital guidelines warranted COVID-19 screening in all patients undergoing a procedure. Although the patient had asymptomatic respiratory symptoms, he tested positive for COVID-19. Therefore, endoscopy was cancelled. Once serial hemoglobin was stable, he was discharged after two days of hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Healthcare workers are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. In an observational study enrolling 1,099 Chinese patients infected with COVID-19, 3.5% were healthcare workers. Gastroenterologists are at high risk of infection as some procedures create viral aerosolization. However, pre-endoscopic and nationwide screening could decrease infection rate. South Korea successfully contained COVID-19 spread through mass testing. Although such solution could be implemented in the United States, insufficient healthcare utilization of resources including limited tests and reagent supplies are potential hurdles. We present the importance of COVID-19 screening before endoscopy. Although the long-term benefits of pre-endoscopic COVID-19 screening is not well known, pre-endoscopic screening may be an effective way to limit healthcare worker exposure.	false
0	Implications of tocilizumab-based COVID-19 treatment on liver function tests: A one-month retrospective analysis of unprecedented tocilizumab use during the peak of the SARSCOV-2 pandemic in New York. INTRODUCTION: In addition to potentially fatal lung injury, SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and elevated liver related tests (LRTs). It is unclear if GI pathology and liver injury is related to direct Covid-19 viral effects, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, a systemic inflammatory response, or a complicated disease course. Our retrospective study aimed to assess the effects of Tocilizumab (TCZ) on GI symptoms, LRTs, and coagulation factors in COVID- 19 patients hospitalized during April, 2020. Additionally, we evaluated how many patients had viral hepatitis screening (VHS) prior to receiving TCZ. METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review was conducted, evaluating for the prevalence of vomiting and diarrhea, VHS, and changes in LRTs and coagulation panels in all COVID-19 patients admitted during April 2020. These variables were assessed before and after TCZ. RESULT(S): TCZ was given to 69 patients. LFTs increased after TCZ (before vs after treatment: AST 65.56 u/L+/-49.18 u/L vs 102.94 u/L+/-102.56u/L, P < 0.01 95 % CI; ALT 71.73u/L+/-50.5u/L vs 94.14u/L+/-128.20u/L, P < 0.01 95 % CI; ALP 104.85u/L 656.91u/L vs 113.76u/L+/-68.92u/L, P < 0.01 95% CI). Patients showed significant improvement in Total bilirubin (TB) (before: 0.64mg/dL+/-0.42mg/dL vs after: 0.62mg/dL 60.31 mg/dL, P < 0.01 95 % CI). Patient coagulation factors increased after the treatment (before vs after: PT 14.03 secs+/-1.13 secs vs 16.03 secs+/-2.5 secs, P < 0.01 95% CI; INR 1.07+/-0.01 vs 1.27+/-0.26, P < 0.01 95% CI). Only 36% of patients had VHS prior to receiving TCZ. Although not statistically significant, 19% of patients reported vomiting and diarrhea prior to TCZ, 38% of whom reported symptom resolution after treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Faced with a novel disease, of lethal and pandemic proportions, many physicians quickly adopted TCZ for off-label use to combat COVID-19. This decision was based on promising, yet small observational studies; our evidence base was limited. In our study, TCZ use was associated with an increase in ALT, AST, and PT and a decrease in TB. However, it is difficult to assess whether this rise in ALT is due to the disease process or a consequence of TCZ itself; TCZ is known to increase ALT in up to 6% of patients using TCZ. Furthermore, only 36% of patients had VHS prior to initiating therapy, an important consideration given possible Hepatitis reactivation. Further evaluation with a control group and larger sample size is warranted to continue to assess the potential implications of TCZ use.	false
0	Effect of gastric acid suppression in gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to over 5 million cases and 340,000 deaths globally as of May 2020. There are increasing reports of gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain suggestive of gastrointestinal infection by COVID-19. In vitro studies developed for the safe handling of the COVID-19 virus have reported inactivation of coronavirus in highly acidic conditions (pH < 3) such as the human stomach which has a pH range between 1.0 to 3.5. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and H2 receptor blocker (H2B) medications are ubiquitous in clinical practice and have been shown to be highly effective in raising intragastric pH. We hypothesize that acid-suppressing medications taken prior to COVID-19 infection lead to increased gastrointestinal symptoms due to altered gastric pH potentially influencing viral load. METHOD(S): This was a single center retrospective cohort study. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted from March to April 2020 were identified and charts were reviewed for patient demographics, outpatient medication list, symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and hospital course. The primary outcome was prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea) between the acid-suppressed patients and non-acid-suppressed patients. Secondary outcomes compared need for intensive care, length of stay, and mortality. RESULT(S): We reviewed 100 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19. Twenty-four patients were taking acid-reducing medications prior to admission. There were more females in the acidsuppressed group (41.7%) compared to the non-acid-suppressed group (34.2%) and average age was approximately 59 years for both (Table 1). Overall, GI symptoms occurred in 33.3% of acidsuppressed patients and 34.2% of the non-acid suppressed patients (P = 0.937) (Figure 1). No significant differences in specific GI symptoms were observed between the groups. Need for intensive care, length of stay, and mortality did not differ (Table 1). CONCLUSION(S): While in vitro studies suggest a potential deleterious effect for patients taking acidsuppressive medications prior to COVID-19 infections, no association was noted in gastrointestinal symptoms, acuity of care, length of stay, or mortality in patients taking PPI or H2 blocker medications prior to admission for COVID-19 infection in our cohort.

0	Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with covid-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is now a critical threat to global public health. Although, the majority of patients present with respiratory illness, several studies have described multi-organ involvement. The purpose of this study was to report liver enzyme test results in COVID-19 patients on admission and their association with clinical outcomes. METHOD(S): This study was a single-center retrospective analysis of all in-patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Demographic, clinical factors, and liver enzyme tests including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were noted from the time of admission. Association of liver enzyme elevation with clinical outcomes such as inpatient death need for intubation and vasopressor use was determined using chi-square test and multivariate regression analysis. RESULT(S): Among 200 patients, AST elevation was seen in 55% and ALT elevation in 20% of patients. AST elevation was associated with in-patient death OR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05) P=0.035, need for vasopressors CI 1.034 (95% CI 1.015-1.055) P=0.001 and intubation OR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05) P=0.002. AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was seen in 34% of patients and was associated with the need for intubation OR 2.678 95% CI [1.202-5.963] P=0.016 and need for vasopressors OR 3.352 95% CI [1.495-7.514]. CONCLUSION(S): Serum aminotransferase levels are useful markers of hepatocellular injury. Patients with elevated AST, AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease as evidence by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient death. These patients should be monitored closely given the propensity for severe disease.	false
0	Forecasting Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 in India Under Containment Measures- A Time-Dependent State-Space SIR Approach. The primary objective of this paper is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India while adjusting for the effects of various progressively implemented containment measures. Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. This paper proposes a method based on time-series SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Removed) model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate the basic reproduction number R-0 and expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R-0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period. Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R-0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R-0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious period.	false
0	High Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients with Cancer. INTRODUCTION: Patients with COVID-19 most commonly present with fever, dry cough, myalgia, or fatigue; however, the disease may progress rapidly to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have also been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data on the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms in patients with cancer are limited. We sought to characterize the GI manifestations of COVID-19 in oncology patients. Method(s): We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 9 Massachusetts medical centers and identified those with an active malignancy. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, as well as their disease severity and clinical outcomes. Result(s): Of 395 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (9%) had an active malignancy. Of the 36 cancer patients, 23 (63%) reported >=1 new GI symptom. The most prevalent symptoms were anorexia (12, 52%), diarrhea (9, 39%), and vomiting (8; 35%). GI symptoms were the initial symptom in 4 (11%) patients, the predominant symptom in 5 (14%) patients, and were severe in 4 (17%) patients. Four of 5 patients with GI symptoms at presentation reported concurrent fever, notably 1 patient had no fever or respiratory symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients had elevations in liver trans-aminases at presentation. Patients with elevated transaminases were more likely to have associated GI symptoms (83 vs 54%, P = 0.04) (Table 1). COVID-related GI symptoms were seen in 73% of patients on active treatment as compared with 52% of patients who were not on active treatment. However, these results were not statistically significant. There were no differences in the incidence of GI symptoms on COVID-19 based on the specific treatment modality (Table 2). Conclusion(s): Acute GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 are highly prevalent in hospitalized cancer patients and can occur as a presenting symptom without respiratory symptoms. Symptoms are severe in a small subset of patients. Fever was not a universal symptom in our cohort of cancer patients. Increased awareness of GI symptoms as a manifestation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer may provide opportunities for early identification and management.	false
0	The Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating global impact and is a critical area of study for medical professionals. Characterization of the disease is important to assist in developing screening protocols and diagnostic tools. Studies have shown that similar to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 virus has a tropism for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The mechanism of COVID-induced GI symptoms is unknown, though direct viral infection of enterocytes and immunemediated injury have been hypothesized. This study evaluated the prevalence of GI symptoms and the frequency at which these symptoms were the initial presentation in hospitalized COVID patients. METHOD(S): A confidential database was created from a registry of patients admitted to an urban university hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite were identified. A frequency analysis using SAS was performed to determine prevalence of GI symptoms and timing of presentation. The study was IRB approved. RESULT(S): 283 patients were analyzed, with 37.46% having at least one GI symptom prior to admission to the hospital. The most common symptom was nausea/vomiting (33.92%) followed by diarrhea (19.08%), loss of appetite (13.07%), and abdominal pain (3.53%). Two or more symptoms were seen in 13.43% of patients. GI symptoms were cited as the initial presentation in 23.32% of cases. Diarrhea was the most common initial symptom (11.66%) followed by nausea/vomiting (9.19%), loss of appetite (9.19%), and abdominal pain (2.47%). Multiple GI symptoms occurred as the initial presentation in 7.06% of patients. CONCLUSION(S): Gastrointestinal symptoms are an important presentation of COVID-19 that is often overlooked. Increased awareness and characterization of GI symptoms in COVID-19 infection is needed to improve screening procedures and protect healthcare workers from potential fecal-oral transmission. While diarrhea in COVID-19 infection has become the primary GI focus, this study revealed that nausea/vomiting occurred in one-third of hospitalized patients. These results are important because they offer important information about the spectrum of GI manifestations in a diverse U.S. urban population.	false
0	Clinical Findings of COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Units in Guangdong Province, China: A Multicenter, Retrospective, Observational Study. Background: Information about critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China but outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Method(s): In this multicenter, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to seven ICUs in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Result(s): A total of 45 COVID-19 patients required ICU admission in the study hospitals [mean age 56.7 +/- 15.4 years, 29 males (64.4%)]. The most common symptoms at onset were fever and cough. Most patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all patients. Thirty-six patients (80%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome at ICU admission, and 15 (33.3%) septic shock. Twenty patients (44.4%) were intubated, and 10 (22.2%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The 60-day mortality was 4.4% (2 of 45). Conclusion(s): COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction. The mortality of ICU patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low with a small sample size.© Copyright © 2020 Xu, Xu, Liu, Cai, Zheng, Huang, Zhou, Huang, Ling, Deng, Li, Chen, Liu, Lin, Zhou, He, Zhong, Liu and Li.	false
0	Elevated D-dimers useful prediction of pulmonary artery thrombosis in COVID-19 Patients at initial presentation to Hospital. Background: Elevated d-dimers in COVID-19 patients are associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality. However, they have not been used consistently to identify patients for evaluation of concurrent pulmonary artery thrombosis (PAT). Aim(s): To evaluate the prevalence of PAT in COVID-19 patients attending the emergency department (ED), and investigate d-dimer cut-offs for diagnosis through computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Method(s): This retrospective review included 685 COVID-19 positive patients. D-dimers were performed in 512 patients, 89 had CTPA, and 82 had both within 48 hrs of admission. Result(s): PAT was detected in 42% (37/89) of patients who had a CTPA within 48 hrs of admission. In the group with CTPA and d-dimers (n = 82) receiver operator characteristic analysis demonstrated that d-dimers were good for predicting PAT (AUC of 0.78, P < 0.0001). A d-dimer cut-off of 2000 ng/mL had a 87.5% sensitivity, with 83.3% negative predictive value for PAT detection. In this group, 71% of patients had a d-dimer > 2000 ng/mL with almost half of them having a positive scan. Implementing this cut-off across the cohort with d-dimer results only (n = 430) would require nearly a third of the COVID-19 patients to have CTPA. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest a significant prevalence of PAT in patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation. Due to the significant overlap of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 with that of PAT, it is difficult to select patients for CTPA based on the clinical presentation alone. Locally agreed d-dimer cut-offs can be used to guide the need for CTPA.	false
0	Existing drug treatments cannot significantly shorten the clinical cure time of children with COVID-19. Introduction: COVID-19 has become a global health security issue, it has caused more than half a million deaths worldwide so far, the treatment strategies are the most concerned issues for clinicians. In this study, the treatments and outcomes in 40 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with different drugs were evaluated. Methodology: All cases were diagnosed with COVID-19 nucleic acid positive by using RT-PCR or clinical manifestations, imaging specific characteristics and epidemiological clinical diagnosis. The biological information and first symptom of all cases were collect. A variety of treatments were employed and the outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate cure rate at 14 days with different drug treatment. Result(s): The average length of hospital stay was 10.4 days. The cure rate was increased with the treatment time extended and 90% of pediatric patients were cured and discharged after 14 days' treatment. And multivariable analysis results proved that none of the covariates were related to the cure rate at 14 days with different drug treatment since p values were over 0.05. Conclusion(s): Multivariable analysis suggested that the present drug treatments cannot significantly shorten the clinical cure time and improve the cure rate of children with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Li et al.	false
0	Treatment gaps and challenges in epilepsy care in the Philippines. OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a neurologic disease that carries a high disease burden and likely, a huge treatment gap especially in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC) such as the Philippines. This review aimed to examine the treatment gaps and challenges that burden Philippine epilepsy care., MATERIALS & METHODS: Pertinent data on epidemiology, research, health financing and health systems, pharmacologic and surgical treatment options, cost of care, and workforce were obtained through a literature search and review of relevant Philippine government websites., RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in the Philippines is 0.9%. Epilepsy research in the Philippines is low in quantity compared with the rest of Southeast Asia (SEA). Inequities in quality and quantity of healthcare services delivered to local government units (LGUs) have arisen because of devolution. Programs for epilepsy care by both government and nongovernment institutions have been implemented. Healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is still largely out-of-pocket, with only partial coverage from the public sector. There is limited access to antiseizure medications (ASMs), mainly due to cost. Epilepsy surgery is an underutilized treatment option. There are only 20 epileptologists in the Philippines, with one epileptologist for every 45,000 patients with epilepsy. In addition, epilepsy care service delivery has been further impeded by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., CONCLUSION: There is a large treatment gap in epilepsy care in the Philippines in terms of high epilepsy disease burden, socioeconomic limitations and inadequate public support, sparse clinico-epidemiologic research on epilepsy, inaccessibility of health care services and essential pharmacotherapy, underutilization of surgical options, and lack of specialists capable of rendering epilepsy care. Acknowledgment of the existence of these treatment gaps and addressing such are expected to improve the overall survival and quality of life of patients with epilepsy in the Philippines.

0	Drivers of acceptance of COVID-19 proximity tracing apps in Switzerland: a panel survey analysis. BACKGROUND: Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps have been released to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. But it remains unclear how their acceptance and uptake can be improved., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate SwissCovid app coverage and reasons for not using the app in Switzerland during a time of increasing SARS-CoV-2 incidence., METHODS: By use of data collected between 28.09.2020 to 08.10.2020 for a nationwide online panel survey (Covid-19 Social Monitor, n=1'511 participants), socio-demographic and behavioral factors associated with app usage were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Reasons for app non-use were analyzed descriptively., RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% of participants reported using the SwissCovid app (up from 43.9% in a study wave conducted in July 2020). A higher monthly household income (e.g., OR 1.92 [1.40-2.64] for an income >CHF 10'000 vs. an income <= CHF 6'000), more frequent internet use (e.g., daily (reference) vs. less than weekly OR 0.37 [0.16-0.85]), better adherence to mask-wearing recommendations (e.g., always or most of the time (reference) vs. rarely or never OR 0.28 [0.15-0.52]), and being a non-smoker (OR 1.32 [1.01-1.71]) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (e.g., non-Swiss citizenship 0.61 [0.43-0.87] vs. Swiss citizenship only), and language region (French 0.61 [0.46-0.80], vs. Swiss German) were associated with a lower app uptake probability. In a randomly selected subsample (n=711) with more detailed information, higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were additionally associated with a higher app uptake probability (e.g., OR 3.13 [1.58-6.22] for high vs. low trust (reference)). The most frequent reasons for app non-use was lack of perceived benefit of the app (36.8%), 22.8% reported having no compatible phone, and 22.4% had privacy concerns., CONCLUSIONS: Removing technical hurdles and communicating the benefits of DPT-apps are crucial to promote further uptake, adherence, and ultimately to enhance effectiveness of DPT-apps for pandemic mitigation.	false
0	Effect of Artificial Liver Blood Purification Treatment on the Survival of Critical Ill COVID-19 Patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of artificial liver blood purification treatment on the survival of severe/critical patients with COVID-19., METHODS: A total of 101 severe and critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in this open, case-control, multicentre, prospective study. According to the patients' and their families' willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment, while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment. Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28-day mortality rate, were collected and analysed., RESULTS: This study involved 101 severe/critical patients with COVID-19, among which 50 were in the treatment group and 51 were in the control group. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre-treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices et al. showed no difference between the two groups. Cytokine storm was detected, with a significant increase of serum IL-6 level. The serum IL-6 level decreased from 119.94 pg/mL to 20.49 pg/mL in the treatment group and increased from 40.42 pg/mL to 50.81 pg/mL in the control group (p<0.05), indicating that artificial liver therapy significantly decreased serum IL-6. The median duration of viral nucleic acid persistence was 19 days in the treatment group (ranging from 6-67 days) and 17 days in the control group (ranging from 3-68 days), no significant difference was observed (p=0.36). As of 28-day follow-up,17 patients in the treatment group experienced a median weaning time of 24 days, while 11 patients in the control group experienced a median weaning time of 35 days, with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.33). The 28-day mortality rates were 16% (8/50) in the treatment group and 50.98% (26/51) in the control group, with a significant difference (z=3.70, p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Cytokine storm is a key factor in the intensification of COVID-19 pneumonia. The artificial liver therapy blocks the cytokine storm by clearing inflammatory mediators, thus preventing severe cases from progressing to critically ill stages and markedly reducing short-term mortality.

0	MM-239: A Tertiary Center Experience of Multiple Myeloma Patients with COVID-19: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward. Context: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the United States. Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. Objective(s): We explored the population of myeloma patients who developed COVID-19 to identify risk factors tied to poor outcomes. Design(s): We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Setting(s): A large tertiary care cancer center in New York at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Patient(s): Patient charts were analyzed retrospectively. Patients had MM or SMM and COVID-19. Result(s): Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male, and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex, and cardiovascular risk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusion(s): Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on patient outcome. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes of myeloma patients in future outbreaks of COVID-19. The majority of myeloma patients mounted a specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Diffuse gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to COVID-19 macrophage activation syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection common, but usually mild in severity. We describe a case of severe gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in a patient with a COVID-19 associated hyperinflammatory response. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 25-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with 2 weeks of fevers, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. He tested positive for COVID-19 on nasopharyngeal PCR and imaging showed multifocal pneumonia. Initial labs were notable for markedly elevated CRP and ferritin, pancytopenia and acute kidney injury. He was treated for suspected COVID-19 associated hyperinflammatory syndrome with anakinra (5 mg/kg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine. He became anuric requiring hemodialysis and renal biopsy complicated by retroperitoneal bleeding and emergent embolization of the left renal artery. He was intubated for worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and developed hematemesis and melena leading to hemorrhagic shock. EGD showed diffuse inflammation, erosions and oozing from the esophagus to the proximal duodenum, non-bleeding gastric ulcers and petechiae (Figure 1A, B). Given clinical suspicion for COVID-19 associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/ secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), anakinra was restarted and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 1mg/kg) was given with clinical improvement. The patient continued to have melena. Repeat EGD showed severe esophagitis with large clots and sloughing mucosa, a focal 3-4 cm area of necrosis in the fundus, unresolved non-bleeding stomach ulcers and improved duodenitis from prior (Figure 1C, D). DISCUSSION: We describe a case of a young adult who developed catastrophic GIB as a complication of COVID-19. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection is incompletely understood, but there is mounting evidence that it can induce a MAS/sHLH-like hyperinflammatory response. Several laboratory hallmarks of COVID-19 infection are also seen in MAS/sHLH including elevated CRP, ferritin, IL-1, and IL-6. This hyperinflammatory response can manifest in a variety of ways, including a Kawasaki-like presentation in pediatric patients responsive to IVIG and IL-1 antagonism. GIB is rare in COVID-19, occurring in 4% of cases, but can occur in up to 20% of MAS/sHLH cases. Clinicians should recognize that COVID-19 can provoke a MAS/sHLH-like hyperinflammatory syndrome with gastrointestinal involvement.	false
0	A rare case of acute liver failure in suspected catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare syndrome which presents as system wide thrombotic events that leads to eventual multi organ failure. Acute liver failure is less commonly seen in patients with CAPS. We present a rare case of a 48 year old female with suspected CAPS who developed acute liver failure. This patient tested positive for COVID-19 infection, which likely triggered CAPS. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 48 year old female with a history of CAD and hypertension presented to the hospital after being found by her husband at home to be unresponsive. She reported a 1 week history of decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting. Labs on admission were significant for: PT 13.9s, BUN 23, Cr 2.16, TB 12.6, DB 9.59, ALP 321, ALT 2480, AST 3320. Labs three months prior to admission were normal. Hepatitis A and B, EBV serologies, ANA, ASMA, total IgG/IgM levels were negative. Liver doppler was negative for thrombosis. COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. Her hospital course was complicated by multi organ failure as well as coagulopathy. Arterial doppler of the lower extremities showed an occluded right sided anterior tibial artery. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) antibody was negative however a PTT-LA antibody was positive. Liver biopsy showed extensive non-inflammatory centrilobular necrosis, patchy portal based mononuclear infiltrates suggestive of ischemic or toxic mediated injury secondary to drug or viral infection. Subsequently, she went into acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and respiratory failure requiring intubation. Given the above findings, she was diagnosed with suspected CAPS. DISCUSSION: CAPS is diagnosed in patients with sudden onset of multiorgan failure with presence of at least one venous, arterial or small vessel thrombosis in any organ with a positive antibody (ie LA, anti- cardiolipin or anti-beta glycoprotein I antibody). PTT-LA antibody has been reported to be a weak reagent for the LA antibody. A positive PTT-LA antibody can imply that symptoms are due to a partial presence of the LA antibody. We found no other cause for her multiorgan failure and given above findings, she was diagnosed with probable CAPS. Although COVID-19 has been shown to cause elevation of liver enzymes in the literature, the degree of liver enzyme elevation as seen in our patient has not been reported.	false
0	Virulence and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques: A nonhuman primate model of COVID-19 progression. The COVID-19 has emerged as an epidemic, causing severe pneumonia with a high infection rate globally. To better understand the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2, we developed a rhesus macaque model to mimic natural infection via the nasal route, resulting in the SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in the nose and stool up to 27 days. Importantly, we observed the pathological progression of marked interstitial pneumonia in the infected animals on 5-7 dpi, with virus dissemination widely occurring in the lower respiratory tract and lymph nodes, and viral RNA was consistently detected from 5 to 21 dpi. During the infection period, the kinetics response of T cells was revealed to contribute to COVID-19 progression. Our findings implied that the antiviral response of T cells was suppressed after 3 days post infection, which might be related to increases in the Treg cell population in PBMCs. Moreover, two waves of the enhanced production of cytokines (TGF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL- 10, IL-15, IL-1beta), chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, and MIP-1beta/CCL4) were detected in lung tissue. Our data collected from this model suggested that T cell response and cytokine/chemokine changes in lung should be considered as evaluation parameters for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development, besides of observation of virus shedding and pathological analysis.Copyright © 2020 Zheng et al.

0	Liver injury in a patient with acute hepatitis b and sars-COV-2 co-infection: A case report. INTRODUCTION: Liver injury in patients with COVID 19 have been described with an incidence of 14.8%-78% and characterized by elevated AST and ALT levels. Here we present a case of a man that presented with acute liver injury found to acute HBV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 33 year-old-man presented with jaundice, subjective fever and malaise for 5 days. Physical exam showed jaundice, not hypoxic, hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Investigations on admission AST 2607 U/L, ALT 1187 U/L, TB 27.2 mg/dL (58.2 mg/dL on day 5), GGT 332 U/L, INR 1.49. IgManti-HBc reactive, HBeAg non-reactive, Anti-HBs Non-reactive, HBV viral load 920000 IU/mL. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-COV-2 RNA PCR was positive. LDH 1026 U/L, CRP 8.0 mg/L, Ferritin 27,775 ng/ml, D-Dimer: 286 ng/dL. Absolute lymphocyte count 1.90 103/cumm. CT abdomen minimal periportal edema with periportal lymphadenopathy. Tenofovir 300 mg/day for 2 days was given, then switched to Entecavir 0.5 mg/day. He received Acetylcysteine infusion 100 mg/kg for 5 days. On discharge AST 390 U/L, ALT 958 U/L, TB 43.8 mg/dL, INR 1.09. He didn't develop respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: This case rose the question of the interaction between the two viruses and the appropriate treatment in HBV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. In a study patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to have HBV than non-severe cases (2.4% vs 0.6%), it has been proposed that there could be an enhancement of viral replication of HBV due to SARS-CoV-2, and that SARSCoV-2 may directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes causing hepatic injury. A CRP >20mg/ L and lymphopenia , 1.1 103/cumm have been independently associated with liver injury in COVID-19, in most studies liver dysfunction appears to be mild and transient. Highly elevated AST and ALT are more commonly seen with HBV, in COVID-19 the median levels of AST and ALT haven been 47 U/L. The above suggested liver injury was mediated by HBV, we did not administer any treatment targeting COVID-19. Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 promotes/enhances HBV replication needs to be further studied. In the setting of emergent COVID-19 its challenging to treat patients presenting like ours given the increasing number of non-respiratory manifestation of the disease, the decision to give treatment for SARS-CoV-2 can be puzzling. Here we have presented a patient with acute HBV and co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 that improved without administering any COVID-19 specific therapy.	false
0	Atrial fibrillation and the risk of 30-day incident thromboembolic events, and mortality in adults >= 50 years with COVID-19. Background: There are limited data on the outcomes of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and atrial fibrillation (AF). The objectives were to (i) examine associations between AF, 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with COVID-19 and (ii) examine associations between COVID-19, 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with AF. Method(s): A study was conducted using a global federated health research network. Adults aged >=50 years who presented to 41 participating healthcare organizations between 20 January 2020 and 1 September 2020 with COVID-19 were included. Result(s): For the first objective, 6589 adults with COVID-19 and AF were propensity score matched for age, gender, race, and comorbidities to 6589 adults with COVID-19 without AF. The survival probability was significantly lower in adults with COVID-19 and AF compared to matched adults without AF (82.7% compared to 88.3%, Log-Rank test P <.0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.61 (1.46, 1.78)) and risk of thromboembolic events was higher in patients with AF (9.9% vs 7.0%, Log-Rank test P <.0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.41 (1.26, 1.59)). For the second objective, 2454 adults with AF and COVID-19 were propensity score matched to 2454 adults with AF without COVID-19. The survival probability was significantly lower for adults with AF and COVID-19 compared to adults with AF without COVID-19, but there was no significant difference in risk of thromboembolic events. Conclusion(s): AF could be an important risk factor for short-term mortality with COVID-19, and COVID-19 may increase risk of short-term mortality amongst adults with AF.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 Mortality in an area of northeast brazil: Epidemiological characteristics and prospective spatiotemporal modeling. This study aimed to analyse the spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe, Northeast, Brazil. It was an ecological study utilising spatiotemporal analysis techniques that included all deaths confirmed by COVID-19 in Sergipe, from 2 April to 14 June 2020. Mortality rates were calculated per 100000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority among >= 60 years old (62%) and males (53%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). Observed was an increasing mortality trend across the state, with a higher increase in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside. Therefore, the use of spatial analysis techniques may contribute to surveillance and control of COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	PMH29 To Assess the Psychological IMPACT of COVID-19 Lockdown Among Healthy Individuals in India. Objectives: To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown among healthy individuals in India. Method(s): A self-assessed cross-sectional web-based study was conducted between 3rd April and 4th May 2020. Centre for Epidemiological Study for Depression questionnaire was administered for assessing the depressive symptoms among general public during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using the google forms the questionnaire was circulated among the public through social media. Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations of depressive symptoms among the study variables, and the logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the depressive symptoms. Result(s): A total of 588 participants with a mean (SD) age of 27.59 (8.72) years were responded to the questionnaire. The prevalence depressive symptoms were higher among males (54%) compared to females (36%). It was identified that the participants with educational background of pre-university education/diploma (58.22%) and middle school (71.42%), and occupation as semiskilled (60%) and unskilled workers (70%), social history of consumption alcohol (56.52%) and smoking (75%), and belong to joint family (53.10%) were the predictors for depressive symptoms. Subgroup analysis identified that these factors influence depressive symptoms especially among male population. Conclusion(s): It is an alarming situation that the depressive symptoms found in approximately 45% of healthy individuals during the COVID-19 lockdown. Educational interventions by the government and non-government organizations are very much required to combat the progression of depressive symptoms into disorder.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Experience in using oncology drugs inpatients with COVID-19. In relation to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2), oncologists need to facesome difficult situations. First of all, safety considerations about cancer patients during this pandemia. To keep safeboth patients and healthy workers is the most important rule. In our daily practice we adopted a specific policy about the conduct of our clinical managements of melanoma patients, in order to minimise the risk of any potentialexposure. We are prioritizing patients, according to the kind of treatment and the stage of disease. In order to avoidany gathering condition which could increase the risk of infection for patients, we are optimizing access aboutadjuvant treatment, considering of high priority the higher risk patients, privileging longer infusion schedule oftreatment for immunotherapy and/or selecting patients with BRAF mutation for starting target therapy. Metastaticpatients have the highest priority, and nothing changed in their daily management except for preferring, whenpossible, the longer schedule of treatment in order to reduce the access in the hospital. The enrolment in clinicaltrials is on hold and the patients still in treatment inside clinical study are managed in the respect of GCPs as well aspossible. Some additional issues are side effects in patients on treatment with target therapy and immunotherapy. Abouttarget therapy (especially dabrafenib and trametinib), patients who develop fever higher than 37.5 without resolvingafter discontinuation, should perform COVID test before to restart the treatment. Patients on treatment with immunotherapy who show pneumonitis at CT scan (even without fever), should perform COVID test before startsteroids. Immuno-oncologists have an important experience in the management of immuno-related adverse events. Thehyperactivation of immune system due to the immunotherapy strategies can develop some conditions which need ofimmuno-suppressive drugs to reduce the harmful immune reaction. Since the acute respiratory stress syndromeCOVID-19 related seems to occur from an excess of cytokine production, we focused our attention on the cytokinesstorm which probably lead to ARDS by COVID-19 and how to prevent or treat it. We know very well the CytokineRelease Syndrome (CRS), one of the most prominent and well described toxicity from chimeric antigen receptor Tcell therapy (CAR-T), as well as from some bispecific antibodies. In particular, we know the key role played by IL-6in the pathogenesis of these kind of hyperinflammation syndromes. Considering elevated serum concentration of IL-6 and CPR in patients admitted in ICUs department, we started to use monoclonal antibodies against IL6, above all to cilizumab. In Italy we started on 19th of March a phase II study( NCT04317092 ) which enrolled 330 patients in 24 hours, with the ability of to cilizumab to reduce the one-monthmortality rate as main endpoint. Results should be reported at the end of April. Other drugs active in reducing theCRS are at moment in clinical trial or expanded access program like JAK inhibitors, complement inhibitors, toll likereceptor inhibitors and others.	false

Objetivos: Relatar os aspectos clinicos de quatro pacientes com anemia falciforme com diagnostico da COVID-19 acompanhados no ambulatorio do HEMOES. Material e metodos: Foi realizado um levantamento dos dados de prontuario, resumo de alta hospitalar e entrevista clinica nos pacientes com doenca falciforme que desenvolveram COVID-19. Resultados: De um total de 338 pacientes acompanhados no ambulatorio, 1% apresentou diagnostico da COVID-19, 75% com o fenotipo SS e 25% com o fenotipo SC. Todos os pacientes eram da Grande Vitoria. O diagnostico foi realizado por RT-PCR de swab nasal em 75% e 25% por exame sorologico (IgG positivo). Nenhum paciente relatou contato com caso suspeito ou confirmado da COVID-19. A metade deles necessitou de internacao hospitalar, nenhum necessitou de internacao em UTI, apenas 25% necessitou de oxigenioterapia. Dois pacientes (50%) necessitou de transfusao sanguinea. Todos utilizavam a hidroxiureia para o tratamento da doenca de base. Os sintomas mais prevalentes foram febre (4/4), odinofagia (3/4) e dor muscular (3/4). Um paciente (25%) apresentou quadro neurologico atipico com disturbio de marcha e mantem acompanhamento com neurologista para elucidacao desta sequela. Nenhum paciente apresentou quadro de crise algica ou sindrome toracica aguda durante a infeccao pelo coronavirus. Discussao: A pandemia da COVID -19 trouxe varios desafios para os pacientes que ja apresentavam outras co-morbidades. Os pacientes com doenca falciforme, em geral, necessitam de atendimento em emergencias por outros motivos e a principio sao considerados de risco devido ao comprometimento do sistema imune. Nessa amostra todos os pacientes adquiriam a doenca por provavel infeccao comunitaria, nenhum caso apresentou vinculo temporal com atendimento em instituicoes de saude. A sindrome toracica aguda e uma das principais causas de mortalidade entre portadores da doenca falciforme podendo ser desencadeada por infeccoes respiratorias e, portanto, e uma preocupacao de complicacao desses pacientes. Na amostra analisada os pacientes apresentaram sintomas leves, apenas um caso apresentou-se de maneira atipica com sequela neurologica. Uma serie de quatro casos publicados pelo Reino Unido chamou a atencao para as complicacoes respiratorias desenvolvidas por pacientes com esse diagnostico, o que nao foi observado em nossa serie de casos. Conclusao: Em geral os pacientes apresentaram quadro leve da COVID-19, entretanto e necessario atencao para o agravamento da anemia com necessidade transfusional, independente da presenca de crise algica, sindrome toracica aguda ou outra apresentacao tipica da anemia falciforme.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Trends in the population knowledge, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 in the buea municipality two months after the onset of the pandemic in cameroon. Introduction: two months into the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon, we assess the trend in the knowledge, attitude and practices of the population with the progression of the disease and the implementation of preventive methods put in place by the government of Cameroon and health partners organizations in response to the pandemic. Method(s): this was a cross-sectional study conducted in selected health areas in the Buea municipality. A questionnaire was administered at the onset and two months later to collect data on the participants' knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 25. Result(s): a total of 480 and 680 participants were sampled at onset and two months later respectively. Of the 26 indicators of knowledge assessed, 22 (84.61%) showed significant increase (p<0.05) with the most significant changes observed with the symptoms, mode of transmission and prevention of the disease. The overall proportion of people with correct knowledge moved from 9.1% at onset to 41.4% two months after. Only 1.5% of participants had poor knowledge of the pandemic two months after against 14.2% at the onset. There was a significant (p<0.05) positive change in the population perception, attitude and practices toward COVID-19 two months after the onset of the pandemic. Conclusion(s): the population knowledge, attitude and practices on COVID-19 showed a positive trend two months after the onset of the pandemic. The implementation of government and health stakeholder preventive measures together with the incidence of the pandemic in Cameroon probably had a positive impact on the positive trend observed. There is a need for continuous sensitization to completely fill the knowledge gap of the population on COVID-19.Copyright © Forlemu Vanessa Mandaah et al.	false
0	470 COVID-19 Experience in New South Wales (NSW) - A Case Series. Background: Clinical data on novel coronavirus COVID-19 arising from early cases in Hubei province revealed high incidence of cardiac complications, especially arrhythmias, amongst infected. We present a case series describing the clinical course of three COVID-19 positive patients, which were amongst the first cases of the COVID-19 outbreak in NSW. Case 1: Male in early-80's from nursing home with comorbid ischaemic cardiomyopathy presents with a 3-day history of dyspnoea. Viral swabs confirmed COVID-19. Febrile on presentation with marked elevation in inflammatory markers. 72-hours into admission, patient developed recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). Despite maximal supportive and medical therapy, patient deteriorated clinically with increasing VT burden resulting in death. Case 2: Male in mid-50's presents with lethargy, myalgia and a subacute history of low-grade fever. Mild dyspnoea on presentation with subsequent development of profound hypoxia in the ensuing 24-48 hours. Blood tests showed rapid rise in inflammatory markers with renal impairment. Imaging showed widespread interstitial lung changes consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patient was intubated and bronchial lavage cultures confirmed COVID-19. Patient received anti-viral and corticosteroid therapy with subsequent improvement. Case 3: Female in late-80's from nursing home without significant background history. Reported mild coryzal symptoms but was screened for given close contact with COVID-19 positive patient. Swabs confirmed COVID-19 positivity. 48-hours into admission, patient developed fever which was managed conservatively. Blood tests showed mildly elevated inflammatory markers. She remained otherwise well and was discharged following negative viral testing. Conclusion(s): COVID-19, recently declared a pandemic, has a highly variable clinical presentation and outcomes.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Covid-19 and blood analysis: Vaio hospital Experience. INTRODUCTION: In March 2020 OMS declared the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Vaio hospital has been intended only for covid patients since 23th March until 18th may 2020. AIM OF THE STUDY: We observe the trend of leucocyte and lymphocyte counts, IL-6, PCR, PCT, LDH, D-dimer, AST and ALT at entrance in emergency room and at the end of hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have examined 43 covid patients, 10 women and 33 men. 25 of 43 patients has received intensive care (58%) and 7 of these 25 (28%) have died. IL-6 and PCT detections were performed by Acces2 immunoassay (Beckman Coulter), leucocyte and lymphocyte counts were performed on XM-1080 flow cytometer (Sysmex), PCR was determined with AU5800 (Beckman Coulter) immunoassay, AST, ALT and LDH with immunoenzymatic test were performed on AU5800, PT and D-dimer test on ACL TOP 550 (Werfen) with clot detection and immunoassay rispectively. For data statistical analysis we calculate mean, frequencies and t test (excel, Windows 10, Microsoft). RESULT(S): The mean measure at the early stage of hospitalization were: IL-6 105.33 pg/mL, leucocyte count 6,79 *103/muL, lymphocyte count 0.994*103/muL, PCR 92,73 mg/L, D-dimer 2745 mug/L, LDH 758 U/L, PCT 0,195 ng/mL, AST 58,71 U/L and ALT 61 U/L. The IL-6 alive patients mean value (112,46 pg/mL) was statistically different (t test p=0,04) from IL-6 dead patients mean value (274,33 pg/mL) and the alive patients mean age (60,6 years) wasn't statistically different (t test p=0,15) from dead patients mean age (66,9 years). At the end of hospitalization we observe an increase of lymphocyte and a decrease of PCR for alive patients and an increase of PCT only for dead patients. There is a significative difference (t test p<0,01) for the lymphocyte count between alive patients (mean values 2,11*103/muL) and dead patients (mean values 0.57*103/muL), and between PCR (t test p<0,01) alive patients (mean values 45 mg/L) and dead patients (mean value 243,42 mg/L) and also between PCT (t test p<0,01) alive patients (mean value 0,24 ng/mL) and dead patients (mean value 2,45 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: The increase of number of lymphocyte is a favorable prognostic indicator, as well as low values of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and PCR).	false
0	"The Role of Eosinophilic Cationic Protein as a New Biomarker in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with different severity of illness. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a clinical outcome ranging from mild to severe, including death. To date, it is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms. The routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission and also after discharge from the hospital after some time for follow up. Eosinophilic Cationic Protein (ECP) has various biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and neurotoxic functions, and it contributes to the regulation of fibroblast activity. ECP, also induces airway mucus secretion and interacts with the coagulation and complement systems. ECP has been developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. It is found in diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases. Method(s): We evaluated 59 positive patients who underwent a nasopharyngeal swab PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2, monitoring them through ECP and many routine laboratory tests such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D),C-reactive protein (CRP),IL-6, during the period from 20 March to 25 May 2020. ImmunoCAP FEIA Fluorometric Enzyme Immunocapture Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) measures the level of ECP in serum. Result(s): A total of 59 COVID 19-positive patients (64 + or-10 years, male 74%) were classified as having mild(HB) (n = 33), severe (S) (n = 19) and extremely severe (ES) (n = 7) illness. ECP levels were significantly higher in"" ES""[64,1 microg/L (18-117), p<0.001]; ""S"" showed [21.8 microg/L (5.5-46.3), p=0.016] and ""HB"" with level [16,5 microg/L (2,3-30,8), p=0.021]compared to Control Group [9.7 microg/L (6,1-13,4)].Interestingly, 14 patients monitored after discharge from hospital show altered ECP values (X=24,6 microg/L) correlated with poor oxygen saturation. Conclusion(s): We believe that the serial determination of ECP levels is useful for monitoring most patients with COVID 19 but above all to analyze the patients in the follow up to report a possible dysfunction of the respiratory tract."	false
0	Time course of the antibodies response in COVID-19. Background The role of the immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection is not yet well known, in particular about the persistence of circulating antibodies. The aim of the study is to assess the time course of the IgM and IgG response. Methods We conducted a study on 123 specimens of 62 subjects with disease confirmed by laboratory tests (time from the onset of symptoms from 3 to 110 days). Both IgM and IgG were measured with a chemiluminescence immunoassay (MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgM and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG respectively) on the Maglumi 800 Analyzer (Snibe, Shenzen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results The case study was subdivided into 8 groups (<=10 days from the onset of symptoms, 11-13 days, 14-17, 18-21, 22-28, 30-43, 46-71 and 72-110). The clinical sensitivity of IgG rose from 52.9% to 100% after 18 days, and then remained constant. The sensitivity of IgM rose from 35.3% up to about 78.6% at 20 days, then fell to about 27% after 80 days. Considering the concentrations in the samples, after a rapid increase up to about 20 days, we can see a subsequent decrease of the mean concentrations of both IgM and IgG levels. The quantitative comparison of the different classes showed significantly higher IgG concentrations in the days from 14 to 28 compared to both the first two groups and the groups after 46 days (Kruskall-Wallis test p=0.000001). As for the IgM, the trend is similar to that found for IgG, but the differences between groups were lower (Kruskall-Wallis test p=0.0022) and the absolute concentrations were about one order of magnitude smaller. Discussion The persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Studies on the immune response to other coronaviruses showed that the concentrations of IgG decline after few months from the onset of symptoms, although the positivity rate remained relatively stable over a longer period. In the present study, the results seems to confirm this trend. In fact, although the positivity rates did not fall below 100%, in the class with specimens from 72 to 110 days after the onset of symptoms the median IgG concentrations were less than 10% compared to the levels found after 15-20 days. Conclusion The antibodies titre in patients exposed to COVID-19 may decrease already after 6-7 weeks after the symptoms' onset.	false
0	Chronic kidney disease is a key risk factor for severe COVID-19: a call to action by the ERA-EDTA. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease have been listed as risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the first report of the disease in January 2020. However, this report did not mention chronic kidney disease (CKD) nor did it provide information on the relevance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria. As the disease spread across the globe, information on larger populations with greater granularity on risk factors emerged. The recently published OpenSAFELY project analysed factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients. The picture that arose differs significantly from initial reports. For example, hypertension is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.89], but renal disease very much is. Dialysis (aHR 3.69), organ transplantation (aHR 3.53) and CKD (aHR 2.52 for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) represent three of the four comorbidities associated with the highest mortality risk from COVID-19. The risk associated with CKD Stages 4 and 5 is higher than the risk associated with diabetes mellitus (aHR range 1.31-1.95, depending upon glycaemic control) or chronic heart disease (aHR 1.17). In another recent publication, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration identified that worldwide, CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, the distribution of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality appears to be different in patients with CKD when compared with the general population. The high prevalence of CKD in combination with the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in CKD necessitates urgent action for this group of patients. This article defines essential action points (summarized in Box 1), among which is advocating the inclusion of CKD patients in clinical trials testing the efficacy of drugs and vaccines to prevent severe COVID-19.

0	Prevalence of dementia and its impact on mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis. AIM: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dementia in patients with COVID-19 and its association with mortality. We also aimed to discover whether age, sex and other comorbidities might affect the association between dementia and mortality., METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC and the Cochrane Central Database. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated mortality/death/non-survivor in the studies. The pooled effect estimates were presented as odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio., RESULTS: A total of 56 577 patients from 10 studies were included. The prevalence of dementia in this pooled analysis was 10% (7-13%). Dementia was associated with increased mortality in both pooled unadjusted (odds ratio 2.80, 95% CI 1.85-4.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 93.7%) and adjusted effect estimates (adjusted odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 72.9%). The association between dementia and mortality was influenced by age (coefficient -0.047, P < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient -0.009, P = 0.020)., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that dementia was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. The association was affected by age and comorbidities. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; **: **-**. Copyright © 2020 Japan Geriatrics Society.	false

Acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world, since its discovery in 2019, Wuhan, China. This disease is called COVID-19 and already killed over 1 million people worldwide. The clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unfortunately, so far, there is no validated vaccine, and its management consists mainly of supportive care. Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are highly prevalent in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. In fact, a prothrombotic state seems to be present in most fatal cases of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, causing immune-mediated tissue damage, disruption of the endothelial barrier, and uncontrolled thrombogenesis. Thrombin is the key regulator of coagulation and fibrin formation. In severe COVID-19, a dysfunctional of physiological anticoagulant mechanisms leads to a progressive increase of thrombin activity, which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome development and a poor prognosis. Protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR1) is the main thrombin receptor and may represent an essential link between coagulation and inflammation in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the potential role of PAR1 inhibition and regulation in COVID-19 treatment.	false
0	Socioeconomic inequalities in the spread of coronavirus-19 in the United States: A examination of the emergence of social inequalities. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the contribution variation in socioeconomic status in predicting the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths., METHODS: Analyses used incidence data on daily COVID + case counts from all counties from the initial wave of infections, merged with data from the U.S. census data to measure county-level SES and confounders. Multivariable analyses relied on survival analyses and Poisson regression to examine timing of county-level index cases and of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in infected counties to examine the spread and severity of COVID-19 while adjusting for adjusted for Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, gender, and urbanicity. Effect moderation by social distancing parameters was examined., RESULTS: Results indicate that higher SES was associated with earlier incidence of index cases, but that as social distancing took place inequalities in SES inverted so that growth in incidence was slower in higher SES counties, where case-fatality rates were lower., CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to date to show what happens when an opportunistic disease that could affect anyone meets the American system of inequality and is powerfully shaped by it.

0	SARS-2-Cov 2 induced coagulopathy: An antiphospholipid cohort study. Introduction Various coagulation alterations have been reported in COVID-19 patients, especially in those with the most severe forms: A) elevated d-dimer (x6 time normal value) correlates with poor prognosis; b) low-molecular weight heparins have been reported as an effective drug to support intensive care; c) thrombosis of the pulmonary vessels has often been found at the autoptic investigation of COVID-19 patients. It is well-known that bacterial and viral infections can induce antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which is often not associated to thrombotic events. A recent study reported the presence of aPL mainly of IgA isotype (not part of laboratory work-out for APS), in COVID-19 positive patients, they did not specify the aPL titres and LAC testing was not available. Most importantly from a clinical point of view, all the reported patients have suffered in the past for vascular manifestations. In order to better understand the SARS-2-Cov 2 coagulopathy, we performed an observational study aiming to investigate the status of haemostasis in these patients, performing a panel of coagulation markers. Patients and methods 101 consecutive PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infected patients admitted at the AO Ordine Mauriziano Hospital, Torino, Italy, were included in this study. Patients were tested for aPL profile, D-Dimer, von Willebrand factor, and IL-6 levels. Patients defined as critically ill were those hospitalized in an intensive care unit at the time of the blood withdrawal. Results Our data showed positivity for any aPL in about half of the patients (48.5%). In detail, we found that a positivity for Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC) can be detected in up to 1 out of 3 symptomatic COVID-19 patients when tested according to the ISTH. However, the so called triple aPL positivity, the profile most strongly associated with a thrombotic event in patients with APS (the concomitant presence of LAC, anticardiolipin IgG and anti-beta2GPI IgG antibodies) has been observed in only one patient (1%). When including any triple positivity (for LAC plus anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-GPI either IgG/IgM) we were able to identify 3 patients (3%). More importantly, most of aPL positivity was detected at the low-medium titre; aPL positivity are known to be detectable during infections, to include viral diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C. The presence of aPL in these contexts is often transient and almost always non-specific (nonthrombosis-related). Discussion In conclusion, although isolated, LAC positivity is present in about a third of patients. Their clinical role in the pathogenesis of a coagulopathy and pulmonary thrombosis during COVID-19 infection still need to be demonstrated.	false
0	Management of an acquired hemophilia a case with covid19. Background. Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by auto-antibodies directed against clotting factor VIII (FVIII), often resulting in severe bleeding manifestations. Its treatment is based on haemostatic control and immunosuppressive treatment (IST) to eradicate circulating inhibitors. Since COVID19 pandemic breakout, the management of autoimmune disorders represented a challenge for clinician. Case Report. A 63-years old woman was admitted at the emergency department (ED) at the end of May 2020 for development of hematomas at the upper right arm and left leg. The same patient accessed to ED 3 months before for severe anemia (Hemoglobin, Hb, 4.3 g/dl) and renal failure (Creatinine, Crs, 3.45 mg/dl). A nephrologic consultancy lean for a multifactorial renal failure (acute anemia and anti-inf lammatory drugs abuse). In the recent ED access, anemia and impaired renal function were again detected (Hb 4.9 g/dl, Crs 4,4 mg/dl) with prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time (aPTT ratio, 2.91). An aPTT-mix test was performed and resulted indicative of inhibitor presence. Factor VIII (FVIII) was quantified (FVIII 0.5 UI/dl) and FVII-Inhibitor titred (29 UB). A diagnosis of AHA was made. As indicated by Hospital guidelines, a RT-PCR nasal swab (NS) for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was performed and resulted positive. Thus, the patient was admitted in a dedicated Unit. Here, a screening for other infections, autoimmune disorders and occult neoplasms was carried out, resulting negative. From the immunosuppressive point of view, the case was discussed with an infective disease consultant and pneumologists. Given the absence of any symptoms or sign related to the viral infection and the necessity to initiate a specific IST, an initial management with prednisolone (1 mg/Kg) was started. Given the lack of appreciable response, a second line IST was needed. In order to avoid a viral infection awakening, silent so far, it was waited until two consecutive negative RT-PCR NS for COVID19 were obtained. After that, as a precautionary measure we waited for other two weeks and finally performed a third RT-PCR NS. As it resulted negative, a second line IST with Rituximab (RTX) 375 mg/m2 weekly was started. In the meanwhile, an optimized hemostatic control was assured, first with recombinant activated FVII and then with recombinant porcine FVIII. The patient remains asymptomatic from the infective point of view. A hematologic response started to emerge after the third RTX infusion. Conclusions. This AHA case management resulted challenging since its association with silent COVID19 infection. It was probably not associated from an etiological point of view with COVID19 infection as it did not resolve with the negativization of the COVID19 NS. Our strategy, consisting in a gradual implementation of the IST while moving forward from the NS negativization, together with the optimization of the hemostatic control, resulted safe, as the patient did not experienced an awakening of the silent COVID-19 infection, and efficacy at the same time.	false
0	"The global impact of COVID-19 on global and regional hepatitis C elimination efforts. Background: COVID-19 has placed significant strain on national healthcare systems at a critical moment in the context of hepatitis elimination Mathematical models can be used to evaluate the possible impact of programmatic delays on hepatitis disease burden The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the incremental change in hepatitis C liverrelated deaths and liver cancer, following a 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year hiatus in hepatitis elimination program progress Methods: Previously developed models were adapted for 110 countries to include a status quo or ""no delay"" scenario and a ""1-year delay"" scenario assuming significant disruption in interventions (screening, diagnosis and treatment) in the year 2020 Annual, country-level, model outcomes were extracted, and weighted averages were used to calculate regional (WHO and World Bank Income Group) and global estimates from 2020 to 2030 The incremental annual change in outcomes was calculated by subtracting the ""no-delay"" estimates from the ""1-year delay"" estimates Results: The ""1-year delay"" scenario resulted in 44,800 (95% UI: 43,800 - 49,300) excess hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and 72,300 (95% UI: 70,600 - 79,400) excess liver-related deaths (LRDs), relative to the ""no delay"" scenario globally, from 2020-2030 Most missed treatments would be in lower-middle income countries, while most excess HCC and LRDs would be among high-income countries Under the ""1-year delay"" scenario, no regions were projected to reach the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment or incidence, and only the highincome country group was projected to achieve the target for liver-related deaths Conclusion(s): The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond the direct morbidity and mortality associated with exposure and infection In order to mitigate the impact on viral hepatitis programming and reduce excess mortality from delayed treatment, policy makers should prioritize hepatitis programs as soon as it becomes safe to do so.

0	Clinical pathology resident education during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 arrived at our medical centre in March 2020 with substantial force. Clinical pathology concepts began to have a new, direct relevance to our residents' lives. As we wondered 'Have I been exposed? Do I need to self-isolate? Are the tests reliable? Am I protecting myself adequately while handling specimens?', these questions drew new interest in laboratory methods, test interpretation and limitations, supply chain issues, safety and quality. By incorporating SARS-CoV-2 teaching points into laboratory medicine lectures, we enlivened concepts of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and methodologic issues in serologic, molecular and antigen testing for pathology residents. We drew from the emerging literature on SARS-CoV-2 to create lectures and added details from our own institutional experience with COVID-19. When the pandemic fades from memory, clinical pathology education can still benefit from mnemonics, analogies, anecdotes and creative efforts that capture the attention of the audience.

0	Suppression of Covid-19 outbreak among healthcare workers at the Treviso Regional Hospital, Italy and lessons for ophthalmologists. PURPOSE: To describe a strategy to reduce Covid-19 spread among healthcare workers and provide ophthalmologists with recommendations useful for a possible second wave of Covid-19 in Autumn., METHODS: Epidemiological surveillance at the Ca Foncello Hospital (Veneto, Italy) since 24 February 2020 to 24 April 2020 when the municipality of Treviso was hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The number of naso-pharigeal (NP) swabs performed was 7010., RESULTS: The number of infected among healthcare workers was 209/ 3924 (5.32%): medical doctors: 28 cases / 498 (5.6%). None among ophthalmologists; specialized nurses: 86/1294 (6.4%) None in the ophthalmic unit; intermediate care technicians: 68/463 (14.7%). The 46% of the positive tested were asymptomatic. We share key suggested actions for the reorganization in ophthalmological services: be part of a global epidemiological local strategy of containment (Testing, Tracing, Treating); protect your department: Keep on screening patients by telephone interview before entering the hospital; promote continuous and appropriate use of PPE both for doctors and for patients; make any effort to obtain a continuous flow of patients in every line of the ophthalmic service; treat appropriately any single patient with vision threatening condition; avoid unnecessary or futile testings and examinations., CONCLUSION: The Treviso model shows that it is possible and safe to keep on performing high risk hospital activities like ophthalmology, even in the epicenter of covid outbreak, if adequate actions are performed. We discuss about the value of NP swabs and serological tests as a strategy in case of a second wave of infections.	false
0	Analysis of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Reveals Prevalence of D614G Mutation in Spike Protein Predicting an Increase in Interaction With TMPRSS2 and Virus Infectivity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has emerged as a global pandemic worldwide. In this study, we used ARTIC primers-based amplicon sequencing to profile 225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India. Phylogenetic analysis of 202 high-quality assemblies identified the presence of all the five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed Europe and Southeast Asia as two major routes for introduction of the disease in India followed by local transmission. Interestingly, the19B clade was found to be more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) compared to other genomes reported so far from India. Haplotype network analysis showed evolution of 19A and 19B clades in parallel from predominantly Gujarat state in India, suggesting it to be one of the major routes of disease transmission in India during the months of March and April, whereas 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. At the same time, 20A and 20B clades depicted prevalence of four common mutations 241 C > T in 5' UTR, P4715L, F942F along with D614G in the Spike protein. D614G mutation has been reported to increase virus shedding and infectivity. Our molecular modeling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation resulted in enhanced affinity of Spike S1-S2 hinge region with TMPRSS2 protease, possibly the reason for increased shedding of S1 domain in G614 as compared to D614. Moreover, we also observed an increased concordance of G614 mutation with the viral load, as evident from decreased Ct value of Spike and the ORF1ab gene.

0	[Laboratory testing, prevention and control of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019]. With many hard efforts, the epidemic prevention and control work in China has borne successful, accelerating the gradual restoration of production, living order and routine medical work. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but they are potential transmitter of the virus. There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic. Therefore, it is urgent to develop better screening and laboratory testing for asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 with high speed, sensitivity and specificity. It is also important to improve our risk assessment, prevention and control strategies to further prevent the spread of the epidemic.	false

0	Treatment of hairy cell leukemia. Introduction: Purine analogs made dramatic improvements for patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), but patients often relapse, require multiple treatments, and may become refractory. Major developments in treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL occurred with discovery of disease biology. New agents increase the complexity of clinical decision-making. Areas covered: Anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin Moxetumomab Pasudotox (Moxe), CD20 Mabs rituximab and obinutuzumab, BRAF/MEK inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib-trametinib, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib have been tested in HCL. All show efficacy but with different treatment durations and response rates, including for eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD). Side effects differ and must be considered when selecting treatment. Studies from PubMed indexed papers and abstracts presented at major international conferences are included. Expert opinion: Rituximab with either purine analog or BRAF-inhibitor achieves high rates of MRD-free complete remission (CR). Moxe achieves MRD-free CR without chemotherapy toxicities. Moxe should be considered prior to splenectomy or development of adenopathy. BRAF/MEK inhibition and ibrutinib are effective options but most patients remain MRD+, requiring indefinite treatment or rituximab to prevent relapse. Under investigation is MRD elimination with CD20 antibody combined with Moxe or BRAF inhibitor. High-risk diseases including HCL variant and IGHV4-34+ unmutated HCL require further investigation.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	false
0	Implications of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown on children's behaviour in Punjab, India. BACKGROUND: Lockdown is one of the prevalent tools that are used to control the spread of COVID-19 virus in India. Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship; because of which, they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire-based study. METHOD(S): A web-based questionnaire was prepared, and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India, namely, Ludhiana, Sahibzada Ajit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews was statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULT(S): Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively; 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends; therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown, children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. CONCLUSION(S): This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India, was compromised during the lockdown period induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study may also trigger the international authorities to frame the guidelines of lockdown in the interest of mental health of their native children.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	false

Background: Liver injury related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is common, but its effects on outcomes for patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis are unclear In a multicenter cohort of COVID-19 infected patients with CLD, we analyzed the incidence and predictors of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and its impact on in-hospital mortality Methods: We identified all adults with CLD from among 10,859 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who had been admitted to any of 12 hospitals in a New York health care system between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. We defined ACLF using the EASLCLIF Consortium definition. Patient follow-up was through April 30, 2020, or until the date of discharge, transfer, or death Results: We identified 192 CLD patients, representing 1.8% of adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection A majority of patients with CLD experienced at least one organ failure, with respiratory failure (39%) and renal failure (26%) being the most common Of the 84 patients with cirrhosis, 32 (38%) developed ACLF Non-Hispanic ethnicity and presence of hypertension at baseline were independent predictors of the development of ACLF among patients with cirrhosis In-hospital mortality was not different between CLD patients with or without cirrhosis (p=0 24) but was higher in those with cirrhosis and who developed ACLF (adjusted HR 9 06, 95% CI: 2 63-31 12, p <0 001) There was a trend for incrementally worse survival by increased grade of ACLF ( p for trend equal to 0 002), with adjusted HRs of 3 09 (95% CI: 0 54 to 17 34, p equal to 0 20) for ACLF grade I, 9 99 (95% CI: 1 49 to 66 95, p equal to 0 02) for ACLF grade II, and 18 31 (95% CI: 4 50 to 74 46, p less than 0 001) for ACLF grade III compared to patients with cirrhosis who did not develop ACLF Conclusion(s): Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and cirrhosis are at risk of developing ACLF, leading to poor survival.	false

Background: COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge with globally 12,567,457 coronavirus cases reported and 561,879 deaths as of July 11, 2020 Isolated small studies have reported the prevalence of comorbid chronic liver disease (CM-CLD) and COVID-19 associated acute liver injury (COVID-19-ALI) in hospitalized patients In this metaanalysis, we assessed the association of comorbid liver disease and acute liver injury and outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalized patients Methods: Observational studies describing the CM-CLD and COVID-19-ALI and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, were identified. Data was extracted following MOOSE guidelines with a consensus of four independent reviewers. Adverse outcomes were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), severe disease and in-hospital mortality Data was analysed using Review Manager 5 4 The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using randomeffects models The p value <0 05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 12 studies with 7564 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included Out of these, 12 studies (7564 patients) and 3 studies (146 patients) provided data on CM-CLD and COVID-19-ALI, respectively The pooled prevalence of CM-CLD was 2 67% [(202/7564)*d COVID-19-ALI was 22 6% [(33/146)* patients with poor outcomes, the prevalence of CM-CLD was 2 4%(54/2233) and COVID-19-ALI was 32% (18/56) In meta-analysis, CM-CLD had no significant association with poor outcomes (OR:0 89; 95%CI:0 65-1 22;p=0 47) with no heterogeneity in the data (p=0 93;I2=0%) COVID-19-ALI had higher odds of poor outcomes with OR of 2 49 (95%CI:1 09-5 69;p=0 03) and without any significant heterogeneity between studies (p=0 67;I2=0%) Conclusion(s): Our meta-analysis suggests that acute liver injury was significantly associated with COVID-19 severity and poor outcomes Future studies should evaluate changing levels of biomarkers amongst liver disease patients to predict poor outcomes of COVID-19.	false
0	Acute liver injury in COVID-19: Risk factors in a large pediatric cohort. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with acute liver injury in adults, but liver injury has not been well characterized in pediatric patients We aim to describe the prevalence of liver injury in children in the setting of acute severe respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) infection and to identify risk factors for the development of COVID-19-associated liver disease Methods: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of all patients <= 21 years of age with an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction presenting between March 14th to June 30th, 2020 to two tertiary children's hospitals in New York City Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at both institutions Patients without aminotransferase testing or those with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were excluded from analysis Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (>30 U/L) and severe if ALT was more than five times ULN Results: A total of 225 patients were evaluated The mean age was 11 years (standard deviation +/- 7 years); 61% were male, 55% were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, and 21% were black. Obesity was identified in 35% of children; 7% had pre-existing liver disease The majority (74%) of patients were hospitalized, while 23% of patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 8% developed multi-organ failure (MOF) Two percent of patients (5/225) died 45% of patients developed acute liver injury (median 67 U/L, [IQR 45-160] U/L), and severe liver injury (median 271 [IQR 193- 389] U/L) was noted in 12% of all children The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms was reported in 54% of patients Factors associated with acute liver injury in univariate analysis included age (p = 0 015), obesity (p = 0 0001), pre-existing liver disease (p = 0.005), elevated inflammatory markers such as ferritin (p < 0 0001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0 0001), d-dimer (p = 0 002), as well as MOF (p = 0 0009) and ICU admission (p = 0 026) In multivariate regression model, acute liver injury was significantly associated with older age (OR 1 18; p = 0 01), CRP (OR 1 07; p = 0 01) and ICU admission (OR 8 9, p = 0 02) Clinical and laboratory characteristics are listed in the Table 1 Conclusion(s): Acute liver injury is common in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection but is most often mild Patients who are older and those with higher disease severity may be at risk for more significant liver injury.(Table Presented).	false
0	Abnormal liver enzymes at baseline predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients without chronic liver disease: A large, mutli-center us cohort study. Background: Abnormalities in liver chemistries in COVID-19 infection are common, but their effects on outcomes are unclear Our study assessed the prevalence and prognostic value of initial liver chemistries in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients without known chronic liver disease Methods: We reviewed electronic medical records of 10,614 COVID-19 patients without known chronic liver disease who were admitted to our health system from March 1 to April 30, 2020 We analyzed baseline demographics and liver chemistries The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation Results: Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) appeared in 59% of patients, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 54% of patients, alkaline phosphatase in 13% of patients, and bilirubin in 5% of patients The majority of patients had AST and ALT within >1 to <=4x the ULN (49% and 54%, respectively). The majority of patients had AST and ALT within >1 to <=4x the ULN (49% and 54%, respectively) Extreme elevations of AST and ALT were uncommon, with 4.6% of patients having AST >4 to <=10x ULN, 0.8% having AST >10x ULN, 4.1% of patients having ALT >4 to <=10x ULN, and 0.8% having ALT >10x ULN. Most patients (76%) had AST higher than ALT on presentation Based on our a priori definitions of severe liver injury, there were 936 patients (8 9%) with a hepatocellular pattern, 133 patients (1 3%) with a cholestatic pattern, and 91 patients (0 9%) with a mixed pattern The prevalence of liver chemistry elevations differed based on sex, ethnicity, race, and presence of comorbidities (Table 2) Compared to females, males were more likely to have elevations in AST (64 8% vs 50 1%, p <0 001) and bilirubin (5 9% vs 2 8%, p <0 001) but less likely to have elevations in alkaline phosphatase (12 0% vs 14 2%, p =0 001) Elevations in ALT did not differ by sex (p = 0 34) In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, patients with elevations in AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin had increased mortality (Figure 1A-D) and increased mortality or need for mechanical ventilation when compared to patients with measurements within the normal range These higher risks remained significant for elevations in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase after adjustment for demographic factors Increasing severity of AST was associated with incrementally poor survival Patients with a cholestatic liver injury and those with AST predominant elevation (AST/ALT >1) had higher risks of in-patient mortality and the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation Conclusion(s): Liver test abnormalities are common upon initial presentation in COVID-19 infection and are associated with increased mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients without underlying chronic liver disease Those with a cholestatic pattern of liver injury are at the highest risk for poor outcomes (Figure Presented)(Table Presented).	false
0	The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Prognosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Adult Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. Backgroundandobjectives SinceDecember 2019, coronavirusdisease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak occurred and has rapidly spread worldwide. However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed. Results A total of 7%(99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40%(40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72). Conclusions AKI is uncommon but carries high in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Partnering for Enhanced Digital Surveillance of Influenza-like Disease and the Effect of Antivirals and Vaccines (PEDSIDEA) -First Results in the United States. Purpose: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are common reasons for medical visits in children. Current surveillance systems are focused on reported cases of ARI or influenza-like illness (ILI) at the population level, but universal measures for individual-level disease severity have been lacking. Meanwhile, regulatory authorities are asking for the development of standardized clinical outcome measures for the evaluation of novel antivirals and vaccines. Method(s): We developed a composite clinical score based on extensive systematic literature review and WHO-criteria for uncomplicated and complicated influenza infection. Recognizing that data standardization is most challenging in infants and young children, the ViVI Disease Severity Score was first tested across the entire pediatric age spectrum and then extended to use in adults. The mobile application facilitates data entry in compliance with CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) terminologies and regulatory data standard requirements. Result(s): The Score was made available for validation in the context of a hospital-based quality improvement (QI) program encompassing 6073 children with ARI (mean age 3.13; S.D. 3.89; range: 0 to 18.79). QI staff scored patients within 3-6 minutes and obtained nasopharyngeal swab samples. The national reference center performed molecular diagnostics for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adeno-, rhino-, boca-, metapneumo-, parainfluenza-, and coronaviruses. Blinded bioinformatics analysis revealed that ViVI Scores were strongly predictive of antibiotic and antiviral use, even though the prescribing physicians were unaware of the scoring and results. Average disease severity was highest with RSV, followed by metapneumovirus and influenza A (H3N2) infections. The model was validated in a European multi-center setting and is currently in use in community clinics in the New Orleans metropolitan area. Healthcare workers score patients (both children and adults) using the mobile app while rapid diagnostics for influenza and RSV (Sofia, Quidel Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) are underway. Rapid test results are transmitted wirelessly to the Louisiana Department of Health with severity scores being reported via mobile app. Conclusion(s): We report a first successful pilot program linking rapid diagnostics with instantaneous individual-level reporting of severity in patients with ARI using a digital, prospectively validated scoring system for children and adults. Real-time mapping of incidence and severity will provide timely information to hospital staff and public health stakeholders. Data standardization allows cross-cohort comparisons in single and multi-center settings, in full compliance with HIPPAA (U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and regulatory data standards. Additional proof-of-concept studies are underway in Cambodia and other low-middle income countries.	false
0	Pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium in a teenager with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the rapidly increasing number of infectious cases. The current literature is deficient regarding pediatric population data. We report a case of a seventeenyear- old female, known history of marijuana use, presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and was found to have pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: The patient presented to the emergency room with a three days history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and one day history of diarrhea. She lived with her grandmother who was presumed to be COVID-19 positive based on symptoms. Her admission labs revealed pyuria suspicious for urinary tract infection. The remainder of her serology was unremarkable. Patient's nasal swab was PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Due to abdominal pain, a CTScan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained which was concerning for pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. CT-scan thorax confirmed the findings and revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck soft tissue. Contrast Barium Esophagogram was done which was unremarkable, without any extraluminal contrast leakage. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for observation and supportive care. DISCUSSION: The patient recovered to her baseline with the supportive treatment and did not require any respiratory support during the hospital stay.	false
0	Gastric ischemia: A late complication of heller myotomy and dor fundoplication. INTRODUCTION: Gastric ischemia is a rare disorder due to the generous vascular supply of the stomach. It most commonly is a consequence of severe sepsis, shock, or splanchnic vessel hypoperfusion. In extremely rare cases, gas bloat syndrome may cause severe gastric dilation to the extent of causing gastric ischemia. Gas bloat syndrome is a known complication of gastric fundoplication in which gastric dilation occurs from the impaired expulsion of trapped air from belching due to the compressive gastric wrap at the distal esophagus. Partial fundoplication has led to decrease in the incidence of gas bloat syndrome as compared to the complete technique. We present a patient with a history of achalasia treated with Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication that developed a large gastric ischemic ulcer as a late complication. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: An 82-year-old female with history of peptic ulcer disease, gastroparesis, and type II achalasia presented to the hospital with coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia, epigastric pain, and early satiety. Two years prior she underwent Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication and has since complained of these progressively worsening symptoms. On presentation, the patient's hemoglobin was 9.3 gm/dL and a pantoprazole drip was initiated. CT abdomen revealed severe gastric wall thickening with no gastric volvulus. The patient underwent an EGD the following day which revealed inflamed, necrotic, and ulcerated mucosa involving the fundus, gastric body, and antrum. Biopsy confirmed ischemic features. Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen ruled out an occlusive vascular disease. Patients symptoms continued to improve over the next 48 hours and was discharged on pantoprazole, and a short course of a prokinetic and simethicone. At discharge, a repeat EGD with Endoflip technique was scheduled at 8 weeks to evaluate the lower esophageal sphincter distensibility. Unfortunately, this procedure was delayed due to the COVID pandemic and results are not available at the time of this abstract. DISCUSSION: Failure to recognize gas bloat syndrome as a complication after fundoplication can lead to severe gastric distention and ischemia, especially if confounded with emptying disorders such as gastroparesis. Endoflip is a promising tool to evaluate the distensibility of the lower esophageal sphincter. Further research is needed to validate the use of this technique to evaluate the response to fundoplication and rule out severe tightening of the gastroesophageal junction. (Figure Presented).	false
0	Rapid deterioration of a covid-19 patient with gastrointestinal presentation. INTRODUCTION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 19 (SARS-CoV19) is a known viral pneumonia. However, gastrointestinal involvement is not uncommon, and can be the only presenting feature. Our case presented with only diarrhea; then the patient developed respiratory symptoms. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 80 y/o man with history of hypertension and chronic renal failure. He presented with lethargy, generalized weakness, diarrhea, nausea, and oliguria for several days. The patient denied coughing, shortness of breath, fever, or abdominal pain. Social history showed his daughter had a mild febrile illness. Where both reported testing COVID19 positive after the patient was admitted. On physical examination, vitals were stable, except blood pressure 91/54 mm Hg. The patient was alert, and oriented. Mucus membranes were dry. Cardiovascular, lung and abdominal examination were unremarkable. The initial laboratory results showed leukopenia with normal WBC count, serum creatinine 8.84 mg/dL, RT PCR-nasal was positive on admission. CXR was clear on admission. The 4th day, the patient's reported anxiety, non-productive cough. Crackles and cyanosis on examination. Failure to maintain oxygenation lead to mechanical ventilation. CXR showed bilateral infiltration. The patient finished 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ascorbic acid, zinc, and one dose of Intravenous interleukin 6 inhibitor. He also required hemodialysis, and vasopressors. The family decided on providing comfort care with no invasive interventions. DISCUSSION: Fever is the most common symptom (85%), then cough (68%). vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (3.7%). COVID19 cases who present with gastrointestinal symptoms have a worse prognosis compared to those with respiratory presentations. Our patient had severe diarrhea that lead to hypovolemic shock with multiple organ failure. As seen in previous reported cases, respiratory symptoms started within a week of the first gastrointestinal complaint, which correlates with the surge in the inflammatory markers. Screening for COVID19 infection through fecal PCR has shown to have similar accuracy as the PCR from respiratory samples. RT PCR-stool is potentially one of the methods for early detection of SARS-CoV2 disease when it has non-respiratory symptoms or in asymptomatic cases.	false
0	CT-152: Application of Web-Scraping Techniques for Autonomous Massive Retrieval of Hematologic Patients' Information During SARS-CoV2 Pandemic. Context: Data collection involving a large number of patients is usually known as a tedious and time-consuming task by healthcare professionals. Current patient load makes collecting clinical data almost impossible even though we need that information more than ever. Objective(s): We wanted to deploy a system that automatically and autonomously retrieves clinical data from our patients suffering from SARS-CoV2 that arrive at hospital admission to collect that information for further analysis. Design(s): We designed a daemon in PHP programming language connected to a MySQL MariaDB database that continuously searches for new patients consulting at hospital. We collected medical history, disease records, regular medication, physical exploration, vital signs, blood chemistry and count, and finally, microbiology testing of SARS-CoV2 (both PCR and ELISA antibody testing). As we don't have access to any API service (out-of-the-box connection to the data mainframe), we took advantage of web-scraping (brute-force data extraction from webpages using HTTP protocol) applied to our hospital web interface. Setting(s): Monitoring was made between 1st March, 2020 and 15th April, 2020 (during worst Coronavirus outbreak phase of the country), using only one computer connected to the hospital network. The number of patients identified was 259, each one with 344 clinical and testing variables. Result(s): Using this technique, we collected data of 259 hematologic patients without human intervention and more than 300 variables have been analyzed. Nowadays, manual revision of certain aspects of the database (e.g., comorbidities) is needed and some data needs to be manually entered due to the lack of proper codification. In the future, with the development of semantic-matching technologies, fully autonomous building of the databases will be possible. In the meantime, our technique can solve the capture of enormous amount of clinical information without effort. With that information, observational studies, even a prognosis score using machine learning, have been developed in our center. Conclusion(s): Data collection for further analysis is usually a vital, but time-consuming, task in order to answer clinical questions. We developed a technique that helped our center retrieve patients' clinical information autonomously during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Risk factors, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and imaging of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in North of Iran. Background: Due to the physiological changes in the body during pregnancy, the increased susceptibility to viral infections during this period and also the high prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Guilan province, Iran, this study aimed to evaluate risk factors, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and imaging of pregnant mothers with COVID-19. Method(s): In this descriptive study, 70 pregnant women aged 17-41 years with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from early March to late April 2020 were enrolled. Sampling was performed by census and from all hospitals in Guilan. The research instruments included a researcher-made questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, medical examinations, and paraclinical results. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16. Frequency and percent were used to describe qualitative variables; for quantitative variables, if they were normally distributed, mean and standard deviation were used, and if they were non-normal, median and interquartile range (IQR) were used. Result(s): The most severe symptoms recorded in mothers at the time of hospitalization were fever (47%), shortness of breath (16%) and cough (15%), respectively. One of 68 (1%) was in the severe stage of the disease and two mothers (2%) were in critical condition and admitted to the intensive care unit and finally died. Fifty-five of 66 women (83%) had lymphopenia, 22 of 42 (52%) tested positive on PCR, and 30 of 33 (90%) had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Results showed that 15 of 32 patients who gave birth had preterm delivery (46%). Conclusion(s): The most common manifestations of the disease in pregnant women were fever, cough and shortness of breath, and in some cases muscle pain. The most common laboratory finding in infected mothers was lymphopenia. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth in women included an increase in cesarean delivery.Copyright © 2020 Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R. Iran. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 in 17 italian pediatric emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Variability in presentation of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a challenge in emergency departments (EDs) in terms of early recognition, which has an effect on disease control and prevention. We describe a cohort of 170 children with COVID-19 and differences with the published cohorts. METHOD(S): Retrospective chart reviews on children (0-18 years) evaluated in 17 Italian pediatric EDs. RESULT(S): In our cohort (median age of 45 months; interquartile range of 4 months-10.7 years), we found a high number of patients ,1 year with COVID-19 disease. The exposure happened mainly (59%) outside family clusters; 22% had comorbidities. Children were more frequently asymptomatic (17%) or with mild diseases (63%). Common symptoms were cough (43%) and difficulty feeding (35%). Chest computed tomography, chest radiograph, and point-of-care lung ultrasound were used in 2%, 36%, and 8% of cases, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients were admitted because of their clinical conditions. The minimal use of computed tomography and chest radiograph may have led to a reduced identification of moderate cases, which may have been clinically classified as mild cases. CONCLUSION(S): Italian children evaluated in the ED infrequently have notable disease symptoms. For pediatrics, COVID-19 may have rare but serious and life-threatening presentations but, in the majority of cases, represents an organizational burden for the ED. These data should not lower the attention to and preparedness for COVID-19 disease because children may represent a source of viral transmission. A clinically driven classification, instead of a radiologic, could be more valuable in predicting patient needs and better allocating resources.

0	Utility of Screening Chest Radiographs in Patients with Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic COVID-19 in Singapore. Background Singapore saw an escalation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases from under 4,000 in April 2020 to over 40,000 in June 2020 largely attributed to spread within shared facilities housing foreign workers. Appropriate triage and escalation of clinical care are critical for this patient group managed in community care facilities (CCFs). Purpose To evaluate the imaging guideline recommendations for COVID-19 from the Fleischner Society and analyze the clinical utility of chest radiograph screening for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who were admitted to Singapore Expo, a designated CCF, for continuation of their management during May 3-31, 2020 were identified. Upon admission, patients aged 36 and older without any baseline chest imaging received a chest radiograph. All chest radiographs and clinical outcomes of patients including those who were subsequently transferred to acute hospitals for escalation of care were reviewed. Key proportions of patients with findings of pulmonary infection and those requiring further inpatient treatment were calculated, and 95% binomial proportion confidence intervals obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. Results The study included 5,621 patients: all men 100% (5,621/5,621), mean age 37 +/- 8 years (range 17-60). A total of 1,964 chest radiographs were performed of which normal accounted for 98.0% (1,925/1,964) and findings of pulmonary infection represented 2.0% (39/1,964). Only 0.2% (4/1,964) with chest radiograph findings of pulmonary infection (all of whom were symptomatic) required supplemental oxygenation and inpatient treatment. None of the asymptomatic patients with findings of pulmonary infection required supplemental oxygenation, and they received only symptomatic treatment. Conclusion In accordance with Fleischner Society recommendations, chest radiograph screening for patients with COVID-19 aged 17-60 with mild or no symptoms is not indicated unless there is risk of clinical deterioration.

0	PIN167 Patient-Reported Outcomes to Capture the Signs, Symptoms and Impacts of COVID-19 and the IMPACT of the Pandemic on People with and without Infection. Objectives: In this unprecedented era of conducting clinical research during a global pandemic a Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) tool is required to (1) provide a comprehensive epidemiological understanding of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) symptoms, clustering and resolution; (2) provide data on the impact of both infection and the pandemic on people's lives; and (3) offer a full understanding of treatment benefit in studies designed to treat or vaccinate against COVID-19. Method(s): A review of the literature (March 2020) used COVID-19 and signs, symptoms and impacts search terms. A preliminary conceptual model was developed and novel PRO items were drafted. A review of social media (June 2020) informed an updated conceptual model and PRO items. Joint concept elicitation-cognitive interviews were completed with people who had experienced COVID-19 (June-July 2020). Result(s): The literature (25 articles), social media (>200 million mentions) and interviews (n=10) highlighted a heterogenous list of signs, symptoms and impacts of COVID-19 infections, and a broad list of impacts of the pandemic in general. Novel PROs are intended to be comprehensive, so the incidence and severity of 42 signs and symptoms are measured. Fifteen additional items ask about the impact of infection (physical, emotional and social) and 18 about the impact of the pandemic. The PRO is adaptive (modular) to allow administration to people with and without COVID-19 infection. Weekly- and daily-recall versions were tested in cognitive interviews resulting in adjustments to ensure understandability. Conclusion(s): Novel content-valid PROs have been developed to measure the signs, symptoms and impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and infection. These are currently being employed in a large longitudinal study to evaluate their psychometric measurement properties.Copyright © 2020	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 Infection as a trigger of autoimmune response. Nowadays, few evidences have shown the possible involvement of autoimmunity in patients affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we elucidate whether severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) stimulates autoantibody production and contributes to autoimmunity activation. We enrolled 40 adult patients (66.8 years mean age) admitted to Alessandria hospital between March and April 2020. All the patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and no previously clinical record of autoimmune disease. 40 blood donors were analyzed for the same markers and considered as healthy controls. Our patients had high levels of common inflammatory markers, such as C Reactive Protein, Lactate Dehydrogenase, ferritin and creatinine. Interleukin-6 concentrations were also increased, supporting the major role of this interleukin during COVID-19 infection. Lymphocytes number were generally lower compared to healthy individuals. All the patients were also screened for the most common autoantibodies. We found a significant prevalence of ANA, ANCA and ASCA IgA antibodies. We observed that patients having a de novo autoimmune response had the worst acute viral disease prognosis and outcome. Our results sustain the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection correlates with the autoimmunity markers. Our study might help clinicians to: a) better understand the heterogeneity of this pathology and b) correctly evaluate COVID-19 clinical manifestations. Our data explained why drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases may also be useful for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we highly recommend checking COVID-19 patients for autoimmunity markers, mainly when deciding on whether to treat them with plasma transfer therapy.

0	COVID-19-associated encephalitis successfully treated with combination therapy. Background: Acute encephalitis can occur in different viral diseases due to infection of the brain or by an immune mechanism. Severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation including interleukin 6 (IL-6). We report a case presenting with acute encephalitis that was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with hyperinflammatory systemic response and recovered after therapy with immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade. Case report: A 39-year-old-man was brought to the Emergency Department with drowsiness, mental disorientation, intermittent fever and headache. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive involvement of the brain including cortical and subcortical right frontal regions, right thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes and cerebral peduncles, with no leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 20/microL (90% lymphocytes), protein level of 198 mg/dL, and glucose of 48 mg/dL. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) but it was negative in the CSF. Remarkable laboratory findings in blood tests included low lymphocyte count and elevated ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer. He had a complicated clinical course requiring mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were added considering acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The patient made a full recovery, suggesting that it could have been related to host inflammatory response. Conclusion(s): This case report indicates that COVID-19 may present as an encephalitis syndrome mimicking acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis that could be amenable to therapeutic modulation.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Personal protective practices and pharmacy services delivery by community pharmacists during COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a national survey. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID19) has adversely affected the delivery of various health services. Little is known about the impact of COVID19 on pharmacy services across the United Kingdom (UK). We surveyed community pharmacists across the UK to understand their protective practices, professional and general well-being, and the delivery of pharmacy services during the COVID19 pandemic., METHODS: Community pharmacists were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey via the nationwide weekly newsletter of Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and the local pharmaceutical committees during the second week of May 2020. The survey remained open for 4 weeks., RESULTS: A total of 206 pharmacists responded to the survey with representations from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The majority of pharmacists (>75% or above) reported an increase in customer traffic to their pharmacy and were asking relevant questions from patients with flu-like symptoms before signposting them to the appropriate care. Most pharmacists (>85%) were maintaining a safe distance of 2 m from customers and 72% were wearing an N95 protective mask and 28% were using protective gloves and apron in addition to safe distancing and protective masks. Ninety-nine percent of pharmacists reported drug shortages with 38% and 26% reported significant drug shortages and critical drug shortages causing disruptions beyond over the counter medicines. Eighty-nine percent pharmacists reported inappropriate behaviour from patients or carers with 31% and 16% reported it to be a regular or frequent problem, respectively. Fifty-three% of pharmacists were willing to offer their assistance for mass testing of COVID19 antibodies if adequate training and reimbursement are provided., CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists in the UK are facing considerable challenges in terms of personal protection and the delivery of pharmacy services. Inappropriate behaviour from patients and carers towards community pharmacists require urgent attention to ensure a safe working place for all community pharmacists. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Radiologic aspects of COVID-19 pneumonia: outcomes and thoracic complications. Outcomes vary widely in patients with COVID-19. Whereas some patients have only mild symptoms of short duration, others develop severe disease that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged stays in intensive care units. Radiologically, the initial stage is characterized by viral pneumonia with mild expression. In some patients, however, the onset of the immune response results in acute lung damage with organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Moderate-severe disease is associated with a high incidence of pulmonary embolisms, generally peripherally distributed and associated with endothelial damage, prolonged stays in bed, and coagulopathy. Other relatively common complications are spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum due to the rupture of alveolar walls and barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. Superinfection, generally bacterial and less commonly fungal, is more common in patients with severe disease. Copyright © 2020 SERAM. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.	false
0	Characterization of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Review and meta-analysis. Characterization of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been partially carried out. There has been no systematic review providing a holistic neonatal presentation including possible vertical transmission. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science up to June, 6 2020. Studies on neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. A binary random effect model was used for prevalence and 95% confidence interval. 32 studies involving 261 neonates were included in meta-analysis. Most neonates born to infected mothers did not show any clinical abnormalities (80.4%). Clinical features were dyspnea in 11 (42.3%) and fever in 9 newborns (19.1%). Of 261 neonates, 120 neonates were tested for infection, of whom 12 (10.0%) tested positive. Swabs from placenta, cord blood and vaginal secretion were negative. Neonates are mostly non affected by the mother's SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of vertical transmission is low. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Systematic review of reviews of symptoms and signs of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a systematic review of reviews of the prevalence of symptoms and signs of COVID-19 in those aged under 20 years., DESIGN: Narrative systematic review of reviews. PubMed, medRxiv, Europe PMC and COVID-19 Living Evidence Database were searched on 9 October 2020., SETTING: All settings, including hospitalised and community settings., PATIENTS: Children and young people (CYP) under age 20 years with laboratory-proven COVID-19., STUDY REVIEW, DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY: Potentially eligible articles were reviewed on title and abstract by one reviewer. Quality was assessed using the modified AMSTARS criteria and data were extracted from included studies by two reviewers., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of symptoms and signs of COVID-19., RESULTS: 1325 studies were identified and 18 reviews were included. Eight were high quality, 7 medium and 3 low quality. All reviews were dominated by studies of hospitalised children. The proportion of asymptomatic CYP ranged from 14.6% to 42%. Fever and cough were the the most common symptoms; proportions with fever ranged from 46% to 64.2% and with cough from 32% to 55.9%. All other symptoms or signs including rhinorrhoea, sore throat, headache, fatigue/myalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea and vomiting were infrequent, occurring in less than 10%-20%., CONCLUSIONS: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in CYP with COVID-19, with other symptoms infrequent. Further research on symptoms in community samples are needed to inform pragmatic identification and testing programmes for CYP. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	A case series report of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection in Jinan, China. In December 2019, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection was reported in Wuhan, China. The disease has spread rapidly throughout China and the rest of the world. It not only occurred in adults but also in some children. So, in this report, we aimed to clarify the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics; treatment; and outcomes of children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in Jinan, China, and found that children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection are non-specific and are milder than adults. Asymptomatic infections were common. Chest computed tomographic scanning is helpful for diagnosis. While myocardial creatine kinase-myocardial band was prone to increase in these cases. The prognosis of most cases was better. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

Com os primeiros casos de HIV/AIDS no inicio dos anos 80 medidas foram tomadas para garantir a qualidade dos suprimentos de sangue. Dentre elas a proibicao de homens que tiveram sexo com homens (HSH) de doar sangue foi imediatamente adotada. O questionamento das politicas de restricao a doacao de sangue decorre de perspectivas quanto a defesa dos direitos humanos, promocao de igualdade e cidadania e alegacao de discriminacao. Atraves de pesquisa bibliografica buscou-se elucidar o historico e a evolucao da legislacao relacionada ao tema ate os dias atuais. Atualmente politicas regulatorias para recrutamento e selecao de doadores de sangue foram estabelecidas de modo a minimizar o risco de transmissao de infeccoes atraves de transfusao de sangue. Entretanto, com o avanco das tecnologias de analise do sangue e a era NAT, que reduz o periodo de janela imunologica para deteccao de agentes transmissores de doencas infecciosas, questiona-se o adiamento da doacao de sangue por esta populacao. As razoes e beneficios para a restricao a doacao por HSH vem sendo questionados por organizacoes ligadas a comunidade LGTB, desde que, quase quarenta anos apos as primeiras legislacoes, os metodos de triagem avancaram e a possibilidade de contaminacao por HIV por transfusao sanguinea e extremamente baixa. Com as novas tecnologias, a deteccao de doencas transmissiveis pelo sangue se tornou possivel em estagio inicial, o que seria um argumento para a flexibilizacao da inaptidao da doacao de sangue por HSH, desejosos em contribuir para a preparacao de desastres e fortalecimento no fornecimento de sangue. No entanto, a persistencia de um periodo de janela imunologica, alem da emergencia de outras doencas transmitidas pelo sangue desde a descoberta da AIDS, que se demonstraram mais prevalentes nesta populacao, reforcam o argumento cientifico para a manutencao das politicas restricao. Os paises tem adotado tres principais estrategias sobre esta questao: (a) inaptidao permanente apos qualquer relacao sexual entre homens; (b) inaptidao temporaria, entre tres meses a dez anos apos a ultima relacao sexual entre homens e (c) avaliacao de comportamento de risco baseado em criterios, independentemente da opcao sexual. O processo para mudancas dessas politicas envolve avaliacoes, governamentais e externas, das percepcoes publicas de risco e confianca no sistema do sangue, alem da avaliacao dos novos riscos gerados por essas alteracoes. Num historico muito recente, a pandemia por COVID-19 trouxe desafios muito grandes aos estoques de suprimentos sanguineos nos Estados Unidos. Diante disso o FDA, baseado em estudos epidemiologicos recentes, onde se verificou que mudancas nos criterios de elegibilidade dos doadores nao comprometeria a seguranca do sangue, passou a restricao de doacao dos HSH de 12 meses para 3 meses a partir de abril de 2020. Em maio de 2020 o Superior Tribunal Federal (STF) brasileiro decidiu, por maioria de votos, derrubar restricoes a doacao de sangue por homens que fazem sexo com homens. Tornando desta forma as normas do Ministerio da Saude e da Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (Anvisa) inconstitucionais. Publicada em 08 de julho de 2020, a RDC ndegree 399 revoga esta restricao em cumprimento a ordem judicial. O desafio ainda e como avancar nos criterios de selecao de doadores e minimizar tempo de restricao, mantendo a seguranca do sangue e a confianca das pessoas.Copyright © 2020	false

This study was performed to evaluate concentration of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to monitor treatment response of COVID -19 patients at the post hospitalization period. Results of present study revealed that there significant increases in patients showing abnormal values for the LDH, CRP, and ferritin; but not for D-dimer that decreased significantly. Higher elevation (P<0.0001) in concentration of blood biomarkers was detected among the group of abnormal values when compared to the group of normal values of study patients. In addition, the concentration of D-dimer had showed a significant higher concentration in patients with abnormal values. Concerning time-required recovery and age factors, we showed that the patients required 4-30 (13.35+/-0.65) days for recovery; while the age of study population was ranged 26-95 (54.85+/-1.57) years and the percentage of COVID-19 patients were increased with the advancing of age. Relation to gender factor, abnormal values of study biomarkers reported that there no significant differences (P>0.05) between males and females. Among three study age groups (<=39, 40-59, and >=60 years), the findings of study biomarkers showed insignificant differences (P>0.05) in concentration of D-dimer, CRP, and LDH; but not in concentration of ferritin that increased significantly (P<=0.0065) at the group of 40-59 years. As well as the findings of time-required recovery found that there insignificant variation (0<=0.084) between the study age groups. In conclusion, our study found a significant prevalence of abnormal values and significant elevation in concentration of blood biomarkers, particularly Di-dimer, in recovered COVID-19 patients indicating the potential high risk of infection. Therefore, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave post the course of the disease could help in identifying severe disease and subsequently improve prognosis. Nevertheless, we urge for more research across the globe to corroborate these findings.Copyright © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.	false
0	"Aerosol Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Physical Principles and Implications. Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted airborne in aerosol particles as well as in larger droplets or by surface deposits. This minireview outlines the underlying aerosol science, making links to aerosol research in other disciplines. SARS-CoV-2 is emitted in aerosol form during normal breathing by both asymptomatic and symptomatic people, remaining viable with a half-life of up to about an hour during which air movement can carry it considerable distances, although it simultaneously disperses. The proportion of the droplet size distribution within the aerosol range depends on the sites of origin within the respiratory tract and on whether the distribution is presented on a number or volume basis. Evaporation and fragmentation reduce the size of the droplets, whereas coalescence increases the mean droplet size. Aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 can also coalesce with pollution particulates, and infection rates correlate with pollution. The operation of ventilation systems in public buildings and transportation can create infection hazards via aerosols, but provides opportunities for reducing the risk of transmission in ways as simple as switching from recirculated to outside air. There are also opportunities to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form with sunlight or UV lamps. The efficiency of masks for blocking aerosol transmission depends strongly on how well they fit. Research areas that urgently need further experimentation include the basis for variation in droplet size distribution and viral load, including droplets emitted by ""superspreader"" individuals; the evolution of droplet sizes after emission, their interaction with pollutant aerosols and their dispersal by turbulence, which gives a different basis for social distancing.

0	Current Status of Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Future Developments: A Review. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid.	false
0	B Cell Subsets as Severity-Associated Signatures in COVID-19 Patients. Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a global health problem that has affected millions of people. The fine host immune response and its association with the disease course have not yet been fully elucidated. Consequently, we analyze circulating B cell subsets and their possible relationship with COVID-19 features and severity., Methods: Using a multiparametric flow cytometric approach, we determined B cell subsets frequencies from 52 COVID-19 patients, grouped them by hierarchical cluster analysis, and correlated their values with clinical data., Results: The frequency of CD19+ B cells is increased in severe COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Specific subset frequencies such as transitional B cell subsets increase in mild/moderate cases but decrease with the severity of the disease. Memory B compartment decreased in severe and critical cases, and antibody-secreting cells are increased according to the severity of the disease. Other non-typical subsets such as double-negative B cells also showed significant changes according to disease severity. Globally, these differences allow us to identify severity-associated patient clusters with specific altered subsets. Finally, respiratory parameters, biomarkers of inflammation, and clinical scores exhibited correlations with some of these subpopulations., Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 is accompanied by changes in the B cell subpopulations, either immature or terminally differentiated. Furthermore, the existing relationship of B cell subset frequencies with clinical and laboratory parameters suggest that these lymphocytes could serve as potential biomarkers and even active participants in the adaptive antiviral response mounted against SARS-CoV-2.

0	Association of metformin with mortality or ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study. AIMS: To determine the association between metformin use and mortality and ARDS incidence in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes., METHODS: This study was a multi-center retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes and admitted to four hospitals in Hubei province, China from December 31st, 2019 to March 31st, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their exposure to metformin during hospitalization. The outcomes of interest were 30-day all-cause mortality and incidence of ARDS. We used mixed-effect Cox model and random effect logistic regression to evaluate the associations of metformin use with outcomes, adjusted for baseline characteristics., RESULTS: Of 328 patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes included in the study cohort, 30.5% (100/328) were in the metformin group. In the mixed-effected model, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS. There was no significant association between metformin use and 30-day all-cause mortality. Propensity score-matched analysis confirmed the results. In the subgroup analysis, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS in females., CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may have potential benefits in reducing the incidence of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes. However, this benefit differs significantly by gender. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to large proportions of the labour market moving to remote work, while others have become unemployed. Those still at their physical workplace likely face increased risk of infection, compared to other workers. The objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between working arrangements, infection control programs (ICP), and symptoms of anxiety and depression among Canadian workers, not specifically working in healthcare., METHODS: A convenience-based internet survey of Canadian non-healthcare workers was facilitated through various labour organizations between April 26 and June 6, 2020. A total of 5180 respondents started the survey, of which 3779 were assessed as employed in a full-time or part-time capacity on 2 March 2020 (prior to large-scale COVID-19 pandemic responses in Canada). Of this sample, 3305 (87.5%) had complete information on main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-2), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire screener (PHQ-2). For workers at their physical workplace (site-based workers) we asked questions about the adequacy and implementation of 11 different types of ICP, and the adequacy and supply of eight different types of personal protective equipment (PPE). Respondents were classified as either: working remotely; site-based workers with 100% of their ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with 50-99% of ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with 1-49% of ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with none of ICP/PPE needs met; or no longer employed. Regression analyses examined the association between working arrangements and ICP/PPE adequacy and having GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of three and higher (a common screening point in both scales). Models were adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific factors., RESULTS: A total of 42.3% (95% CI: 40.6-44.0%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 34.6% (95% CI: 32.-36.2%) had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. In initial analyses, symptoms of anxiety and depression were lowest among those working remotely (35.4 and 27.5%), compared to site-based workers (43.5 and 34.7%) and those who had lost their jobs (44.1 and 35.9%). When adequacy of ICP and PPE was taken into account, the lowest prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was observed among site-based workers with all of their ICP needs being met (29.8% prevalence for GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 23.0% prevalence for PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher), while the highest prevalence was observed among site-based workers with none of their ICP needs being met (52.3% for GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 45.8% for PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher)., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the adequate design and implementation of employer-based ICP have implications for the mental health of site-based workers. As economies re-open the ongoing assessment of ICP and associated mental health outcomes among the workforce is warranted. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	The Association Between the Level of Serum 25(OH) Vitamin D, Obesity, and underlying Diseases with the risk of Developing COVID-19 Infection: A case-control study of hospitalized patients in Tehran, Iran. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the predisposing factors of this infection. The aim of the current study was to explore an association between the serum vitamin D level, obesity and underlying health conditions, and the vulnerability to COVID-19 in the Iranian population., METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 201 patients with coronavirus infection and 201 controls. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender. The study was carried out for 2 months (February 2020 to April 2020) at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Information containing age, gender, clinical symptoms, body mass index (BMI), CT scan findings, and underlying health conditions related to each participant were elicited from health records., RESULTS: A significant negative correlation (p = 0.02) was observed between the serum vitamin D level and developing coronavirus infection. Also, the results showed that the COVID-19 cases were more likely to be overweight than the controls (p=0.023). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and respiratory infections were found in 20.89%, 9.65%, and 6.96 % of cases, respectively. These underlying health conditions were not significantly different between cases and controls (p= 0.8111)., CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and obesity are two main predisposing factors associated with the vulnerability to coronavirus infection in Iranian population.

0	Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in 199 Patients. OBJECTIVE: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with its new quantitative mapping techniques has proved to be an essential diagnostic tool for detecting myocardial injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This systematic review sought to assess the important imaging features on CMR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review within the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and WHO databases for articles describing the CMR findings in COVID-19 patients., RESULTS: A total of 34 studies comprising 199 patients were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Of the CMRs 21% were normal. Myocarditis (40.2%) was the most prevalent diagnosis. T1 (109/150; 73%) and T2 (91/144; 63%) mapping abnormalities, edema on T2/STIR (46/90; 51%), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (85/199; 43%) were the most common imaging findings. Perfusion deficits (18/21; 85%) and extracellular volume mapping abnormalities (21/40; 52%), pericardial effusion (43/175; 24%), and pericardial LGE (22/100; 22%) were also seen. LGE was most commonly seen in the subepicardial location (81%) and in the basal-mid part of the left ventricle in inferior segments. In most of the patients, ventricular functions were normal. Kawasaki-like involvement with myocardial edema without necrosis/LGE (4/6; 67%) was seen in children., CONCLUSION: CMR is useful in assessing the prevalence, mechanism, and extent of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocarditis is the most common imaging diagnosis, with the common imaging findings being mapping abnormalities and myocardial edema on T2, followed by LGE. As cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor prognosis, its detection warrants prompt attention and appropriate treatment.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Clinique Ngaliema, a public hospital in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Clinique Ngaliema, a public hospital, in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)., METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection., RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38-64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate. Regression model revealed that older age, lower SpO2, higher heart rate and elevated AST at admission were all risk factors associated with in-hospital death. The prevalence of COVID-19 and malaria co-infection was 0.63% and 70 (44%) of all patients received antimalarial treatment before hospitalization., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the epidemiological and clinical feature of COVID-19 patients in Kinshasa are broadly similar to previous reports from other settings. Older age, lower SpO2, tachycardia, and elevated AST could help to identify patients at higher risk of death at an early stage of the illness. Plasmodium spp co-infection was not common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Microfluidic immunoassay for detection of serological antibodies: A potential tool for rapid evaluation of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 became a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries and territories. Millions of lives are still affected because of mandatory quarantines, which hamstring economies and induce panic. Immunology plays a major role in the modern field of medicine, especially against virulent infectious diseases. In this field, neutralizing antibodies are heavily studied because they reflect the level of infection and individuals' immune status, which are essential when considering resumption of work, flight travel, and border entry control. More importantly, it also allows evaluating the antiviral vaccine efficacy as vaccines are still known for being the ultimate intervention method to inhibit the rapid spread of virulent infectious diseases. In this Review, we first introduce the host immune response after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the latest results using conventional immunoassays. Next, as an enabling platform for detection with sufficient sensitivity while saving analysis time and sample size, the progress of microfluidic-based immunoassays is discussed and compared based on surface modification, microfluidic kinetics, signal output, signal amplification, sample matrix, and the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Based on the overall comparison, this Review concludes by proposing the future integration of visual quantitative signals on microfluidic devices as a more suitable approach for general use and large-scale surveillance.

0	Human Leukocyte Antigen Complex and Other Immunogenetic and Clinical Factors Influence Susceptibility or Protection to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Severity of the Disease Course. The Sardinian Experience. Aim: SARS-CoV-2 infection is a world-wide public health problem. Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome., Method and Materials: We recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies., Results: Male sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency. None of these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively common finding in the Sardinian population. The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0-0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8-8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95% CI 2.7-220.6), Pc = 0.024]., Conclusion: The data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait. Absence of influenza vaccination could be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.

0	[Novel coronavirus infection COVID-19: extrapulmonary manifestations]. The novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 in most cases manifests with respiratory symptoms and fever, however, some patients may have cardiovascular and gastroenterological manifestations. A feature of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 is the development of pronounced immunopathological reactions and disorders of hemostasis, leading to the development of a wide range of cardiovascular complications. The course of COVID-19 may be complicated by the development of acute myocardial infarction, venous and arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in various vascular pools, the development of acute myocardial damage and myocarditis. Among the gastroenterological manifestations, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, as well as abdominal pain, are most often detected. These symptoms may precede the appearance of respiratory signs of the disease, and in some cases come to the fore in the clinical picture of the disease. In addition, in some patients there are laboratory signs of liver injury (increased serum transaminases). The exact pathogenesis of the above disorders continues to be studied.	false
0	Control of a Nosocomial Outbreak of COVID-19 in a University Hospital. Background: Nosocomial spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes clusters of infection among high-risk individuals. Controlling this spread is critical to reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We describe an outbreak of COVID-19 in Keio University Hospital, Japan, and its control and propose effective control measures., Methods: When an outbreak was suspected, immediate isolation and thorough polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of patients and health care workers (HCWs) using an in-house system, together with extensive contact tracing and social distancing measures, were conducted. Nosocomial infections (NIs) were defined as having an onset or positive test after the fifth day of admission for patients and having high-risk contacts in our hospital for HCWs. We performed descriptive analyses for this outbreak., Results: Between March 24 and April 24, 2020, 27 of 562 tested patients were confirmed positive, of whom 5 (18.5%) were suspected as NIs. For HCWs, 52 of 697 tested positive, and 40 (76.9%) were considered NIs. Among transmissions, 95.5% were suspected of having occurred during the asymptomatic period. Large-scale isolation and testing at the first sign of outbreak terminated NIs. The number of secondary cases directly generated by a single primary case found before March 31 was 1.74, compared with 0 after April 1. Only 4 of 28 primary cases generated definite secondary infection; these were all asymptomatic., Conclusions: Viral shedding from asymptomatic cases played a major role in NIs. PCR screening of asymptomatic individuals helped clarify the pattern of spread. Immediate large-scale isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing measures were essential to containing outbreaks. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Natural SARS-CoV-2 infections, including virus isolation, among serially tested cats and dogs in households with confirmed human COVID-19 cases in Texas, USA. The natural infections and epidemiological roles of household pets in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not understood. We conducted a longitudinal study of dogs and cats living with at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected human in Texas and found 47.1% of 17 cats and 15.3% of 59 dogs from 25.6% of 39 households were positive for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR and genome sequencing or neutralizing antibodies. Virus was isolated from one cat. The majority (82.4%) of infected pets were asymptomatic. Re-sampling of one infected cat showed persistence of viral RNA at least 32 d-post human diagnosis (25 d-post initial test). Across 15 antibody-positive animals, titers increased (33.3%), decreased (33.3%) or were stable (33.3%) over time. A One Health approach is informative for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	false
0	Evaluation of serum IgM and IgG antibodies in COVID-19 patients by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 is sweeping the world since the end of 2019. The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated., METHOD: An ELISA was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies., RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at month 3 in 30% patients and negative at month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of RT-qPCR on day 7 and 4., CONCLUSION: The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies couldn't maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months. Our data will help develop the diagnosis and vaccine of SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Persistence of symptoms and quality of life at 35 days after hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: Characterizing the prevalence and persistence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection following hospitalization and their impact is essential to planning post-acute community-based clinical services. This study seeks to identify persistent COVID-19 symptoms in patients 35 days post-hospitalization and their impact on quality of life, health, physical, mental, and psychosocial function., METHODS AND FINDINGS: This prospective cohort study used the PROMIS R Instruments to identify symptoms and quality of life parameters in consecutively enrolled patients between March 22 and April 16, 2020, in New Jersey. The 183 patients (median age 57 years; 61.5% male, 54.1% white) reported persistent symptoms at 35 days, including fatigue (55.0%), dyspnea (45.3%), muscular pain (51%), associated with a lower odds rating general health (41.5%, OR 0.093 [95% CI: 0.026, 0.329], p = 0.0002), quality of life (39.8%; OR 0.116 [95% CI: 0.038, 0.364], p = 0.0002), physical health (38.7%, OR 0.055 [95% CI: 0.016, 0.193], p <0.0001), mental health (43.7%, OR 0.093 [95% CI: 0.021, 0.418], p = 0.0019) and social active role (38.7%, OR 0.095 [95% CI: 0.031, 0.291], p<0.0001), as very good/excellent, particularly adults aged 65 to 75 years (OR 8.666 [95% CI: 2.216, 33.884], p = 0.0019)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 symptoms commonly persist to 35 days, impacting quality of life, health, physical and mental function. Early post-acute evaluation of symptoms and their impact on function is necessary to plan community-based services.	false
0	[Association of D-dimer, inflammatory markers, cytokines abnormality, and disease severity in COVID-19 severe/critical patients in Wuhan]. Objective: To analyze the association of D-dimer levels, inflammatory indicators, cytokine abnormality, and disease severity in COVID-19 severe/critical type patients. Methods: The medical records of 41 patients were collected from a single center in Wuhan from February 8, 2020 to March 25, 2020. The patients were divided into severe type group (28 patients) and critical type group (13 patients) . The levels of D-dimer, WBC, ANC, PCT, hsCRP, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were compared among patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the changes in the cytokines were analyzed in patients with different D-dimer levels. And, the levels of D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha before and after anticoagulant therapy were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 41 patients, 23 were men (56.1%) and 18 were women (43.9%) ; the median patient age was 57 y. The age of the critical type patients [ (61.1+/-10.4) y] was higher than that of severe type patients [ (52.8+/-11.7) y]; the difference was significant (t=-2.264, P=0.032) . The proportion of critical type patients with chronic diseases, especially hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, was higher as compared to that in those with severe type patients; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . The prevalence of dyspnea, sweats, and fatigue symptoms in the critical type patients was higher than that in those with severe type disease; the differences were significant (chi(2)=14.898, 6.972, 7.823; P<0.001, 0.008, 0.005) . The levels of D-dimer, WBC, ANC, PCT, hsCRP, and IL-8 in critical type patients were higher than those in severe type patients; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . The levels of IL-2R, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in patients with abnormal D-dimer were higher as compared to those in patients with normal D-dimer levels; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . Eight patients were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation; the levels of D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6 and IL-8 after anticoagulant therapy were lower than those before treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 critical type patients have more serious coagulation-immune dysfunction and dynamic monitoring of D-dimer and cytokines levels helps in identifying critical type patients as early as possible; anticoagulant therapy may improve the patient's condition by correcting coagulation-immune dysfunction.	false

0	Impact of cardiovascular disease and risk factors on fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 according to age: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder. We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50-60 years and >=60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death., RESULTS: We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former., CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020198152.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a widely prevalent yet manageable condition that has been linked to neurocognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple barriers hinder older individuals from being diagnosed with ARHL through pure-tone audiometry. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the closure of many outpatient audiology and otolaryngology offices. Smartphone-based hearing assessment apps may overcome these challenges by enabling patients to remotely self-administer their own hearing exam. The objective of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of current mobile health applications (apps) that claim to assess hearing., DESIGN: Narrative review., METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were queried for apps that claimed to assess hearing. Relevant apps were downloaded and used to conduct a mock hearing assessment. Names of included apps were searched on four literature databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) to determine which apps had been validated against gold standard methods., RESULTS: App store searches identified 44 unique apps. Apps differed with respect to the type of test offered (e.g., hearing threshold test), cost, strategies to reduce ambient noise, test output (quantitative vs qualitative results), and options to export results. Validation studies were identified for seven apps., CONCLUSION: Given their low cost and relative accessibility, smartphone-based hearing apps may facilitate screening for ARHL, particularly in the setting of limitations on in-person medical care due to COVID-19. However, app features vary widely, few apps have been validated, and user-centered designs for older adults are largely lacking. Further research and validation efforts are necessary to determine whether smartphone-based hearing assessments are a feasible and accurate screening tool for ARHL.

Objectives: Dynamic and fast actions are needed to suppress the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has affected every sector of human life. Our objective was to develop an open-access, interactive tool for policy makers to inform timely decisions and evaluate the impact of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (of varied intensity and timing) on reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the. Method(s): We developed a compartmental model, the COVID-19 Simulator, to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 in 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. The model is defined using Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered compartments (SEIR model) with continuous time progression. Input data included reported state-specific daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths; disease epidemiology parameters estimated by clinical studies, state-specific effective reproduction numbers, testing rates, and changes in mobility as reported by GPS location data. Unobserved parameters were calibrated using generalized simulated annealing to match the daily reported cases and deaths. We projected future cases of COVID-19, active cases of COVID-19, deaths, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions under different levels of social-distancing measures (minimal restrictions, current intervention, stay-at-home orders, and lockdown). Result(s): The COVID-19 Simulator can help users to understand the implications, including deaths and hospital beds needed, of removing or adding restrictions at different time points. Under current intervention levels, new cases per day are projected to surpass 100,000 by September in the US; implementing stay at home orders again in many states is necessary to create a downward trajectory in incidence. High prevalence states may see a dramatic increase in deaths by Fall if policies do not change. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 Simulator provides an interactive platform to inform policy decisions on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The simulator is updated on a regular basis as new data become available and will be extended to inform new policy-relevant questions.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Zooming to a cure: Harnessing telemedicine to offer mobile hepatitis C testing and treatment. Background: Despite the availability of highly effective directacting antiviral (DAA) therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV), people who use illicit drugs or are experiencing homelessness face multiple barriers to accessing HCV treatment The aim of this project was to assess the feasibility and outcomes of offering low-threshold HCV treatment via telemedicine on a mobile HCV screening van Methods: In January 2019, we launched a mobile HCV screening van, offering free rapid HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory HCV RNA testing and Fibroscan for fibrosis staging at multiple sites in San Francisco (figure). In August 2019, we began offering linkage to an HCV clinician via telemedicine visits conducted with the patient utilizing a computer on the van Pre-treatment labs were drawn on the van, and DAAs were brought to the van for patients to pick-up Treatment initiation and other visits were all conducted via telemedicine on the van, and labs were drawn on the van during and after treatment Staff provided individualized appointment reminders, treatment plans, and strategies for safe medication storage Results: From 8/2019- 3/2020, 190 people were screened for HCV at 3 locations, and 32 (17%) tested positive for HCV RNA Sixteen patients elected to see a clinician via telemedicine on the van, and all initiated DAA therapy Median age of treated patients was 54 years, 56% were male, and 56 % were non-white All had a history of injection drug use, and most reported current injection or non-injection drug use Half were unstably housed, with 44% reporting staying at a shelter, outside, or in a vehicle Mental health comorbidities were common (56%), and 19% were HIV co-infected Three had compensated cirrhosis (19%), and 94% were treatment naive All had health insurance, but those needing a hepatology visit prior authorization waited longer from time of HCV RNA testing to starting treatment compared to those who did not: mean 76 +/- 52 days vs 57 +/- 31 days Thirteen patients completed treatment: SVR12 was confirmed in 7, SVR12 labs were delayed in 5 due to COVID-19, and 1 is awaiting SVR12 date One patient remains on treatment, and 2 received all of their medications but were lost to followup during COVID-19 Conclusion(s): Community-based HCV treatment via telemedicine on a mobile van is feasible and enables clinicians to treat patients where they are This model could be adapted in other community-based settings to colocalize HCV treatment with other services.

0	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without pre-existing chronic liver disease. Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often present with various degrees of liver injury Thus, patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (LD) may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19, but this has not yet been well characterized Aim: To examine the impact of pre-existing LD on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Johns Hopkins Health System between February 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19 Identified patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of pre-existing LD The LD group consisted of patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing liver disease at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 We studied outcomes, including the need for hemodialysis or vasopressor support, hospital length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality We described categorical data as percentages, and continuous data as mean with standard error (SD) We used Pearson's chi-squared tests and analysis of variance to compare variables between the patients with and without LD Results: In a study of 2,293 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, 129 (17.8%) patients had pre-existing LD Among them, 32 (24 8%) patients had cirrhosis; 18 (14 0%) had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; 20 (15 5%) had chronic hepatitis C; 5 (3 87%) had chronic hepatitis B, and 5 (3 87%) were liver transplant recipients Patients with LD were more often black (41 9%) compared to patients with no preexisting LD (35 1%, p = 0 029) LD patients had substantially higher prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension (79 9% vs 61%, p < 0 001), diabetes (27 9% vs 15 6%, p < 0 001), chronic pulmonary disease (31 0% vs 18 4%, p < 0 0001), and anemia (43 4% vs 22%, p < 0 001) Those with LD required hemodialysis more often (10% vs 4 4%, p = 0 015) There was no difference in need for vasopressor support (20 0% vs 18 8%, p = 0 12) The hospital LOS was similar between the groups (9 5 vs 9 6 days) There was no difference in mortality between the two groups (10 0% vs 14 6%, p = 0 14) Conclusion(s): Patients with pre-existing LD and COVID-19 infection were more likely black, have underlying comorbidities and require hemodialysis However, they had similar hospital LOS and mortality as those without LD. These findings have important implications for patients with LD but require further validation.	false
0	PIN115 Understanding Sars-COV-2 Mortality: IMPACT of Population and Mobility Metrics. Objectives: Published mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infections have varied significantly due to differences in testing and disease tracking rates across countries. The impact of population density, family size, mobility and government actions on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections is not well understood. Method(s): This is a retrospective data analysis using the Worldwide WHO situation reports along with population density information and family size information (from ), government response data (7 policies: school closure (SC), workplace closure (WC), public event cancellation (PEC), restriction on gatherings (RG), public transport closure (PTC), stay-at-home (SAH), internal movement restrictions (IMR) - Oxford University) and mobility reports (Apple) to estimate variables associated with COVID-19 mortality from countries with complete information. Poisson regression models were developed to evaluate associations between mortality counts and variables mentioned herein. A 42-day lag was applied to mobility and government response metrics to evaluate the impact thereof on mortality. Result(s): Nine countries were included in the analysis (Australia, Belgium, Chile, Italy, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Spain, UK, USA). The highest quartile of government response index had the greatest protective effect on mortality (incidence proportion ratio (IPR): 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.32). There was no consistent association impact between walking, driving or transit mobility metric. Government actions with significant protective effect were PTC (IPR: 0.46 (0.28-0.75)) and PEC (IPR: 0.65 (0.47-0.91)). All other government actions did not show a statistically significant association with mortality. Conclusion(s): Our study identified population metrics and government actions potentially associated with mortality, across multiple geographies. Further research on key confounders (such as mask wearing) is required to evaluate further actions to mitigate the mortality from COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Severe respiratory failure in COVID19 patients was associated with higher transaminases values during the disease outbreak. Background: Sars-Cov-2 pneumonia is a pandemic disease with high morbidity and mortality In literature transaminases were frequently found abnormal but their role has not been clarified, particularly in patients with liver disease (LD). Aim of this retrospective study is to explore the role of transaminases on short-term prognosis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients Methods: patients admitted in hospital for respiratory failure due to Sars-Cov-2 were consecutively recruited Primary endpoint: evaluate role of transaminases on disease progression (DP). Secondary endpoints: find possible risk factors for (1) mortality and (2) composite outcome consisting of DP or death Results: 135 patients included Median age was 68 years (IQR 58-74), 33 3% (n=45) were female AST/ ALT at admission and after 7 days were abnormal in about two/thirds of cases CPAP patients had transaminases more frequently abnormal (p=0 01) Transaminases alterations were predictive of DP at univariate analysis In multivariate analysis CRP at day 7 was predictor of DP (OR 3 08 and 1 08) while cardiopathy and ventilation type at admission were significantly associated with death (OR 9.95 and 11.5). Conclusion(s): This study individuates possible prognostic factors in Sars-Cov-2 pneumonia Transaminases values do not predict DP or death, even if more severe patients have a higher prevalence of transaminases elevation CRP at day 7 is a predictor of DP, while cardiopathy and type of ventilation at admission are predictive factors of short-term mortality.	false
0	Different treatment approaches, clinical outcome, effectiveness of the drug towards covid 19 with 5 different cases: A case series. An outbreak of a novel corona virus disease-19 (nCoV-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and now involved in the whole word. Globally around 20 million peoples are been infected by novel corona virus. With its staggering world wide morbidity and mortality, the scientific community has been under extra ordinary pressure to find safe and effective treatment, pending the availability of a vaccine. Certain medications, for example, dexamethasone, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiviral (remdesivir), and IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab) are used in various combinations as off-label medications to treat COVID-19. Here we are discussing 5 cases of covid 19 with different treatment approaches, and analyze the clinical outcome and effectiveness of the drug towards Covid 19.Copyright © Unauthorised republication, reproduction, distribution, dissemination and copying of this document in whole or in part is strictly prohibited.	false
0	Awareness of COVID-19 among dental students in Chennai, India- A questionnaire based study. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is a global public-health emergency. Dental professionals are considered to be at high risk, as most dental treatment procedures can lead to the spread of infection due to the direct proximity with saliva, blood and generation of aerosols. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, awareness and hygiene practices regarding COVID-19 among dental students in Chennai, India during these critical times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-administered, structured, close-ended 15-point questionnaire was distributed among the undergraduate and postgraduate dental students in Chennai. A total of 198 participants completed the questionnaire. Convenience sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as percentages. RESULT(S): Among the 198 participants a total of 54 (27.2%) exhibited high level of knowledge while 67 (33.8%) demonstrated moderate knowledge and 77 (38.8%) demonstrated low level of knowledge. Mean knowledge score was 8.5, minimum and maximum scores were 4 and 15 respectively among the dental students. CONCLUSION(S): Most the participants seemed to have inadequate knowledge about COVID19 and precautionary measures taken to prevent COVID19 from spreading. These show vulnerabilities in the knowledge of dental students to deal with the current scenario and thus, there is a need to improve the knowledge of dental students through health education and training programmes. After the condition is normalised, further research on the subject are also required.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Awareness on Preventive Measures taken by Health Care Professionals Attending COVID-19 Patients among Dental Students. OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. This virus primarily spreads through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This virus was named after its shape, which takes the form of a crown with protrusions around it. The World Health Organization has recommended personal protective equipments (PPE) to doctors and health care workers attending COVID-19 patients. PPE generally includes masks, goggles, respirators, gloves, face shields, and isolation gowns. The principle aim of this study is to create awareness among dental students about the preventive measures taken by health care professionals while attending patients affected with COVID-19., MATERIALS & METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 15 questions was created using an online Google forms website and was circulated among 100 dental students. The survey was conducted within a week in the months of April to May 2020. The results and observations were recorded in the form of pie charts., RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants have stated that health care professionals must clean their hands often, cover their nose and mouth, and maintain safe distance from everyone in order to prevent the virus from affecting them. Sixty-three percent of the participants are familiar with the term PPE. Majority assume that health care professionals are given enough safety precautions while treating a patient with coronavirus., CONCLUSION: Hence, to conclude, health care professionals play a vital role in improving access and quality health care for the population, and hence, they must be protected as well. Since dental students treat patients, they are vulnerable to infection as well, and must take proper safety measures. Copyright European Journal of Dentistry.

0	"Laboratory medicine: Create value for community health. Clinical laboratories are at a cross-roads. The focus on automation, distorted economics which subordinated medical objectives to economic ones turning the laboratory into a mega-factory, has resulted in the devaluation of laboratory medicine which is considered a support service rather than a true clinical department. However, in addition to a series of papers and visionary opinions, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia has highlighted the central role of clinical laboratories as a vital part of the continuum of patient care and disease prevention. In fact, in the case of COVID-19, as in many other diseases and medical conditions, the diagnosis is performed by a laboratory test (rRT-PCR), many biomarkers and ""conventional"" laboratory tests play a relevant role in disease monitoring and prognostication, and serological assays are used for epidemiological surveillance. Clinicians, patients, citizens and politicians have finally realized the importance of laboratory medicine and the need for implementing a more value-based patient centric model for delivering laboratory services, Moving from the traditional to a value-based model of organizing medical laboratory practices requires a) a patient centric view; b) integration with other clinical services e.g.imaging); c) optimized test request and utilization; d) focus on all phases of testing cycle, not only on the intra-analytical; e) aggregation of ""big data""; f) use of artificial intelligence to improve the value of laboratory information; and g) the promotion of precision and personalized medicine. To improve outcomes for populations and individual patients requires laboratory professionals to increase their scope of practices influence outside the traditional laboratory model to diagnostic management throughout clinical care pathways, interdisciplinary collaborations to break down traditional practice silos, and outcomes research. Diagnostic stewardship, teleconsultations, integration in diagnostic management teams, efforts in improving patient safety using appropriate quality indicators are valuable tools in order to create value and improve the visibility of laboratory professionals."	false
0	Hepatic steatosis is associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but not elevated bilirubin or hepatic decompensation in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Possible association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and worse COVID-19 disease progression has been suggested but not well described in the United States We investigated whether COVID-19 was associated with elevations in liver enzymes or hepatic decompensation in patients with underlying hepatic steatosis Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of consecutive adults treated at the University of Michigan for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Hepatic steatosis was defined based on imaging >30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes were: (1) peak ALT or bilirubin following COVID-19 diagnosis, (2) ALT >2 or 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), defined as the higher of baseline ALT or 19 U/L in women and 30 U/L in men, and (3) jaundice defined as bilirubin >2 or 4 mg/dl We conducted regressions with the above outcomes as dependent variables and hepatic steatosis as the primary predictor These regression models were logistic for outcomes of abnormal ALT or bilirubin and linear for maximal ALT or bilirubin Results: Evidence of steatosis on prior imaging was found in 80/159 (50 3%) patients Overall, 89% of patients were hospitalized, 51% were admitted to intensive care unit, and 16% died Chronic liver disease other than NAFLD was found in 14% of patients, 5% had cirrhosis, and 2 7% had prior liver decompensation with ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy Patients with steatosis were younger, more often African-American with higher body mass index than those without steatosis Baseline ALT and total bilirubin were higher in the steatosis group Hepatic steatosis was associated with higher incidence of ALT >2x ULN (OR 2.93 [1.23-6.97]) or >5x ULN (OR 6.21 [1.45-26.62]), and with peak ALT (beta 39 7 [7 85-71 49]) Hepatic steatosis was not associated with increased bilirubin Rates of liver decompensation were very low: 1 3% and 2 5%, respectively, with no difference based on NAFLD status (p > 0.4 for both) (Table 1) Conclusion(s): Analysis from our cohort showed that NALFD is associated with acute hepatocellular injury in patients with COVID-19 Strengths of this study include granularity of data available for review Weaknesses include the observational and single-center nature of the study Larger scale multi-center studies are needed to corroborate these findings.(Table Presented).	false
0	Hepatic steatosis is associated with increased disease severity in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Possible association between hepatic steatosis (HS) and worse COVID-19 disease progression has been suggested but not well described in the United States We investigated whether patients with HS experienced worse disease outcomes from COVID-19 infection than those without Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 342 consecutive adult patients treated at the University of Michigan for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020. HS was defined as either prior imaging evidence of steatosis or hepatic steatosis index >36 for Asians or >39 for non-Asians. The primary outcome was disease severity based on admission to intensive care unit (ICU), intubation, death, or the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the predictors of ICU admission, intubation rate, or death and multivariable linear regression for disease severity on WHO ordinal scale HS was the primary predictor Results: A total of 342 patients were analyzed Median age was 63 years; 53 5% of patients were male and 44 4% Black, 52 6% required ICU admission, 34 2% required intubation, and 16% died A 178 patients (52%) had HS, who were younger (58 5 vs 66 5 years; p < 0 001), had higher body mass index (34 7 vs 26 6; p < 0 001), and had higher prevalence of diabetes (48 3% vs 37 8%; p = 0 06) than those without HS HS was independently associated with increased odds of requiring admission to the ICU (odds ratio [OR] 1 75 [1 09-2 81], p = 0 02) and intubation (OR 2 58 [1 56-4 28], p < 0 001), as well as higher WHO ordinal scale (beta 0 51 [0 11-0 92], p = 0.013). There was no significant association between HS and death (OR 0 83 [0 42-1 67], p = 0 61) (Table 1) Conclusion(s): Analysis from our cohort showed that HS is associated with worse disease outcomes, evidenced by increased odds of ICU admission, intubation rate, and WHO ordinal scale in patients with COVID-19(Table Presented).	false

Background: Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo activity against SAR-CoV-2 and favorable clinical efficacy and tolerability in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 Elevated transaminase levels are commonly seen in patients with severe COVID-19 prior to treatment Here we report safety and clinical outcomes after RDV treatment in patients with normal versus elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels Methods: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, involving hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with Sat<94% Patients with screening ALT or AST> 5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded from the study Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5 or 10 days of intravenous RDV once daily We compared patients with baseline ALT below and above the ULN based on AASLD criteria (ALT 35 U/L for males and 25 U/L for females) Covariates for adjustment included age, sex, race and baseline oxygen support Clinical recovery and all-cause mortality were evaluated using logistic regression Clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were assessed through day 28 Results: Of 397 patients treated with RDV, 215 (54%) had elevated baseline ALT Median ALT was 53 U/L (IQR: 40 - 78 U/L) in the high ALT group Patients with high ALT at time of RDV initiation were younger (median 58 vs 65 years, p<0 001), required less oxygen (p=0 02), and had longer symptom duration (median 10 vs 8 days, p<0.001) prior to first dose of RDV. Incidence of serious AEs, grade >=3 AEs, and AE leading to discontinuation were similar between groups (Table1). Grade >=3 hepatobiliary adverse events, particularly transaminase elevations, were not common but numerically higher in the high ALT group (8 8% vs 3 3%, p=0 068) Time to clinical recovery, 2-point clinical improvement, 1-point clinical improvement, room air, and death were similar between groups Conclusion(s): In severe COVID-19 patients, adverse events and clinical outcomes after RDV initiation were similar among patients with baseline normal ALT and those with elevated ALT (1-5x ULN)(Table Presented).	false
0	Mucocutaneous Disease and Related Clinical Characteristics in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C. BACKGROUND: Little is known about mucocutaneous disease in acutely-ill children and adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C., OBJECTIVE: To characterize mucocutaneous disease and its relation to clinical course among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C., METHODS: Descriptive cohort study of prospectively and consecutively hospitalized eligible patients between May 11, 2020 and June 5, 2020., RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, 4/12 (33%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform pattern, and lip mucositis. In MIS-C patients, 9/19 (47%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform, retiform purpura, targetoid and urticarial patterns, along with acral edema, lip mucositis, tongue papillitis, and conjunctivitis. COVID-19 patients with rash had less frequent respiratory symptoms, PICU admission, and invasive ventilation, as well as shorter stay (vs COVID-19 without rash). MIS-C patients with rash had less frequent PICU admission, shock, ventilation, as well as lower levels of CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and troponin (vs MIS-C without rash). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was similar for patients with and without rash in both groups. None of the MIS-C patients met criteria for Kawasaki disease., LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes., CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous disease is common among children and adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Laboratory trends observed in patients with rash may prognosticate a less severe course. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false

Objetivos: Avaliar a associacao entre a infeccao pelo SARS-CoV-2 e a sindrome inflamatoria multissistemica semelhante a doenca de Kawasaki. Material e m etodos: Revisao sistematica da literatura, composta por artigos cientificos selecionados na base de dados PubMed (n =11), publicados no ano de 2020, no idioma ingles. Foram utilizados os seguintes descritores: ""COVID-19"" e ""Kawasaki[ti]"", com os filtros: ""free full text"", ""in the last 1 year"", ""humans"", ""english"" e ""MEDLINE"". Foram selecionados 8 artigos e excluidos os estudos com analise de outras variaveis (n = 3). Resultados: A doenca de Kawasaki (DK) e uma vasculite pediatrica aguda rara e tem como principal complicacao os aneurismas das arterias coronarias. O diagnostico e baseado na presenca de: febre persistente, exantema, linfadenopatia, injecao conjuntival e alteracoes na mucosa e extremidades. De acordo com dados da pandemia da COVID-19, acreditava-se que criancas e adolescentes eram menos afetados, com um curso sintomatologico mais suave. Porem, verificou-se aumento no numero de criancas com fenotipo semelhante a DK, levando a um alerta para os profissionais e as autoridades de saude. Em um hospital universitario de Paris, foi realizado um estudo, com 21 criancas, sendo que, destas, 57% apresentavam sindrome do choque da DK e 76% miocardite, e dentre elas, 90% tinham evidencia de infeccao recente por SARS-CoV-2. Na mesma cidade, foi realizado outro estudo, com 16 pacientes. O SARS-CoV-2 foi detectado em 69% e o restante teve contato com individuo PCR-positivo. Dos 16 pacientes, 44% apresentaram miocardite. Em outro estudo, realizado em Bergamo, na Italia, foram identificados 10 casos de doenca semelhante a DK, no pico da pandemia, no pais, entre fevereiro e abril. Ja em maio, observou-se aumento de 30 vezes na incidencia de doencas do tipo DK, na mesma cidade. E no Reino Unido, pequeno grupo de criancas apresentou choque e inflamacao multissistemica, em unidades de cuidados intensivos; algumas com aneurismas na arteria coronaria e outro grupo com doenca semelhante a DK. Discussao: O estudo realizado em Paris demonstrou que a proporcao, incomumente elevada, de criancas e adolescentes afetados apresentava sintomas gastrointestinais e sindrome do choque da doenca de Kawasaki. Alem disso, o numero de casos de miocardite, evidenciado em outra pesquisa, corrobora a associacao Kawa-COVID-19. Em Bergamo, na Italia, as criancas diagnosticadas com DK, apos o inicio da pandemia da COVID-19, que mostraram evidencias de resposta imunologica ao virus, eram mais velhas e tinham taxa mais alta de envolvimento cardiaco. E no Reino Unido, algumas criancas apresentaram alteracao nas arterias coronarias, semelhante a DK. Diante disso, a doenca semelhante a Kawasaki associada a SARS-CoV-2 pode representar sindrome inflamatoria pos-infecciosa. Conclusao: O surto, em curso, de sindrome inflamatoria multissistemica, semelhante a Kawasaki, entre criancas e adolescentes, em Paris, Bergamo e no Reino Unido, provavelmente, esta associada a infeccao por SARS-CoV-2, em criancas e adolescentes.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	"QUALIFICACAO DO PLASMA CONVALESCENTE SARS-CoV-2 EM DOADORES DE SANGUE. Introducao: A pandemia relacionada ao novo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), com sua alta morbi-mortalidade, tem impulsionado um movimento de busca de tratamentos seguros e eficazes. Dentro deste contexto, a utilizacao de imunizacao passiva tem ganhado importancia. O Plasma imune ou ""convalescente"" (PC), refere-se ao plasma que e coletado de individuos apos a resolucao da infeccao e desenvolvimento de anticorpos. Alem de ja ter sido utilizado nas epidemias de Ebola e H1N1, a administracao de PC para os pacientes enfermos por SARS-CoV-2, tem sido relatado em alguns estudos, com ocorrencia de melhora de parametros clinicos e laboratoriais. A nao padronizacao deste produto e o conhecimento incipiente sobre este agente, traz uma seria de obstaculos que devem ser suplantados. O recrutamento, a elegibilidade do doador e a pesquisa e quantificacao dos anticorpos, sao alguns deles. Nao se sabe ate o momento qual a concentracao de anticorpos necessarias no PC, para que possa ser minimamente efetivo. O Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), preconiza que seja realizada pesquisa de anticorpos contra SARS-CoV-2 e sugere utilizacao de doadores que tenham titulo de anticorpos neutralizantes acima de 1/80. A pesquisa de anticorpos neutralizantes e um teste de pouco acesso na praticas clinica. Estudos tem sido feitos para correlacionar resultados de Elisa e/ou Quimioluminescencia com a presenca e titulos de anticorpos neutralizantes. Neste estudo, descrevemos a experiencia utilizando o teste de pesquisa de anticorpos SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott) com leitura de densidade optica correlacionada com titulos acima de 1/80 de anticorpos neutralizantes. Objetivo: Realizar a qualificacao de doadores quanto a existencia e intensidade de anticorpo SARS-CoV-2 IgG em doadores de sangue, a fim de fornecer terapeutica potencialmente eficaz de PC para o tratamento da COVID-19. Materiais e metodos: Foram realizados 459 testes de titulacao SARS-CoV-2 IgG em doadores de sangue do grupo H.Hemo. Os doadores testados eram homens ou mulheres nuligestas, que atendiam aos criterios para doacao de sangue, com exame confirmatorio da SARS- CoV-2 e no minimo 30 dias de resolucao dos sinais e sintomas da doenca. As amostras foram coletadas em duas situacoes: coleta somente de exames para pesquisa e qualificacao do doador para posterior doacao de plasma convalescente por aferese, ou coleta de doacao de sangue total e amostras para titulacao do plasma fresco congelado. Resultados: Dos 459 testes realizados, 333 (73%) apresentaram resultados positivos para IgG. Destes, 222 (66%) foram considerados qualificados para doacao de plasma convalescente, pois apresentaram leitura de densidade optica maior ou igual a 3,5. Este numero representa somente 47% do total de exames realizados. Conclusao: O desenvolvimento da doenca COVID-19 isoladamente nao representa um criterio seguro para qualificacao de doadores de plasma convalescente, uma vez que foram identificados pacientes com titulos baixos e ate negativos de anticorpo no plasma de doadores em mais de 50% dos candidatos.Copyright © 2020"	false

0	Reactivation of BCG inoculation site in a child with febrile exanthema of 3 days duration: an early indicator of incomplete Kawasaki disease. The aetiology of febrile exanthems in children is often difficult to distinguish clinically. A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered in infants with exanthematous fever. More perplexing is the increasing incidence of an atypical form of KD. Pathogenesis of KD remains unclear even though an aberrant response of the immune system to an unidentified pathogen is often hypothesised. A 30-fold increase in the incidence of KD in Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests an immune response to a viral trigger. We report an infant clinically diagnosed with high probability as incomplete KD, who presented with reactivation of the BCG injection site even though fever with rash was only less than 3 days duration. Echocardiography confirmed coronary artery abnormalities and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin facilitated rapid recovery. Physicians should consider a diagnosis of KD if BCG site reactivation is noted in children presenting with febrile exanthema. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020. No commercial re-use.

0	An exploratory study of selenium status in healthy individuals and in patients with COVID-19 in a south Indian population: The case for adequate selenium status. The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected millions of individuals, causing major health and economic disruptions worldwide. The pandemic is still raging, with a second and third wave in a few countries, while new infections steadily rise in India. Nutrition and immune status are two critical aspects of fighting the virus successfully. Recently, selenium status was reported to positively correlate with the survival of patients with COVID-19 compared with non-survivors. We analyzed the blood serum levels in 30 apparently healthy individuals and in 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the southern part of India. The patients showed significantly lower selenium levels of 69.2 +/- 8.7 ng/mL than controls 79.1 +/- 10.9 ng/mL. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0003). Interestingly, the control group showed a borderline level of selenium, suggesting that the level of this micronutrient is not optimum in the population studied. The results of this exploratory study pave the way for further research in a larger population and suggest that selenium supplementation may be helpful in reducing the effects of the virus.

0	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit in London: A prospective observational cohort study. BACKGROUND: Cohorts of severely ill patients with COVID-19 have been described in several countries around the globe, but to date there have been few published reports from the United Kingdom (UK). Understanding the characteristics of the affected population admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK is crucial to inform clinical decision making, research and planning for future waves of infection., METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to a large UK ICU from March to May 2020 with follow-up to June 2020. Data were collected from health records using a standardised template. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyse the factors associated with ICU survival., RESULTS: Of the 156 patients included, 112 (72%) were male, 89 (57%) were overweight or obese, 68 (44%) were from ethnic minorities, and 89 (57%) were aged over 60 years of age. 136 (87%) received mechanical ventilation, 77 (57% of those intubated) were placed in the prone position and 95 (70% of those intubated) received neuromuscular blockade. 154 (99%) patients required cardiovascular support and 44 (28%) required renal replacement therapy. Of the 130 patients with completed ICU episodes, 38 (29%) died and 92 (71%) were discharged alive from ICU. In multivariable models, age (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.07-1.21]), obesity (OR 3.06 [95% CI 1.16-8.74]), lowest P/F ratio on the first day of admission (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.67-0.98]) and PaCO2 (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.01-2.39]) were independently associated with ICU death., CONCLUSIONS: Age, obesity and severity of respiratory failure were key determinants of survival in this cohort. Multiorgan failure was prevalent. These findings are important for guiding future research and should be taken into consideration during future healthcare planning in the UK.	false
0	Picomolar SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Using Multi-Arm PEG Nanobody Constructs. Multivalent antibody constructs have a broad range of clinical and biotechnological applications. Nanobodies are especially useful as components for multivalent constructs as they allow increased valency while maintaining a small molecule size. We here describe a novel, rapid method for the generation of bi- and multivalent nanobody constructs with oriented assembly by Cu-free strain promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry (SPAAC). We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 in the low picomolar range.	false
0	Differences in Clinical Features and Laboratory Results between Adults and Children with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children accounts for a small proportion of all infections and is usually mild or asymptomatic. There are few studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and the causes of the low prevalence in children remain unclear. Herein, we compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children. Fifty-two patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were retrospectively analyzed, including 38 adults and 14 children. Their clinical information such as epidemiological exposure history, laboratory indicators, chest computed tomography (CT) performance, and number of SARS-CoV-2 positive days were analyzed and compared. In children, 5 (35.71%) had mild COVID-19 and 9 (64.29%) had common type, while, in adults, 9 (23.68%) cases were mild, and 29 (76.32%) were common COVID-19. Among them, family clustering infection accounted for 50% (7/14) of child cases and 23.68% (9/36) of adult cases. Epidemiological exposure history, clinical classification, clinical symptoms, chest CT manifestations, and number of SARS-CoV-2-positive days were not significantly different between children and adults. However, the percentage of neutrophils in adults was significantly higher than that in children (P < 0.05). The percentage and absolute value of lymphocytes, platelet counts, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase in adults were lower than those in children (P < 0.05). Conclusively, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 show the characteristics of family clustering, and the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections is higher. For families with a history of epidemiological exposure, routine SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and chest CT examination should be performed in asymptomatic children to determine whether they are infected. Unlike adults, although the reduction of lymphocytes and platelets in children is not common, it is necessary to be alert to the increased risk of liver damage in children.

0	Covid-19 susceptibility and severity might be modified by vitamin d status: Theoretical and practical considerations. Background: The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has resulted in the Covid-19 pandemic with severe morbidity and high mortality, particularly in certain sections of the population. The co-morbidity patterns associated with adverse outcomes are multiple and complex and there is emerging epidemiological, nutritional and molecular biological evidence that an inadequate vitamin D status is a contributing factor. Objective(s): The aim was to review the role of vitamin D in immune function with particular reference to the mechanisms whereby it supports immune efficiency, host protection and immune modulation. The evidence for the possible benefit of vitamin D supplementation to ameliorate the severity of respiratory infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens was also reviewed with a view to making a recommendation. Method(s): PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar were searched using the terms: Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, vitamin D, calcitriol, deficiency, adaptive immunity, innate immunity, ventilation, critical care, intensive care, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, respiratory viruses, respiratory tract infection, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, supplementation. Papers for inclusion were selected on the basis of relevance and quality. Finding(s): Vitamin D insufficiency is widespread in many parts of the world. Vitamin D is needed for normal protective and surveillance immune function and there is evidence that deficiency increases the risk of some respiratory infections, probably including Covid-19. By binding with dedicated receptors on immune cells vitamin D influences several strands of immune function, including the production of anti-microbial peptides and several cytokines that promote an appropriate immune response. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the risk of respiratory infection, with persuasive biological, epidemiological and observational evidence for possible benefit against Covid-19. Conclusion(s): Despite the lack of direct evidence specific to Covid-19 a cogent theoretical case can be made for giving adults from selected groups, and arguably all adults, routine supplementation with vitamin D to improve immune efficiency and reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory infections. This could be particularly important in sections of the population with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Targeted research is required to provide firm evidence to guide practice.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.	false
0	"Virtual reality behavioral activation as an intervention for major depressive disorder: Case report. Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one's ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 ""shelter-in-place"" and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective(s): The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Method(s): The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Result(s): The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant's depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). Conclusion(s): The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.Copyright © Margot Paul, Kim Bullock, Jeremy Bailenson.

0	Does nosocomial COVID-19 result in increased 30-day mortality? A multi-centre observational study to identify risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to determine whether nosocomial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a worse outcome compared with community-acquired COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals on 9th April 2020. Patients were followed-up for at least 30 days. Nosocomial infection was defined as a positive swab after 7 days of admission. In total, one hundred and seventy-three patients were identified, and 19 (11.0%) had nosocomial infection. Thirty-two (18.5%) patients died within 30 days (all cause) of a positive swab test; there were no significant differences in 30-day all-cause mortality rates between the three groups (i.e. patients admitted with suspected COVID-19, patients with incidental COVID-19 and patients with nosocomial COVID-19): 21.1% vs 17.6% vs 21.6% (P=0.755). Nosocomial COVID-19 is not associated with increased mortality compared with community-acquired COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	TRATAMENTO DE COVID-19 COM PLASMA CONVALESCENTE: RELATO DE CASO. Introducao: A COVID-19 e uma doenca causada pelo SARS-CoV-2 e teve seu primeiro caso relatado em dez/2019 na China. (DUAN, 2020) Essa doenca aumentou significativamente as hospitalizacoes e obitos por pneumonia e ainda nao estao disponiveis agentes terapeuticos especificos ou vacinas com eficacia comprovada (WIERSINGA, 2020; SHEN, 2020). O plasma convalescente vem sendo estudado como estrategia terapeutica e consiste em transferir anticorpos do plasma de um doador recuperado da doenca, sendo considerado um metodo de imunizacao passiva. Segundo a FDA, Agencia Reguladora dos EUA, essa terapeutica pode ser solicitada, em carater emergencial, para pacientes graves e criticos (FDA, 2020). No Brasil, a ANVISA reforca que seu uso seja monitorizado por um estudo clinico ou observacional. Caso: Paciente sexo masculino, 31 anos, profissional da area da saude, relata exposicao a possivel fonte de contaminacao no dia 20/06/2020. Refere que a data de inicio de sua sintomatologia ocorreu no dia 23/06/2020 (D1) e consistia em odinofagia, seguido de febre alta e astenia. E portador de diabetes mellitus, hipertensao e dislipidemia, todos sob controle com medicacao. Procurou o servico de emergencia, com queda da saturacao de oxigenio e taquipneia no dia 02/07/2020 (D9) e foi admitido na UTI, com necessidade de VNI (ventilacao nao invasiva). A tomografia de torax mostrou comprometimento pulmonar em 30-50% do parenquima pulmonar e nao apresentava alteracoes de funcao renal, nem sinais de sepse, CIVD ou insuficiencia de multiplos orgaos. Estava em uso de ceftriaxona, cefepime, metilprednisolona, anticoagulante em dose intermediaria (0,5 mg/kg 12/12h) e, recebeu terapia com plasma convalescente (03/07/2020, D10). O paciente e do tipo sanguineo A positivo. As duas bolsas transfundidas foram obtidas do mesmo doador, um homem de 55 anos, com quantificacao de IgM de 3,7 UA/mL e IgG: 82,1 UA/mL (metodologia CLIA - quimioluminescencia). Paciente relata que um dia apos receber o plasma, ja apresentava melhora importante dos sintomas, e recebeu alta hospitalar no dia 07/07/2020 (D14), assintomatico. Refere nao ter apresentado efeitos adversos a terapia. Discussao: O uso do plasma convalescente e uma das opcoes terapeuticas na COVID-19 em pacientes graves ou criticos. Mais de 5 mil pacientes ja foram tratados nos EUA e o tratamento parece ser seguro (JOYNER, 2020). Um estudo inicial com 5 pacientes (doenca critica) demonstrou melhora clinica, com diminuicao da temperatura corporal, melhora dos exames de imagem e aumento da relacao PaO2/FiO2 (SHEN, 2020). No entanto, Li e colaboradores analisaram 103 pacientes e nao conseguiram demonstrar melhora clinica estatisticamente significativa dentro de 28 dias de seguimento, provavelmente devido ao numero pequeno de pacientes em cada braco (LI, 2020). Neste estudo, quando se analisou apenas pacientes que receberam o plasma antes da necessidade de ventilacao mecanica, notou-se uma tendencia estatistica de beneficio da terapia. Neste relato, descrevemos um caso de sucesso no uso do plasma convalescente em paciente jovem, com comorbidades, e sinais de doenca grave, que recebeu a terapia de forma precoce. Conclusao: Tendo em vista o cenario pandemico da atualidade, o uso da terapia de plasma convalescente vem sendo realizado em diversos paises, inclusive no Brasil, ainda em carater experimental, como uma alternativa para pacientes com doenca considerada grave ou critica.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Covid-19 pneumonia with delayed viral clearance in a patient with active drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. COVID pneumonia patient presents with fever, cough, and breathing difficulty. Many respiratory pathogens have such clinical presentations and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is one of them, which is prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. Herein, we are presenting a case of dual infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and drug-resistant PTB [likely multidrug resistance (MDR)] in a patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, a clinical course further complicated by a prolonged viral clearance.Copyright © The Author(s). 2020.	false
0	Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients at the Time of Hospital Admission for COVID-19. Background: Infection with SARS-CoV- 2 is responsible for systemic coagulation activation and thromboembolic events are reported as common during hospitalisation. However, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on hospital admission for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. PE suspicion is challenging on admission, especially if patients have high levels of D-Dimers. Aim(s): The main objective of the study was to establish the PE prevalence on hospital admission for patients with COVID-19. Method(s): This prospective multicentre study analysed consecutive adult patients on hospital admission for proven COVID-19 between April 15th and May 23rd 2020. If not contraindicated, patients were systematically screened with a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Clinical characteristics, biological samples, and YEARS items for PE suspicion were collected. Data are presented as median [min-max] for quantitative variables and as the number (percentage) for categorical variables. Result(s): 135 consecutive patients were admitted at hospital for confirmed COVID-19, of whom 107 (79.2%) underwent CTPA. Among them, PE was diagnosed in 16 patients (prevalence 15%, CI95% 8.8 -23.1) (Table 1). Patients with PE, compared to patients without PE, were significantly older, had significantly higher D-dimer concentrations and had more frequently risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Median time from symptoms to hospital admission was not different between the 2 groups (Table 1). Only 18/107 patients (16.8%) had >= 1 YEARS items. Application of the YEARS diagnostic algorithm would have avoided 37 (34%; CI95% 25-44%) CTPA but at a cost of one patient with PE (3.2%). Data of the prospective follow- up of patients will be available at the time of presentation. Conclusion(s): Despite a low level of clinical suspicion of PE, this prospective study demonstrated a high prevalence of PE at the time of hospital admission for COVID-19. Therefore, a systematic CTPA, instead of non-contrast chest CT, may be useful in this population.	false
0	Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Vaccines. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has become pandemic and the duration of protective immunity to the virus is unknown. Cases of persons reinfected with the virus are being reported with increasing frequency. At present it is unclear how common reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is and how long serum antibodies and virus-specific T cells persist after infection. For many other respiratory virus infections, including influenza and the seasonal coronaviruses that cause colds, serum antibodies persist for only months to a few years and reinfections are very common. Here we review what is known about the duration of immunity and reinfection with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and well as the duration of immunity to other viruses and virus vaccines. These findings have implications for the need of continued protective measures and for vaccines for persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

0	SEVERE COVID19 IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER: ANALYSIS OF MORTALITY, ADMISSION TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND INVASIVE VENTILATION. Introduction: Currently, we are facing a global pandemic COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Since the first reported Brazilian case on February 26 to July 31 2020, Brazil has presented as the second country of the world with the highest number of cases and deaths: 2,662,485 and 92,475 respectively. Moreover, Sao Paulo presented the majority of Brazilian data with 542,304 cases with 22,997 deaths. We know that hematological disease are not prevalent, it is concerned to report that 1.9% of death in Sao Paulo presented this group of disease, according to SIVEP-Flu. Although, we understand that age and co-exisiting comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease are high risk factors to mortality, it was demonstrated that patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 with hematological disease have presented 28-40% of deaths. Objective(s): We proposed to describe the demographic characteristics by comparing hypothetical risk factors to death, such as, age, gender, Hemato-oncology patient (HOP) versus cancer patients with Non-Hemato-Oncology cancer (NHOP) and anti-cancer therapy within 21 days before testing positive for COVID-19 in patients needed hospitalization. Method(s): In this prospective observational study, On March 30 2020, we started to register all consecutive cancer patients undergoing treatment or being followed up by the Instituto Hemomed which were confirmed COVID-19 by reverse-transcriptase-polyerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab between March 30 and July 31, 2020. Inclusion criteria: cancer patients, positive RT-PCR and need of hospitalization due to severe COVID-19. We excluded all patient who did not require hospitalization and patients with active case of COVID-19. Death was defined as related COVID-19 during admission as well as death reported as a consequence of any other cause during admission, such as due to cancer progression or treatment toxicity. Result(s): Sixty-one cases were registered until July 31, 2020, two cases were excluded with active COVID-19 and eight patients with outpatient treatment. We analyzed 51 severe COVID19 patient with cancer. Thirty-two (62.7%) sex female and median age 60 (+/- 17.6) years old, 31 (60.7%) HOP and 20 (39.1%) NHOP and 25(49%) were treated with anti-cancer therapy up to 21 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty (58.8%) required Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 22 (43.1%) needed invasive ventilation and 26 (51%) discharged. Twenty-five (49%) patients died - four (7.8%) of them were considered palliative care. Risk of death was age >= 60 years old (odds ratio 4.8 [95% CI 1.47-15.0, p = 0.008]), and anti-cancer therapy up to 21 days before COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio 3.4 [95% CI 1.07-10.7], p = 0.035). We found no significant effect on mortality for male (odds ratio 0.9 [95% CI 0.2-2.8, p = 0.54]) and NHOP (odds ratio 1.4 [95% CI 0.4-4.5, p = 0.34]). Conclusion(s): Severe COVID-19 deaths in cancer patients was 49%, more than a half of cases needed ICU and mortality appears to be related to advanced age and anti-cancer therapy up to 21 days before COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	MANUTENCAO DOS NIVEIS DE ANTICORPOS NEUTRALIZANTES (NAB) E DE LIGACAO PARA PROTEINAS DE NUCLEOCAPSIDEOS (NP) DE SARS-CoV-2 EM UNIDADES DE PLASMA DE DOADORES CONVALESCENTES (CCP) TRATADOS POR AMOTOSALEN/UVA (A/UVA). Objetivos: O plasma de doadores convalescentes ao COVID-19 (CCP) tem sido aplicado como terapia a casos graves desta doenca. A reducao de patogenos (PR) pode ser aplicada para mitigar o risco de doencas transmissiveis por transfusoes. Investigamos o impacto do tratamento de unidades de CCP tratadas com A/UVA quanto aos titulos de nAbs e anti-NP (IgM, IgG and IgA). Materiais e metodos: Unidades de CCP foram colhidas por plasmaferese (600 mL) a partir de uma coorte de doadores masculinos convalescentes ao COVID-19 (com forma leve ou moderada), previamente confirmados por teste RT-PCR positivo [+vo]; todos eram doadores de primeira vez, voluntarios, com > 14 dias apos total resolucao dos sintomas. As unidades CCP foram tratadas com o Sistema INTERCEPT (Cerus Corporation, Concord, EUA), de acordo com as recomendacoes do fabricante, seja individualmente, ou em pools de duas unidades de 600 mL cada. Apos o tratamento, as unidades foram divididas em doses de 200 mL. Amostras pre e pos tratmento foram armazenadas a 4degreeC por 3-5 dias ate a realizacao de testes para nAb (titulos), utilizando o testes de neutralizacao viral (CPE - GenBank: MT MT350282) e para anticorpos especificos IgM, IgG eIgA anti-NP (ELISA). Resultados: Foram tratadas 16 unidades individuais e 94 em pool (n =110 CCP doacoes), resultando em 330x200 mL doses terapeuticas. Nao se observou nenhuma diferenca estatistica na media e desvio padrao das unidades individuais antes ou apos tratamento nos titulos de nAb (440+/-597; mediana=320), ou nas absorbancias de IgM (0.3+/-0.4), IgG (2.9+/-1.1) ou IgA (0.4+/-0.2). Para os pools, os titulos de nAb da unidade 1, 2 e pos tratamento foram, respectivamente 563+/-648, 767+/-1550 e 531+/-640 (mediana=320), com absorbancias para IgM de 0.2+/-0.1, 0.2+/-0.2 e 0.2+/-0.2, IgG de 2.4+/-1.3, 2.3+/-1.1 e 2.3+/-1.2, e IgA de 0.5+/-0.7, 0.5+/-0.7 e 0.5+/-0.8. Todos os resultados apresentaram um valor de p>0.05 (teste de Wilcoxon). Conclusao: Anti-NP IgM, IgG, IgA e nAbs nao sofreram impacto adverso pelo tratamento A/UVA, sugerindo que esta tecnologia de PR pode ser utilizada para mitigar o risco de infeccoes transmitidas por transfusoes em unidades CCP, que sao, geralmente, provenientes de doadores de primeira vez. Alem disto, a maioria destas unidades destina-se a pacientes idosos, imunossuprimidos ou com varias comorbidades. Portanto, o uso de tratamento A/UVA PR e nao apenas seguro como recomendado, pois preserva os mesmos niveis de anticorpos anti-SARS-CoV-2 em unidades CCP.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Can the detection dog alert on COVID-19 positive persons by sniffing axillary sweat samples? A proof-of-concept study. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate if trained dogs could discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 positive individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. The study was conducted at 2 sites (Paris, France, and Beirut, Lebanon), followed the same training and testing protocols, and involved six detection dogs (three explosive detection dogs, one search and rescue dog, and two colon cancer detection dogs). A total of 177 individuals were recruited for the study (95 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 82 asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals) from five hospitals, and one underarm sweat sample per individual was collected. The dog training sessions lasted between one and three weeks. Once trained, the dog had to mark the COVID-19 positive sample randomly placed behind one of three or four olfactory cones (the other cones contained at least one COVID-19 negative sample and between zero and two mocks). During the testing session, a COVID-19 positive sample could be used up to a maximum of three times for one dog. The dog and its handler were both blinded to the COVID-positive sample location. The success rate per dog (i.e., the number of correct indications divided by the number of trials) ranged from 76% to 100%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated success rate was most of the time higher than the success rate obtained by chance after removing the number of mocks from calculations. These results provide some evidence that detection dogs may be able to discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. However, due to the limitations of this proof-of-concept study (including using some COVID-19 samples more than once and potential confounding biases), these results must be confirmed in validation studies.	false
0	[Cutaneous Manifestations Associated with COVID-19: A Narrative Review]. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that has spread rapidly throughout the world. This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection., DISCUSSION: Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data., CONCLUSION: The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.	false
0	Levamisole - A Toxic Adulterant in Illicit Drug Preparations: A Review. Discovered in the 1960s, the common anthelminthic levamisole has seen widespread use in veterinary applications. Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Due to reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the US and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least two known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses. It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue. Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen options. Because of its varying presence in illicit drug markets, both the medical and forensic communities need to be aware of levamisole and its potential impact on toxicological investigations.	false
0	Challenges and opportunities for antiviral monoclonal antibodies as COVID-19 therapy. To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics. However, numerous historical efforts to advance antiviral mAbs for the treatment of other respiratory infections have been met with categorical failures in the clinic. By investigating the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses spread within the lung, along with available biodistribution data for systemically injected mAb, we highlight the challenges faced by current antiviral mAbs for COVID-19. We summarize some of the leading mAbs currently in development, and present the evidence supporting inhaled delivery of antiviral mAb as early intervention against COVID-19 that could prevent important pulmonary morbidities associated with the infection.

BACKGROUND: The large number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into fear in recent times. In Japan, 18,769 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have been reported as of June 30, 2020. This study aimed to assess whether cluster infection prevention is possible by evaluating the association between viral transmission and meteorological factors., METHODS: This study included 1,263 people who were successively diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hokkaido, Japan between January 24, 2020 and June 30, 2020. After obtaining the values from the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the average scores of air temperature and humidity were calculated and compared with COVID-19 reproduction numbers, and the association between COVID-19 incidence or reproduction number and meteorological factors was assessed., RESULTS: The COVID-19 reproduction number in Hokkaido had three peaks that came several days before the surge in COVID-19 cases. The peaks are indicative of cluster infections. There was a strong negative correlation between the kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the reproduction number., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Analysis of the reproduction number is important for predicting or suppressing COVID-19 infection clusters. The authors found a strong association between meteorological factors, such as kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Meteorological forecasts could provide foreknowledge about COVID-19 infection clusters in the future. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false

We addressed the impact of prior metformin use on prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19., METHODS: CORONADO is a nationwide observational study that included patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 between March 10 and April 10, 2020 in 68 French centres. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days of admission. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was reported for death up to day 28. The association between metformin use and outcomes was then estimated in a logistic regression analysis after applying a propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting approach., RESULTS: Among the 2449 patients included, 1496 were metformin users and 953 were not. Compared with non-users, metformin users were younger with a lower prevalence of diabetic complications, but had more severe features of COVID-19 on admission. The primary endpoint occurred in 28.0% of metformin users (vs 29.0% in non-users, P = 0.6134) on day 7 and in 32.6% (vs 38.7%, P = 0.0023) on day 28. The mortality rate was lower in metformin users on day 7 (8.2 vs 16.1%, P < 0.0001) and on day 28 (16.0 vs 28.6%, P < 0.0001). After propensity score weighting was applied, the odds ratios for primary outcome and death (OR [95%CI], metformin users vs non-users) were 0.838 [0.649-1.082] and 0.688 [0.470-1.007] on day 7, then 0.783 [0.615-0.996] and 0.710 [0.537-0.938] on day 28, respectively., CONCLUSION: Metformin use appeared to be associated with a lower risk of death in patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19.

0	Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches to Novel COVID-19 in Intensive Care Unit: A Narrative Review. This study aimed to compile the up-to-date information about the methods and pharmacological agents used in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and examine the methods used in the treatment of COVID-19 in patients in the intensive care unit by reviewing the treatment guidelines published by national health authorities worldwide. We surveyed the literature published on the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2]) before April 25, 2020, in PubMed. The results of the study identified serological and molecular methods (e.g., real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) used by physicians for diagnosing COVID-19 and identified thorax computed tomography along with other imaging methods used for determining the severity of the disease. However, it was concluded that the desired developments for treatment and vaccination have not been achieved till today, and many of the agents used and studied for the treatment were drugs previously used for the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome and SARS. COVID-19 has higher levels of transmissibility and pandemic risk. The available information revealed that, given the size and scope of the pandemic, to date, there has been no scientifically proven effective medicine and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. There is also an urgent need for further research for finding an effective medicine and vaccine for COVID-19 to prevent the occurrence of an outbreak in future and manage such public health emergency of this magnitude in both short and long terms. © Copyright 2020 by Turkish Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Society.	false
0	Lipid Profile Features and Their Associations With Disease Severity and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19. Background: Emerging studies have described and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of COVID-19 patients. Yet, scarce information is available regarding the association of lipid profile features and disease severity and mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study to investigate lipid profile features in patients with COVID-19. From 9 February to 4 April 2020, a total of 99 patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Dynamic alterations in lipid profiles were recorded and tracked. Outcomes were followed up until 4 April 2020. Results: We found that high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) levels were significantly lower in the severe disease group, with mortality cases showing the lowest levels (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, HDL-C and apoA-1 levels were independently associated with disease severity (apoA-1: odds ratio (OR): 0.651, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.456-0.929, p = 0.018; HDL-C: OR: 0.643, 95% CI: 0.456-0.906, p = 0.012). For predicting disease severity, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of HDL-C and apoA-1 levels at admission were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91), respectively. For in-hospital deaths, HDL-C and apoA-1 levels demonstrated similar discrimination ability, with AUCs of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88) and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88), respectively. Moreover, patients with lower serum concentrations of apoA-1 (<0.95 g/L) or HDL-C (<0.84 mmol/l) had higher mortality rates during hospitalization (log-rank p < 0.001). Notably, levels of apoA-1 and HDL-C were inversely proportional to disease severity. The survivors of severe cases showed significant recovery of apoA-1 levels at the end of hospitalization (vs. midterm apoA-1 levels, p = 0.02), whereas the mortality cases demonstrated continuously lower apoA-1 levels throughout hospitalization. Correlation analysis revealed that apoA-1 and HDL-C levels were negatively correlated with both admission levels and highest concentrations of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Conclusions: Severely ill COVID-19 patients featured low HDL-C and apoA-1 levels, which were strongly correlated with inflammatory states. Thus, low apoA-1 and HDL-C levels may be promising predictors for severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients suffering from COVID-19.

0	The US Public Health Service House-to-House Canvass Survey of the Morbidity and Mortality of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. Between November 20, 1918, and March 12, 1919, the US Public Health Service carried out a vast population-based survey to assess the incidence rate and mortality of the influenza pandemic among 146 203 persons in 18 localities across the United States. The survey attempted to retrospectively assess all self-reported or diagnosed cases of influenza since August 1, 1918. It indicated that the cumulative incidence of symptomatic influenza over 6 months had been 29.4% (range = 15% in Louisville, KY, to 53.3% in San Antonio, TX). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.70%, and it ranged from 0.78% in San Antonio to 3.14% in New London, Connecticut. Localities with high cumulative incidence were not necessarily those with high CFR. Overall, assuming the survey missed asymptomatic cases, between August 1, 1918, and February 21, 1919, maybe more than 50% of the population was infected, and about 1% of the infected died. Eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has not yet launched a survey that would provide population-based estimates of incidence and CFRs analogous to those generated by the 1918 US Public Health Service house-to-house canvass survey of influenza.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a high degree of physical, psychological and social stress on health professionals, including postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies. This stress is associated with the intense fear of occupational exposure to the virus. These professionals are at risk of becoming physically and mentally ill not only due to the infection but also due to prolonged exposure to multidimensional stress and continued work overload., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms that indicate mental disorders and burnout syndrome, as well as to determine risk factors for burnout among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: This will be a prospective cohort study with parallel groups. Recruitment will take place from July to August/2020. The sample size will be of, at least, 1.144 participants. The research instruments that will be used are the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Two waves of data collection will occur: the first wave will included data related to sample characterization and psychosocial evaluation; the final wave will occur 12 weeks later and will include an evaluation of the incidence of burnout as well as correlations with the potential predictive factors collected in the first wave. Additionally, data regarding work withdrawal will be collected., RESULTS: The project has data collection in progress. Recruitment started on July 29, 2020. Analysis of the results will begin after the initial inclusion of all participants., CONCLUSIONS: By evaluating the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of mental disorders and burnout among postgraduate students of medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil, we aim to understand the impact of dealing with this pandemic and contribute to planning measures that can alleviate this problem., CLINICALTRIAL: The study is registered in the Research Ethics Committee from the Medical School (CEP/FM) of the University of Brasilia (CAAE: 33493920.0.0000.5558)., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT: DERR1-10.2196/24298.	false
0	A Surge in Pediatric Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases: The Experience of Texas Children's Hospital from March to June 2020. BACKGROUND: An understanding of the clinical characteristics of children with coronavirus disease 2019 in diverse communities is needed to optimize the response of healthcare providers during this pandemic., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all children presenting to the Texas Children's Hospital system with testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 10, 2020 through June 28, 2020.Demographics were recorded for all patients undergoing testing and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded for children with positive tests., RESULTS: Of 16,554 unique patients <= 21 years of age who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 1215 (7.3%) patients tested positive. Infants under 1 year of age and patients aged 18-21 years had the highest percent of positive tests at 9.9% (230/2329) and 10.7% (79/739), respectively. Hispanic children accounted for 66% (802/1215) of positive tests, though they only represented 42.1% (6972/16554) of all children tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 1215 children with a positive test, 55.7% had fever, 40.9% had cough, 39.8% had congestion or rhinorrhea, 21.9% had gastrointestinal complaints, and 15.9% were asymptomatic. Only 97 (8%) patients were hospitalized (of which 68% were Hispanic). Most hospitalized patients had underlying medical conditions (62/97, 63.9%), including obesity. Thirty-one hospitalized patients (31/97, 32%) required respiratory support and nine patients (9/97, 9.3%) received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Two patients died., CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high percentage of Hispanic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalized. Most children with detection of SARS-CoV-2 had uncomplicated illness courses, some children were critically ill, and two patients died. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Effect of internationally imported cases on internal spread of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study. BACKGROUND: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions., METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates., FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions., INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, European Commission, National Institute for Health Research, Medical Research Council, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

BACKGROUND: On February 21, 2020, 2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in pilgrim travelers from Korea to Israel were identified. We investigated the source of infection, clinical features of COVID-19, and transmission potential of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases., METHODS: All 39 pilgrim travelers were aggressively tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Their clinical features and possible source of infection were investigated by interview and review of their medical records. Ten confirmed cases without symptoms at the first sampling dates were selected for follow-up reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests., RESULTS: Of 39 pilgrim travelers, 30 (77%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 positive COVID-19 cases, 4 (13%) were asymptomatic. Available follow-up cycle threshold values from 10 cases gradually increased over time and were lower during the presymptomatic period than during the postsymptomatic period. Out of 328 contacts related to the COVID-19 cases in the pilgrim travelers, 22 additional cases (7%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Three tertiary cases were identified to be transmitted by presymptomatic secondary cases., CONCLUSION: To prevent transmission of COVID-19, we need to focus on presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and massive testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required. More research about the possibility of presymptomatic transmission over 2 days before symptom onset is required. Copyright © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.	false
0	A case of COVID-19 reinfection in the UK. Protective immunity following COVID-19 infection is not yet fully understood. An understanding of COVID-19 reinfection will be key in guiding government and public health policy decisions in the coming months. This report describes two distinct infective episodes of COVID-19 occurring in the same individual, at the time of writing the first published case in the UK. In April 2020 a 25-year-old UK doctor exhibited classical COVID-19 symptoms, including fevers, headaches, and fatigue. A COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the time returned negative. However, a follow-up antibody test in May 2020 returned positive. In October 2020 the same individual exhibited coryzal symptoms and headaches. He was COVID-19 NAAT tested and found to be positive. There was exposure to high viral load prior to reinfection. Overall the second infection was symptomatically milder, with a faster recovery. This evidence for reinfection poses challenges for public health and vaccination efforts to protect against the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	The COVID-19 pandemic and dentistry: the clinical, legal and economic consequences - part 2: consequences of withholding dental care. As routine care was suspended in most countries, one could anticipate progression of undiagnosed and managed oral disease. Patients are usually unaware of the development of oral disease as it is not visible to them and largely asymptomatic, especially in its early stages. The natural progression of conditions such as caries and periodontitis is inevitable without diagnosis and management. The full extent of patient harm because of the suspension of routine dental care can only be estimated when routine oral examinations are fully re-established, and even then, we will probably never know the number of individuals impacted or the extent of disease progression and harm. In first-world countries, there has always been a back-up emergency treatment system for dental problems. For example, in the UK, the safety net for life-threatening swellings and for acute pain relief is the accident and emergency services. This system remained in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Courts could be expected to understand the coronavirus context and would take this into account should there be a complaint against the clinician about access to care. The suspension of routine dental care to save lives will lead to the closure of many dental practices due to substantial financial impact. The return to routine care will be slow, with prioritisation of non-aerosol generating procedures while we look to further understand methods to mitigate transmission risk via infected aerosol and spatter. Inevitably, the cost of personal protective equipment and the lower volume of patients pose a continued threat to businesses.	false

0	Prognostic Impact of Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia in COVID-19 Pneumonia. A HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19) Registry Analysis. Dysnatremia is associated with increased mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. SARS-COV2 (Severe-acute-respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus-type 2) pneumonia can be fatal. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether admittance dysnatremia is associated with mortality, sepsis, or intensive therapy (IT) in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia. This is a retrospective study of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry, with data collected from January 1th through April 31th, 2020. We selected all hospitalized adult patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-COV2 pneumonia and a registered admission serum sodium level (SNa). Patients were classified as hyponatremic (SNa <135 mmol/L), eunatremic (SNa 135-145 mmol/L), or hypernatremic (SNa >145 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate independent relationships of admission hyponatremia and hypernatremia, with mortality, sepsis, or IT during hospitalization. Four thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, median age 66 (52-77), 58% males. Death occurred in 988 (21.2%) patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 551 (12%) and IT in 838 (18.4%). Hyponatremia was present in 957/4,664 (20.5%) patients, and hypernatremia in 174/4,664 (3.7%). Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia were associated with mortality and sepsis. Only hyponatremia was associated with IT. In conclusion, hyponatremia and hypernatremia at admission are factors independently associated with mortality and sepsis in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia., Clinical Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334291, NCT04334291.

0	Infectious Mononucleosis Presenting with Loss of Taste and Smell During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic?. A 53-year-old woman presented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with an 18-day history of pyrexia, myalgia, progressive dyspnoea and loss of taste and smell after a close contact had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In this period two swabs had been negative for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical examination was normal. During this admission a third SARS-CoV-2 swab was negative, and investigations showed mildly elevated inflammatory markers, mildly deranged liver function, atypical lymphocytes on a blood film and a normal chest x-ray. Her Epstein-Barr virus serology was positive and thus the diagnosis was infectious mononucleosis., LEARNING POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 is not the only virus to cause loss of taste/smell and so other differential diagnoses should be considered.Loss of taste/smell is a subjective symptom, and therefore caution should be exercised in the context of an upper respiratory tract infection.

0	Kidney injury in COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to affect millions of people around the globe. As data emerge, it is becoming more evident that extrapulmonary organ involvement, particularly the kidneys, highly influence mortality. The incidence of acute kidney injury has been estimated to be 30% in COVID-19 non-survivors. Current evidence suggests four broad mechanisms of renal injury: Hypovolaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome related, cytokine storm and direct viral invasion as seen on renal autopsy findings. We look to critically assess the epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of kidney injury in COVID-19. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

0	A Patient With Dengue Fever and COVID-19: Coinfection or Not?. Co-epidemics can create a burden on healthcare systems in the affected areas. The world, at present, is facing the pandemic of coronavirus disease. Nonetheless, many areas worldwide suffer from endemics that are not of less danger than the current pandemic. We presented a case of a patient diagnosed with dengue fever and was also found to have coronavirus through nasal swab, but immunoglobulin M and G were undetectable. Our case brings to notice the alarming probability of two co-epidemics happening simultaneously. However, through the presented case, our theory is that the dengue virus may cause a false-positive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

0	"Routine asymptomatic testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation analysis. Background: Airline travel has been significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission risk from importation. Routine viral testing strategies for COVID-19 may facilitate safe airline travel through reduction of individual and/or population-level risk, although the effectiveness and optimal design of these ""test-and-travel"" strategies remain unclear., Methods: We developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of airline travelers to evaluate the effectiveness of various testing strategies to reduce individual risk of infection and population-level risk of transmission. We evaluated five testing strategies in asymptomatic passengers: i) anterior nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within 3 days of departure; ii) PCR within 3 days of departure and PCR 5 days after arrival; iii) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection); iv) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR 5 days after arrival; and v) PCR within 3 days of arrival alone. The travel period was defined as three days prior to the day of travel and two weeks following the day of travel, and we assumed passengers followed guidance on mask wearing during this period. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period (population-level transmission risk); the secondary outcome was the proportion of infectious persons detected on the day of travel (individual-level risk of infection). Sensitivity analyses were conducted., Findings: Assuming a community SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 50 daily infections, we estimated that in a cohort of 100,000 airline travelers followed over the travel period, there would be a total of 2,796 (95% UI: 2,031, 4,336) infectious days with 229 (95% UI: 170, 336) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test (within 3 days prior to departure) reduced the number of infectious days by 35% (95% UI: 27, 42) and identified 88% (95% UI: 76, 94) of the actively infectious travelers on the day of flight; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 79% (95% UI: 71, 84). The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days by 32% (95% UI: 25, 39) and identified 87% (95% UI: 81, 92) of the actively infectious travelers; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 70% (95% UI: 65, 75). The post-travel PCR test alone (within 3 days of landing) reduced the number of infectious days by 42% (95% UI: 31, 51). The ratio of true positives to false positives varied with the incidence of infection. The overall study conclusions were robust in sensitivity analysis., Interpretation: Routine asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 prior to travel can be an effective strategy to reduce individual risk of COVID-19 infection during travel, although post-travel testing with abbreviated quarantine is likely needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when traveling from a high to low incidence setting."	false
0	COVID-19 and the Unfinished Agenda of VISION 2020. PURPOSE: To critically evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on global ophthalmology and VISION 2020., DESIGN: Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases., METHODS: We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020., RESULTS: Over two decades of VISION 2020 advocacy and program implementation have culminated in a universal reduction of combined age-standardized prevalence of moderate to severe vision impairment (MSVI) across all world regions since 1990. Between 1990-2017, low-income countries observed large reductions in the age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 persons of vitamin A deficiency (25 155 to 19 187), under-corrected refractive disorders (2 286 to 2 040), cataract (1 846 to 1 690), onchocerciasis (5 577 to 2 871), trachoma (506 to 159), and leprosy (36 to 26). Despite these reductions, crude projections suggest that over 700 million persons will experience MSVI or blindness by 2050, principally owing to our growing and ageing global population., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the many resounding successes of VISION 2020, the burden of global blindness and vision impairment is set to reach historic levels in the coming years. The impact of COVID-19, while yet to be fully determined, now threatens the hard-fought gains of global ophthalmology. The post-pandemic years will require renewed effort and focus on vision advocacy and expanding eye care services worldwide. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Activities of Serum Ferritin and Treatment Outcomes Among COVID-19 Patients Treated With Vitamin C and Dexamethasone: An Uncontrolled Single-Center Observational Study. Background The fatal outcomes by COVID-19 are accompanied by cytokine storm syndrome, and thereby it is reported that disease severity is dependent on the cytokine storm syndrome. This cytokine storm can be assessed by evaluating the serum ferritin levels. The objective of this study was to assess the activities of serum ferritin and treatment outcomes among COVID-19 patients who were treated with dexamethasone and vitamin C. Materials and methods A single-center, prospective, observational study was conducted among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from July 2020 to August 2020. The diagnosis was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the lungs. Serum ferritin levels were compared with the treatment outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who were treated with dexamethasone and vitamin C. Results A total of 50 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 41.70 years. The recovery rate (94%) was remarkably high and is a good sign of COVID 19 treatment with vitamin C and dexamethasone as key modalities. The mean serum ferritin levels among recovered and expired patients were 478.81 ng/ml and 1410 ng/ml, respectively. Conclusion The serum activities of ferritin were markedly increased in COVID-19 patients who could not survive as compared to the patients who finally recovered from the infection.

0	Increased kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio in the serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV2: an observational cohort study. Immune dysregulation is a hallmark of patients infected by SARS-CoV2 and the balance between immune reactivity and tolerance is a key determinant of all stages of infection, including the excessive inflammatory state causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and drives mechanisms of immune tolerance. We examined the state of activation of the KP by measuring the Kyn:Trp ratio in the serum of healthy subjects (n=239), and SARS-CoV2-negative (n=305) and -positive patients (n=89). Patients were recruited at the Emergency Room of St. Andrea Hospital (Rome, Italy). Kyn and Trp serum levels were assessed by HPLC/MS-MS. Compared to healthy controls, both SARS-CoV2-negative and -positive patients showed an increase in the Kyn:Trp ratio. The increase was larger in SARS-CoV2-positive patients, with a significant difference between SARS-CoV2-positive and -negative patients. In addition, the increase was more prominent in males, and positively correlated with age and severity of SARS-CoV2 infection, categorized as follows: 1 = no need for intensive care unit (ICU); 2 = < 3 weeks spent in ICU; 3 = > 3 weeks spent in ICU; and 4 = death. The highest Kyn:Trp values were found in SARS-CoV2-positive patients with severe lymphopenia. These findings suggest that the Kyn:Trp ratio reflects the level of inflammation associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, and, therefore, might represent a valuable biomarker for therapeutic intervention.

0	Management of STEMI during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned in 2020 to Prepare for 2021. As the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 continues to increase, there is an increasing possibility that patients with COVID-19 may present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With social distancing and restricted access to preventive healthcare and emergency services, the management of acute cardiac emergencies such as myocardial infarction has suffered collateral damage. Thus far, global trends suggest a decrease in STEMI activations with possible worse outcomes due to delayed presentation and management. In this review, we discuss the challenges to STEMI management in the COVID-19 era and provide potential solutions for adherence to evidence-based therapies as the pandemic progresses into the year 2021.

0	"TRANSFUSAO DE SANGUE E A PANDEMIA. Objetivos: O artigo tem como objetivo reunir os principais pontos que devem ser considerados sobre o cuidado na transfusao sanguinea durante a pandemia e, sobretudo, analisar o possivel risco de transmissao da doenca. Materiais e metodos: O presente trabalho trata-se de uma revisao de literatura acerca dos desafios no processo de transfusao de sangue em relacao ao COVID-19 e seus riscos. Foram utilizadas as bases de dados eletronicas Google Academico e PUBMED. A pesquisa abrange trabalhos publicados em 2020, utilizando como descritores: ""COVI-19""e ""Blood transfusion"". Resultados: Em um estudo 78% dos pacientes apresentaram RNA viral detectavel no plasma na primeira semana de sua doenca. Outro estudo, relatou 3 dias apos o inicio da febre, 79% dos pacientes apresentavam RNA detectavel e carga viral maxima foi por volta do dia 4 ou 5. Um relato de caso um paciente recebeu transfusao de um paciente que estava contaminado, porem assintomatico. Discussao: A pandemia do coronavirus impactou e superlotou sistemas de saude pelo mundo. Como consequencia, afastou muito doadores e deixou os estoques de sangue muito baixos. No entanto, pacientes com doencas hematologicas, por exemplo, continuam precisando de transfusoes frequentes e, por isso, e fundamental ter conhecimento sobre a possibilidade de contaminacao pelas transfusoes sanguineas. Inevitavelmente, os laboratorios de transfusao de sangue encontram-se com amostras contaminadas ou suspeitas de COVID-19 por conta da alta prevalencia da doenca e pouco acesso a testes. Alem dos achados que evidenciam a presenca de RNA viral plasmatico, os pesquisadores descobriram que os linfocitos tem uma concentracao muito maior de RNA do que o plasma, seja testado na fase aguda ou na fase convalescente. Esses achados forneceram evidencias de que os linfocitos podem ser um dos alvos da COVID-19 e com isso indicaram, portanto, o potencial risco de transmissao por produtos sanguineos com altas concentracoes de linfocitos doadores como a doacao de celulas-tronco do sangue periferico, medula ossea, concentrados de granulocitos. Por outro lado, no relato de caso um paciente portador de anemia aplasica que recebeu transfusao de um paciente contaminado pelo virus, mesmo fazendo uso de imunossupressores obteve resultado negativo no PCR realizado dois dias apos a transfusao. Levando em consideracao o longo periodo de incubacao desse virus, alto numeros de casos assintomaticos, pouca disponibilidade de testes e alta transmissibilidade, deve-se repensar o fornecimento, seguranca, administracao, analise e transfusao de todo sangue admitido. O virus mostrou-se suscetivel a inativacao por calor ou a desnaturacao em pH acido ou basico. No entanto, essas tecnicas podem comprometer a qualidade do sangue por danificar seus componentes e, portanto, essas medidas ainda nao sao recomendadas pelas principais instituicoes mundiais como a American Association of Blood Banks. Conclusao: Portanto, dada a patogenicidade e o possivel potencial de transmissao por transfusoes sanguineas do COVID-19, e critica a preocupacao das unidades de saude, hospitais e, principalmente, laboratorios de exposicao de seus materiais e cuidado com seus pacientes. Desse modo, a atencao e cuidado com essas amostras deve ser significativamente aumentada e torna-se indispensavel seguir todos os protocolos de seguranca para evitar contaminacao de plasmas sadios e, consequentemente, pacientes de transfusao saudaveis.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Production and use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 treatment, taking into account the experience in the Central Millitary Hospital Prague. One of the available treatment alternatives for COVID-19 is the administration of convalescent plasma (CP), blood plasma obtained from people who have undergone the disease. Administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. CP can also be used for production a specific immunoglobulin. Experience from previous epidemic infections, caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, shows that CP contains neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which are probably the main source of its therapeutic potential. However, other immune mechanisms cannot be ruled out, such as antibody-induced cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 spread during the first half of year 2020 in many countries worldwide and relatively common is also in the Czech Republic, where, at the end of August 2020, about 100 patients were treated with CP. The production and use of CP is governed by the national multidisciplinary guidelines from April 2020 and the recommended therapeutic dose are 2 TU RP (400-450 mL), resp. 4-6 mL/kg. CP is indicated mainly in severe cases of COVID-19, which require oxygen support, ideally within 2-3 days after diagnosis, but our and foreign experience shows a beneficial effect of CP even in moderately severe cases that do not need oxygen treatment.	false
0	Home Care as a safe alternative during the COVID-19 crisis. INTRODUCTION: There are several reports worldwide about the high mortality related to COVID-19 among residents of nursing homes. The worldwide concern about the safety of patients and professionals in these institutions is relevant. In Brasil, a large part of post-acute care and chronic patients is performed at home through Home Care (HC)., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in Home Care patients and the clinical outcomes of these patients; it also aims to assess the impact of the epidemic on the number of patients, new admissions, and hospitalizations., METHODS: A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period., RESULTS: There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%)., CONCLUSION: Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.	false
0	Development and external validation of a prognostic tool for COVID-19 critical disease. BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed significant constraints in critical care capacity. In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care., METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia., RESULTS: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21-88 years]; 64% [36/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31/87), hypertension (37%, 32/87), and diabetes (24%, 24/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions. If further validated on additional cohorts of patients, this model/clinical tool may provide useful prognostication of critical care needs.	false
0	Lessons Learned Comparing Immune System Alterations of Bacterial Sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 Sepsis. Background: Bacterial sepsis has been used as a prototype to understand the pathogenesis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, some management programs for critically ill COVID-19 patients are also based on experience with bacterial sepsis. However, some differences may exist between these two types of sepsis., Methods: This retrospective study investigated whether there are differences in the immune system status of these two types of sepsis. A total of 64 bacterial sepsis patients and 43 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sepsis were included in this study. Demographic data were obtained from medical records. Laboratory results within 24 h after the diagnosis of sepsis were provided by the clinical laboratory., Results: The results of blood routine (neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts), infection biomarkers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin levels), lymphocyte subset counts (total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts), and lymphocyte subset functions (the proportions of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated IFN-gamma positive cells in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) were similar in bacterial sepsis patients and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. Cytokine storm was milder, and immunoglobulin and complement protein levels were higher in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients., Conclusions: There are both similarities and differences in the immune system status of bacterial sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis. Our findings do not support blocking the cytokine storm or supplementing immunoglobulins in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis, at least in the early stages of the disease. Treatments for overactivation of the complement system and lymphocyte depletion may be worth exploring further. Copyright © 2020 Dong, Wang, Liu, Gao, Bai and Li.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Epitopes Are Recognized by a Public and Diverse Repertoire of Human T Cell Receptors. Understanding the hallmarks of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed antibody and T cell reactivity in convalescent COVID-19 patients and healthy donors sampled both prior to and during the pandemic. Healthy donors examined during the pandemic exhibited increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but no humoral response. Their probable exposure to the virus resulted in either asymptomatic infection without antibody secretion or activation of preexisting immunity. In convalescent patients, we observed a public and diverse T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T cell receptor (TCR) motifs with germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the spike protein were mediated by groups of homologous TCRs, some of them shared across multiple donors. Overall, our results demonstrate that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2, including the identified set of TCRs, can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying antiviral immunity.

0	A Review of the Current Status of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Australia-The Clinical Impact of Changing Population Demographics and Diagnostic Criteria on Prevalence. The current status of gestational diabetes mellitus in Australia reveals an almost quadrupling prevalence over the last decade. A narrative review of the current Australian literature reveals unique challenges faced by Australian maternity clinicians when addressing this substantial disease burden in our diverse population. Rising rates of maternal overweight and obesity, increasing maternal age and the diversity of ethnicity are key epidemiological impactors, overlaid by the 2015 changes in screening and diagnostic parameters. Our vast land mass and the remote location of many at risk women requires innovative and novel ideas for pathways to diagnose and effectively manage women with gestational diabetes mellitus. By modifying and modernizing models of care for women with gestational diabetes mellitus, we have the ability to address accessibility, resource management and our acute response to global events such as the COVID 19 pandemic. With continuing research, education and robust discourse, Australia is well placed to meet current and future challenges in the management of gestational diabetes mellitus.	false
0	Performance of the COVID-19 SEROSpeed IgM/IgG Rapid Test, an immunochromatographic assay for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multicenter European study. This study assessed the diagnostic performance of the new COVID-19 SEROSpeed IgM/IgG Rapid Test (BioSpeedia, spin-off of the Pasteur Institute of Paris) for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other commercial antibody assays through a large cross-European study. The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 pre-pandemic sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders). The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR and whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests. The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients. The specificity of the test (BioS) on pre-pandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% CI: 96.2-99.4). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI: 0.83-0.89), with good concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.62). Due in part to simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG for both S1 and N proteins, BioS exhibited the highest positive percent agreement >=11 days post symptom onset (PSO). In conclusion, the BioS IgM/IgG rapid test was highly specific and demonstrated higher positive percent agreement compared to all the ELISA/CLIA commercial tests considered in this study. Moreover, by detecting the presence of antibodies prior to 11 days PSO in 78.2% of the patients, the BioS test increased the efficiency of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the disease.

0	Dynamics of CD4 T Cell and Antibody Responses in COVID-19 Patients With Different Disease Severity. Disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from mild illness to severe respiratory disease and death. In this study, we determined the kinetics of viral loads, antibody responses (IgM, IgG, neutralization) and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells by quantifying these parameters in 435 serial respiratory and blood samples collected from a cohort of 29 COVID-19 patients with either moderate or severe disease during the whole period of hospitalization or until death. Remarkably, there was no significant difference in the kinetics and plateau levels of neutralizing antibodies among the groups with different disease severity. In contrast, the dynamics of specific CD4 T cell responses differed considerably, but all patients with moderate or severe disease developed robust SARS-CoV-2-specific responses. Of note, none of the patients had detectable cross-reactive CD4 T cells in the first week after symptom onset, which have been described in 20-50% of unexposed individuals. Our data thus provide novel insights into the kinetics of antibody and CD4 T cell responses as well as viral loads that are key to understanding the role of adaptive immunity in combating the virus during acute infection and provide leads for the timing of immune therapies for COVID-19.

0	Community Coronavirus Disease 2019 Activity Level and Nursing Home Staff Testing for Active Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Indiana. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) community activity level can accurately inform strategies for routine testing of facility staff for active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 59,930 nursing home staff tested for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indiana., MEASURES: Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000., RESULTS: The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval 0.601-0.696) and 0.649 (95% confidence interval 0.601-0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants, yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive. Similarly, licensed practical nurses were 1.4% of staff, but 4.7% of positive cases., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We failed to observe a meaningful threshold of community COVID-19 activity for the purpose of predicting nursing homes with any positive staff. Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in August 2020 sets the minimum frequency of routine testing for nursing home staff based on county positivity rates. Using the recommended 5% county positivity rate to require weekly testing may miss asymptomatic infections among nursing home staff. Further data on results of all-staff testing efforts, particularly with the implementation of new widespread strategies such as point-of-care testing, is needed to guide policy to protect high-risk nursing home residents and staff. If the goal is to identify all asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infected nursing home staff, comprehensive repeat testing may be needed regardless of community level activity.

0	Telehealth in pediatric rehabilitation medicine: A survey of clinician reported utilization and experience. PURPOSE: Telehealth services have been touted to improve access to specialty pediatric care. COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of telehealth across many medical specialties. The purpose of this study was to examine telehealth utilization and satisfaction among pediatric physiatrists., METHODS: Using Google Forms, a voluntary survey was created and administered to pediatric physiatrists. The survey collected information on practice setting, telehealth utilization, provider satisfaction, perceived satisfaction of patients and families, and the anticipated role of telehealth in pediatric rehabilitation going forward., RESULTS: Seventy-eight respondents completed the survey. There was a significant reported increase in telehealth utilization since COVID-19 from 14.5% to 97.4%. Eighty-two percent of participants reported feeling comfortable utilizing telehealth, 77% felt confident in the quality of the care provided, and 91% believed patients were satisfied with telehealth visits. Responses indicate that telehealth is expected to play a role in future pediatric physiatry and interest in telehealth continuing medical education is prevalent. Most pediatric physiatrists plan to continue or expand telehealth offerings after COVID-19., CONCLUSION: Telehealth adoption has been expedited by COVID-19. Physician interest in and satisfaction with telehealth is high. Patient and family perceptions, outcomes of care, and barriers to implementation limiting program expansion deserve further study.	false
0	Long COVID in the Faroe Islands - a longitudinal study among non-hospitalized patients. BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term recovery from COVID-19 disease, especially in non-hospitalized individuals. In this longitudinal study we present symptoms registered during the acute phase as well as long COVID, i.e. long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms, in patients from the Faroe Islands., METHODS: All consecutive patients with confirmed RT-PCR testing from April to June 2020 were invited to participate in this study for the assessment of long COVID. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported acute and persistent symptoms were assessed using a standardized detailed questionnaire administered at enrollment and at repeated phone interviews in the period 22 th April to Aug 16 th., RESULTS: Of the 180 participants (96.3% of the 187 eligible COVID-19 patients), 53.1% reported persistence of at least one symptom after a mean of 125 days after symptoms onset, 33.3% reported one or two symptoms and 19.4% three or more symptoms. At the last follow-up, 46.7% were asymptomatic compared with 4.4 % during the acute phase. The most prevalent persistent symptoms were fatigue, loss of smell and taste, and arthralgias., CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that it might take months for symptoms to resolve, even among non-hospitalized persons with mild illness course in the acute phase. Continued monitoring for long COVID is needed. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

0	Clinical characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kuwait. Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe and life-threatening. National-level registries found that children, generally, have less severe disease when compared with adults. However, most asymptomatically infected children will not present to hospital and may be missed. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, and to estimate the potential duration of viral shedding. A retrospective cohort study was performed in Jaber Alahmad Hospital (JAH) from February 29 to April 30, 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures, all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients from 1 month to 18 years old, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at JAH, and were included. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity was defined as having two consecutive negative PCR results from a respiratory specimen. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed. We found that 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%-75.3%) of 134 SARS-CoV-2-infected children were asymptomatic. Median PCR positivity was 15 days and did not vary with symptoms. Among patients who had laboratory investigations and chest imaging, symptomatic infection was associated with elevated C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, and radiographic pneumonia. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is very common in children. Among symptomatic patients, the disease seems to be mild. Children exhibit substantial duration of viral shedding, regardless of symptoms. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	High lipasemia is frequent in Covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. BACKGROUND: Covid-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease that can cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Besides the lungs it can also affect other organs like the heart or the liver. Whether there is a pancreatic manifestation as well is currently unclear., METHODS: and aims: We prospectively collected patient information of patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS in a registry (COvid Registry REChts der Isar intensive care Trial - CORRECT) and analyzed this patient cohort for signs of acute pancreatitis (e.g. lipase activity >3 times the upper limit)., RESULTS: 12/38 (31.6%) patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS had a serum lipase activity >180 U/l. Median lipase activity was 422 U/l (186-1127). No patient showed typical findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging studies. On hemodynamic monitoring no patient had signs of intravascular fluid demand regarding MAP, GEDVI and therapy with vasopressors. To avoid worsening respiratory function no treatment with crystalloids was initiated. Lipasemia was not explained by gastroenteritis or renal insufficiency, occurred before as well as after viral clearance and 16.1 +/- 6.0 days after the first symptoms. No patient developed severe acute pancreatitis during the follow up period of 35.8 +/- 8.3 days., CONCLUSION: High lipasemia without typical signs of acute pancreatitis is a frequent finding in severe Covid-19 associated ARDS. Considering the markedly high levels of serum lipase activity, we think impaired microcirculation in severely ill patients can explain this finding rather than extra-pancreatic co-morbidities (UTN: DRKS00021612).

0	COVID-19 Like Findings in a Fatal Case of Idiopathic Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia Associated With IgA Glomerulonephritis in a 13-Month-Old Child. In the COVID-19 era, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are suspected to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this paper is to present a case with COVID-like pneumonia, with fatal evolution. The clinical aspects were correlated with the autopsy findings and discussed on the background of the most recent data from the medical literature. A 13-month-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with acute severe shortness of breath and pulmonary bilateral ground-glass opacities and an almost complete opacified left lung. The patient suddenly deteriorated, and death was confirmed 3 h after admission. At autopsy, severe desquamative interstitial pneumonia was diagnosed and was associated with an unusual IgA glomerulonephritis. No SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the lung parenchyma by RT- PCR. This is a very unusual case of rapid deterioration of an infant with idiopathic desquamative interstitial pneumonia (IDP) and multiorgan involvement. Based on immunohistochemical stains, we hypothesize that, in IDP, the hyaline membranes arise from necrotizing desquamated pneumocytes. In the COVID-19 era, such cases are extremely difficult to diagnose; they can mimic SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injuries. This pattern of hyaline membrane formation might explain the poor response to oxygen therapy. The present case highlights the importance of autopsy in such challenging cases.

0	Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe Covid-19. Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HC) +/- azithromycin (AZ) is widely used for Covid-19. The Qatar Prospective RCT of Expediting Coronavirus Tapering (Q-PROTECT) aimed to assess virologic cure rates of HC+/-AZ in cases of low-acuity Covid-19. Method(s): Q-PROTECT employed a prospective, placebo-controlled design with blinded randomization to three parallel arms: placebo, oral HC (600 mg daily for one week), or oral HC plus oral AZ (500 mg day one, 250 mg daily on days two through five). At enrollment, non-hospitalized participants had mild or no symptoms and were within a day of Covid-19 positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After six days, intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the primary endpoint of virologic cure was assessed using binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and chi2 testing. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04349592, trial status closed to new participants.) Findings: The study enrolled 456 participants (152 in each of three groups: HC+AZ, HC, placebo) between 13 April and 1 August 2020. HC+AZ, HC, and placebo groups had 6 (3.9%), 7 (4.6%), and 9 (5.9%) participants go off study medications before completing the medication course (p = 0.716). Day six PCR results were available for all 152 HC+AZ participants, 149/152 (98.0%) HC participants, and 147/152 (96.7%) placebo participants. Day six ITT analysis found no difference (p = 0.821) in groups' proportions achieving virologic cure: HC+AZ 16/152 (10.5%), HC 19/149 (12.8%), placebo 18/147 (12.2%). Day 14 assessment also showed no association (p = 0.072) between study group and viral cure: HC+AZ 30/149 (20.1%,), HC 42/146 (28.8%), placebo 45/143 (31.5%). There were no serious adverse events. Interpretation(s): HC+/-AZ does not facilitate virologic cure in patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19. Funding(s): The study was supported by internal institutional funds of the Hamad Medical Corporation (government health service of the State of Qatar).Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

0	Is COVID-19 really a life threatening pandemic - a survey on popular perception. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and belong to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans, birds, bats, snakes, mice, and other wild animals. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of Saliva or discharges from the hose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, there is no specific vaccine way or treatment for COVID 19. A self-administered questionnaire was prepared to comprise about 13 questions based on the topic of the survey and circulated to about 100 people through an online google form. The questions were studied carefully and corresponding answers were marked by the participants. The data were collected and statistically analyzed. From the results, the majority of the study population gave positive responses that COVID-19 is really a life-threatening pandemic.100% of the population were aware of the pandemic, it's outbreaks in several countries and its devastating effects. This study gives an insight into popular perception of COVID-19 as a life-threatening pandemic and awareness on its spread and ways to control it.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

0	Distinguishing between typical Kawasaki disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2. In recent months, there are increasing reports of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), termed 'Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS)' in the UK. Debate is ongoing regarding the nature of these pro-inflammatory syndromes. We herein propose that the platelet count may, at least in part, be able to help us differentiate between the two aforementioned syndromes. In a recent report, compared to a historical 'classical' Kawasaki disease (KD) cohort, patients with PIMS-TS had significantly lower platelet counts (188 vs 383 g/L, p < 0.0001). A possible explanation for this is their difference in underlying immunopathogenesis. In KD, the fundamental pathogenesis is thought to be immune complex-mediated, hence, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) which competes with the immunoglobulin Fc receptors (FcRs) on inflammatory cells, preventing the activation of these cells and thereby ameliorating the inflammatory response. If left untreated, these immune complexes activates the inflammatory cells (including monocytes and neutrophils), which also results in recruitment of platelets, resulting in the thrombocytosis we commonly see in KD. These immune complexes may also bind to platelets directly via FcRs on platelet membranes. In contrast, in viral-associated hyperinflammatory syndromes (e.g. PIMS-TS or MIS-C), there are mediators being secreted in the process of eradication of the virus (mainly to stimulate CD8+ cells to kill viral infected cells), which would inadvertently suppress bone marrow function and activate platelets, culminating in thrombocytopenia.

0	Malnutrition in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rationale: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) are potentially at risk of malnutrition because of reduced food intake and catabolism-related inflammation, reduced mobility due to hospitalization, older age and comorbidities. The prevalence and the causes of malnutrition as well as the provided nutrition care were evaluated in all the COVID-19 adults hospitalized in a 3rd level hospital in Italy. Method(s): A one-day audit was carried out recording: age, measured or estimated body weight (BW) and height, BMI (Kg/m2), 30-day weight loss (WL), comorbidities, serum albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP; nv<0.5 mg/dL), hospital diet intake, oral nutrition supplements (ONS), enteral (EN) or parenteral nutrition (PN). The NRS-2000 tool and the GLIM criteria were used for the malnutrition risk screening and the diagnosis of malnutrition, respectively. Statistics: %, median, non-parametric tests. Result(s): A total of 268 patients (74 yrs, M 55%) were hospitalized in 4 COVID-19 settings: internal medicine (IM) 61%, subintensive care unit (SICU) 8%, intensive care unit (ICU) 17%, rehabilitation unit (RU) 14%: BMI: <18.5, 9% (higher in RU, p=0.008) and >=30, 13% (higher in ICU,p=0.011); WL>=5%, 52% (higher in ICU and RU,p<0.001); CRP >5: 36% (higher in ICU and lower in RU,p<0.001); NRS score >=3, 76% (greater in ICU and RU,p<0.001); GLIM malnutrition, 29% (higher in ICU and smaller in MI,p<0.001); hospital diet intake <=50%, 39% (higher in IM and ICU,p<0.001); ONS, EN and PN were prescribed to 6%, 12% and 13%, respectively. Energy and protein intake/kg BW (ideal BW in obese) were 25 (lower in ICU,p=0.037) and 1.2 g (p>0.05), respectively. Conclusion(s): Malnutrition risk was present in three-fourth of patients and malnutrition in about one-third. The frequency increased according to the severity of the COVID-19 clinical feature. A very low dietary intake and a very high inflammatory state were present in one-third. Most of the patients were on oral diet alone. Protein intake was appropriate, whereas energy intake was at the lower limit of the recommended amount. Disclosure of Interest: None declaredCopyright © 2020	false

0	The predictive and diagnostic accuracy of long Pentraxin-3 in COVID-19 Pneumonia. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate serum Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) levels in Sars-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) patients and to investigate whether PTX-3 predicts the disease prognosis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized due to symptomatic pneumonia between April 15 2020 and August 15 2020. The patients were divided into two groups as survived patients and non-survived patients. Both groups were compared according to demographic features, comorbid conditions and measurement of the PTX-3 and other laboratory parameters of the patients., RESULTS: Of 88 patients with COVID-19, 59 (67%) were discharged with complete cure and 29 (33%) resulted in death. 46 (52.3%) of the patients were men. PTX-3 median value [IQR] was 3.66 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in all patients, 3.3 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in survivors and 3.91 ng/mL (1.9-23.2) in non-survivors which was significantly higher (p= 0.045). As a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis the cut-off value of PTX-3 for predicting mortality in patients was 3.73 with 65% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC: 0.646, 95% CI: 0.525-0.767, P= 0.045). Also, we found significant cut-off values with respect to D-Dimer, D-Dimer/ PTX-3, high-sensitivity troponin, high-sensitivity troponin/ PTX-3, lymphocyte, PTX-3/ lymphocyte, procalcitonin, procalcitonin/ PTX-3, CRP, and CRP/ PTX-3 (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: In this study, as far as we know, for the first time, we have shown PTX-3 as the new mortality biomarker for COVID-19 disease.	false
0	Evaluation of Initial Chest CT Findings of COVID-19 Pneumonia in 117 Deceased Patients: a Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND: There is no study in the literature in which only chest CT findings of deceased cases obtained at admission were examined and the relationship between these findings and mortality was evaluated. Metod: In this retrospective study, a total of 117 deceased patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and undergone chest CT were enrolled. We evaluated initial chest CT findings and the relationship of each, its location, prevalence and frequency with mortality., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 73 +/-18 years, 71 of all patients were male and 46 were female. The predominant feature was pure GGO lesion (82.0%), and 59.8% of cases had pure consolidation. There was no cavitation, or architectural distorsion. Pericardial effusion was found in 9.4%, and pleural effusions were found in 15.3% of patients. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was only 11.9% in total., CONCLUSION: In deceased patients, on admission CTs, pure consolidation, pleural and pericardial effusion, mediastinal LAP were more common than ordinary cases. It was these findings that should also raise the concern when they were seen on chest CT, therefore, these radiologic features have the potential to represent prognostic imaging markers in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.	false
0	Small molecular fluorescence dyes for immuno cell analysis. Many diseases, including cancers, AIDS, diabetes, asthma, Parkinson's, and lymphoma, are associated with the immune cell responses of patients suffering from them. Identifying the underlying immune response in such diseases is critical to correctly diagnose their root cause and determine the correct medications to target that root cause for personal therapy and immunotherapy. This work focuses on small molecular CF dyes to conjugate with antibodies, such as CD4 and CD19, for their application in flow cytometry. The CF dyes enable the expansion of flow cytometry reagent panels to support high dimensional flow cytometry analysis of the resulting emissions of 30-40 fluorescent colors, a record in flow cytometry. The CF dyes can be used along with existing flow cytometry dyes to provide a quick, accurate, and cost-effective method for the diagnosis and immunology treatment of diseases such as minimal residual disease (MRD) after cancer therapy. The CF dyes will also be an effective tool for the clinical studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the related vaccine development. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	A summary of coronavirus disease 2019: What we should know?. The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shifted the concerns of public health officials worldwide. Several previous studies have reported clinical features, methods of diagnosis and therapy approaches to combat the disease. Unfortunately, another problem arose in recognizing and distinguishing asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients who have a high risk of spreading the virus, which led health authorities to develop innovative strategies in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19. Known fever, cough, and myalgia with fatigue headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea and sometimes vomiting are the clinical features for patients confirmed with COVID-19. To confirm suspected patients, computerized tomography scan is the recommended modality since it has higher sensitivity. Several traditional approaches including antiviral, convalescent plasma therapy and monoclonal antibodies have been applied to combat the virus. Additionally, the application of several policies such as social distancing, recommendations for wearing masks and telemedicine were adopted to break the chain of the pandemic. There is much to learn from the many rapid advances in knowledge about this disease and we encourage everyone to always abide by health protocols recommended by healthcare providers so that this pandemic can end soon.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Investigational drugs for the COVID 19 pandemic - A concise review. The present year saw the emergence of a pandemic Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID 19). The unpreparedness for the pandemic and lack of drugs/vaccine against this virus has led to a high mortality rate across the world. In the process, a number of drugs have been tried against the corona virus including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies like tocilizumab and sarilumab and antimalarial drugs like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. At the present time, none of these drugs have reported efficacy against the virus. Here we present a review of all these drugs, their proposed mechanism of action against the corona virus and their status in clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Here we describe two patients who developed restricted and painful passive and active mobility of the hips, shoulders and elbows after mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Conventional radiography showed extensive heterotopic ossifications. Retrospectively, alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated. It is likely that local and systemic factors contribute to the development of heterotopic ossifications. Early diagnosis is important to provide complementary non-pharmacological interventions (gentle passive mobilization) and medication (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin). If pain and limited joint mobility remain present, surgical removal of ectopic bone could be considered. Future trials are needed to systematically map the prevalence of heterotopic ossifications in COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, andto evaluate whether prophylactic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is of relevance.	false
0	Novel Molecular Evidence Related to COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially compromises their innate immune system. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the affected cell. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia-induced glycosylation of ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the binding of S protein to ACE2, enabling viral entry. Downregulation of ACE2 activity secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II and metabolites, eventually leads to poor outcomes. The altered binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the compromised innate immunity of patients with DM increase their susceptibility to COVID-19; COVID-19 induces pancreatic beta-cell injury and poor glycemic control, which further compromises the immune response and aggravates hyperglycemia and COVID-19 progression, forming a vicious cycle. Sequential cleavage of viral S protein by furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers viral entry to release the viral genome into the target cell. Hence, TMPRSS2 and furin are possible drug targets. As type 1 DM exhibits a Th1-driven autoimmune process, the relatively lower mortality of COVID-19 in type 1 DM compared to type 2 DM might be attributed to an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 immunity. The anti-inflammatory effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor may benefit patients with DM and COVID-19. The potential protective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), including reduction in lactate level, prevention of lowering of cytosolic pH and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may justify the provision of SGLT2i to patients with DM and mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. For patients with DM and COVID-19 who require hospitalization, insulin-based treatment is recommended with cessation of metformin and SGLT2i. Further evidence from randomized or case-control clinical trials is necessary to elucidate the effectiveness and pitfalls of different types of medication for DM.	false
0	"Characteristics of Nosocomial Infections in Children Screened for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in China. BACKGROUND This study summarizes the characteristics of children screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and reports the case of 1 child who was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center and the cases of his family members. MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 159 children who were admitted to our hospital from January 23 to March 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test. RESULTS Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. A 7-year-old boy in a cluster family from Wuhan was confirmed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with ground-glass opacity shadows on his lung computed tomography scan, and his swab RT-PCR test had not turned negative until day 19 of his hospitalization. In patients who did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were observed. A total of 158 patients recovered, were discharged, and experienced no abnormalities during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS For SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infections, taking a ""standard prevention & contact isolation & droplet isolation & air isolation"" strategy can prevent infection effectively. Children with clustered disease need close monitoring."	false
0	Computing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk From Symptoms, Imaging, and Test Data: Diagnostic Model Development. BACKGROUND: Assigning meaningful probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk presents a diagnostic challenge across the continuum of care., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and clinically validate an adaptable, personalized diagnostic model to assist clinicians in ruling in and ruling out COVID-19 in potential patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of probabilistic, graphical, and machine learning models against a previously published benchmark model., METHODS: We integrated patient symptoms and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on 13 symptoms and estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19-compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over the course of 14 days starting in March 2020., RESULTS: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (n=43, 78%) or cough (n=42, 77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11, 20%) or hospital care (n=44, 80%). In total, 51% (n=28) were female and 49% (n=27) were aged <60 years. Common comorbidities included diabetes (n=12, 22%), hypertension (n=15, 27%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and cardiovascular disease (n=7, 13%). Of these, 69% (n=38) were confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 20% (n=11) had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6%-84.2%, specificities of 58.8%-70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4%-71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices., CONCLUSIONS: Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in real-world settings.

0	Clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia was reported in Qatif on March 2nd, 2020. Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of the initial COVID-19 patients in that area., METHODS: This is an observational study describing the clinical presentation, radiographic and laboratory data of COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: From March 1st, 2020 to April 5th, 2020 we identified a total of 82 adult COVID-19 patients. The median age of the patients was 50 years, with a range of 30 to 60 years and most of patients were female 54 (65.9%). Of all the patients, 29 (35.4%) were contacts and 43 (52.4%) were returning travelers, mainly from Iraq (65% of the total returning travelers). Comorbidities were present in 50% of patients, G6PD deficiency in 33%, hypertension in 27%, and diabetes mellitus in 26%. Chest radiographs were abnormal in 46% of symptomatic and 15.5% of asymptomatic patients (P value = 0.0035). Of all patients, 4 (4.87%) required intensive care admission. There was no significant difference in time to negative RT-PCR with mean days to negativity of 13.6 and 16.9 for asymptomatic and symptomatic group, respectively (P value = 0.42)., CONCLUSIONS: In the initial Epicenter of the COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the majority of the patients were asymptomatic and were returning travelers. Comorbidities were present in nearly half of the patients. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Stroke as a Neurological Complication of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Incidence, Outcomes and Predictors. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a multi-system infection which predominantly affects the respiratory system, but also causes systemic inflammation, endothelialitis and thrombosis. The consequences of this include renal dysfunction, hepatitis and stroke. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of patients who suffer from stroke as a complication of COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of all studies published between November 1, 2019 and July 8, 2020 which reported on patients who suffered from stroke as a complication of COVID-19., RESULTS: 326 studies were screened, and 30 studies reporting findings from 55,176 patients including 899 with stroke were included. The average age of patients who suffered from stroke as a complication of COVID-19 was 65.5 (Range: 40.4-76.4 years). The average incidence of stroke as a complication of COVID-19 was 1.74% (95% CI: 1.09% to 2.51%). The average mortality of stroke in COVID-19 patients was 31.76% (95% CI: 17.77% to 47.31%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters including deranged coagulation profiles, liver function tests, and full blood counts., CONCLUSION: Although stroke is an uncommon complication of COVID-19, when present, it often results in significant morbidity and mortality. In COVID-19 patients, stroke was associated with older age, comorbidities, and severe illness. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	A Prospective Study of Voice, Swallow and Airway Outcomes following Tracheostomy for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demands on healthcare with many requiring intubation. Tracheostomy insertion has often been delayed and the enduring effects of this on voice, swallow and airway outcomes in COVID-19 tracheostomy patients are unknown. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess these outcomes in this patient cohort following hospital discharge., METHODS: All COVID-19 patients who had undergone tracheostomy insertion, and were subsequently decannulated, were identified at our institution and followed up two months post-discharge. Patient-reported (PROMS) and clinician-reported outcome measures, endoscopic examination and spirometry were used to assess voice, swallow and airway outcomes., RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study with a mean age of 56 years and male:female ratio of 28:13. Average duration of endotracheal intubation was 24 days and 63.4% of tracheostomies were performed at day 21-35 of intubation. 53.7% had an abnormal GRBAS score and 30% reported abnormal swallow on EAT-10 questionnaire. 81.1% had normal endoscopic examination of the larynx however positive endoscopic findings correlated with the patient self-reported VHI-10 (p=0.036) and EAT-10 scores (p=0.027). 22.5% had spirometric evidence of fixed upper airway obstruction using the Expiratory-Disproportion Index (EDI) and Spearman correlation analysis showed a positive trend between abnormal endoscopic findings and EDI scores over 50 (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study reveal a high incidence of laryngeal injury among patients who underwent intubation and tracheostomy insertion during the COVID-19 pandemic. As these patients continue to be followed up, the evolution of these complications will be studied. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Disordered eating behaviors in youths with type 1 diabetes during COVID-19 lockdown: an exploratory study. BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates that patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at higher risk for disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) than their peers without diabetes. The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of DEBs in a sample of Italian children and adolescents with T1D and in matched-pair healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown., METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 138 children and adolescents with T1D (aged 8.01-19.11 years, 65 boys) attending a Southern Italian diabetic service and 276 age- and gender-matched healthy peers voluntarily completed an online survey about eating behaviors (ChEAT and EAT-26), anthropometric characteristics, and clinical characteristics., RESULTS: 8.69% (N = 12) of participants with T1D and 13.4% (N = 37) of controls had ChEAT/EAT-26 scores indicating presence of DEBs, with no differences between patients-whether children (total ChEAT score F(1, 157) = .104, p = .748) or adolescents (total EAT-26 score F(1, 255) = .135, p = .731)-and healthy peers. zBMI values were lower than those measured in the latest diabetes visit (p < .0001), while HbA1c values remained unchanged (p = .110). In both groups, adolescents had lower Oral Control scores than children (T1D: F(1, 138) = 20.411, p < .0001, eta2 = .132, controls: F(1, 276) = 18.271, p < .0001, eta2 = .063); additionally, gender (female) and age were found to be significant predictors of several ChEAT/EAT-26 scores., CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggested that children and adolescents with T1D did not experience more DEB symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to healthy controls. Results revealed DEBs as more of a female adolescent developmental issue rather than a result of the challenges of living with a chronic illness under quarantine measures. Possible effects of parental pressure on their children's eating behaviors in the context of home confinement and of using a non-diabetes-specific measure to assess DEBs are discussed.	false
0	Nrf2-interacting nutrients and COVID-19: time for research to develop adaptation strategies. There are large between- and within-country variations in COVID-19 death rates. Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPARgamma:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NFkappaB: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2alpha:Elongation initiation factor 2alpha). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT1R axis (AT1R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1. Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity. It is therefore possible that the intake of these foods may restore an optimal natural balance for the Nrf2 pathway and may be of interest in the mitigation of COVID-19 severity.	false
0	[Experiences from the German COVID-19 register]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections represent a particular risk for several groups of patients with nephrological diseases. Patients on dialysis represent a particularly vulnerable group during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Initial data from international registries show a much higher mortality of dialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Because of the substantial differences between the healthcare systems, (state) preventive measures and treatment possibilities etc., in the different countries worldwide, local and national registry data cannot be easily transferred. In order to gain a reliable overview of the prevalence and mortality of dialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany, the German Society of Nephrology implemented a national registry for dialysis patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within this framework a standardized collection of these data is carried out on a weekly basis, which should enable a real-time overview of the case numbers and perhaps the acquisition of new scientific knowledge. Particularly in the current phase of the pandemic (autumn 2020), which is accompanied by a multiplication of the numbers of daily new-onset cases within only a few weeks, such data are highly relevant for the estimation and adjustment of the personnel, structural and organizational needs as well as the capacities for the treatment of patients.

0	[Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare Personnel in Cameroon]. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon., METHOD: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020., RESULT: The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers., DISCUSSION: The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	false
0	Diagnosis options in patients suffering from COVID-19- like symptoms. The role and performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic remains under active investigation. A recent case report in this journal found that a COVID-19 diagnosis has been made from the serological results despite first CT scan and RT-PCR negative results. We have included 311 consecutive patients with COVID-19-like symptoms who underwent a RT-PCR test on nasopharyngeal swab samples and a chest CT scan. Patients with a positive chest scan and a negative RT-PCR were screened for serum total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 2 months after the onset of symptoms using the Wantai test in order to arbitrate between RT-PCR and CT scans discordant results. Most of the RT-PCR and chest CT results agreed but the serological tests indicate that most CT positive/NAT negative patients are not infected by SARS-CoV-2 and alternative diagnoses should be seriously considered.

0	A case of area postrema variant of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a disabling autoimmune astrocytopathic channelopathy, characterized by the presence of pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channels. Several viral infections including HIV, influenza virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein Barr virus, among others, have been alleged to trigger NMOSD in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have been ever evolving and the spectrum of neuraxial involvement is broadening. Albeit it may affect any area of the neural axis, the involvement of the spinal cord is rare compared to that of the brain and of the peripheral nervous system. Cases with acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) have been recently reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection but did not fulfill the international consensus diagnostic criteria for NMOSD. AQP-4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD following SARS-CoV-2 infection had not yet been reported. We herein report a novel case of a previously healthy man who presented with a clinical picture of bouts of vomiting and hiccoughs (area postrema syndrome), which rapidly evolved to acute LETM, all following SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was finally diagnosed to be a case of seropositive NMOSD which presented as area postrema syndrome. The response to immunomodulatory drugs was excellent. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Effect of age, comorbidity and remission status on outcome of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies. BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of data on outcome of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies. Primary objective of study was to analyse the 14-day and 28-day mortality. Secondary objectives were to correlate age, comorbidities and remission status with outcome., METHODS: Retrospective multicentre observational study conducted in 11 centres across India. Total 130 patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 were enrolled., RESULTS: Fever and cough were commonest presentation. Eleven percent patients were incidentally detected. Median age of our cohort was 49.5 years. Most of our patients had a lymphoid malignancy (n = 91). One-half patients (52%) had mild infection, while moderate and severe infections contributed to one-fourth each. Sixty seven patients (52%) needed oxygen For treatment of COVID-19 infection, half(n = 66) received antivirals. Median time to RT-PCR COVID-19 negativity was 17 days (7-49 days). Nearly three-fourth (n = 95) of our patients were on anticancer treatment at time of infection, of which nearly two-third (n = 59;64%) had a delay in chemotherapy. Overall, 20% (n = 26) patients succumbed. 14-day survival and 28-day survival for whole cohort was 85.4% and 80%, respectively. One patient succumbed outside the study period on day 39. Importantly, death rate at 1 month was 50% and 60% in relapse/refractory and severe disease cohorts, respectively. Elderly patients(age >= 60) (p = 0.009), and severe COVID-19 infection (p = 0.000) had a poor 14-day survival. The 28-day survival was significantly better for patients in remission (p = 0.04), non-severe infection (p = 0.00), and age < 60 years (p = 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with hematological malignancy and severe covid-19 have worst outcomes specially when disease is not in remission.

0	[Biosafety in andrology laboratories during the outbreak of COVID-19]. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in December 2019 and has been rapidly escalating throughout the world. Clinical findings show that the patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 can be a potential source of infection. Although respiratory droplets and close contact are considered to be the main routes of transmission, there is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment. The nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces, urine and so on, but whether it exists in the semen has not been confirmed. It is reported that the novel coronavirus may affect the testis that highly expresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and theoretically the semen is a possible carrier of the virus considering the fact that it is discharged from the same channel as the urine. Andrology laboratorians are exposed to most of the specimens above, including semen, and some open operations in the laboratory increase the risk of aerosol generation. Therefore, corresponding protective procedures are necessitated in andrology laboratories to reduce the risk of infection during the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the knowledge and experience available as regards the pandemic and the characteristics of the work in the andrology laboratory, we summarize some biosafety points for andrology laboratorians to attend to during the outbreak of COVID-19.	false
0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives. OBJECTIVES: Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic. The high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene R (AAZ, France) assay., METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset., RESULTS: Specificity was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.3 to 100). Sensitivity was 79.3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74.0 to 84.6) and 93.0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88.7 to 97.2) within 14 days after symptoms onset. 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours. Among those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, i.e. Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among those with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia; the lower respiratory tract was explored for 6 of these 8 patients, showing positive RT-PCR in 5 cases., CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of a commercially available serum N-antigen detection assay. It presents a robust specificity and sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptoms onset. This approach provides a valuable new option for COVID-19 diagnosis, only requiring a blood draw and easily scalable in all clinical laboratories. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	COVID-19 Home Deaths without Medical Assistance in Northeastern Brazil. Since its beginning in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the disease caused by COVID-19 has reached more than 27 million confirmed cases and more than 880 thousand deaths worldwide by early September 2020. Although it is known that some of these deaths may have been influenced by the overload of health systems, the world medical literature lacks data on deaths due to COVID-19 in patients who have not received medical assistance. We conducted a retrospective transversal study to report the clinical and epidemiological profile of the first 200 consecutive cases of home deaths without medical assistance caused by COVID-19 diagnosed by verbal autopsy and real-time PCR in samples of postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs, in the state of Ceara, in Northeastern Brazil. The data show a slightly increased prevalence of cases in males (57%) and an average age of 76.8 years. Previous comorbidities were reported in 85.5% of cases, the most common being cardiovascular disease (45%), neurological disease (30%), and diabetes (29%). The main symptoms reported were dyspnea (79%), fever (75.5%), cough (69%), and fatigue (42.5%). The average time between the onset of illness and death was 7.3 days, being statistically shorter in patients who had previous comorbidities (P = 0.0215). This is the first study to evidence the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 home deaths without medical assistance, which may represent a considerable portion of the pandemic burden, especially in the context of health system overload.	false
0	Incidence of COVID-19 in patients under chronic treatment with hydroxychloroquine. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence of Covid-19 in patients who are chronic users of hydroxychloroquine., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective observational multicenter study in health areas and districts from Castilla La-Mancha and Andalucia. Of the 4451 participants included in the first recruitment, 3817 with valid data were selected. The main variable of the study is the presence or absence of Covid-19 infection by clinical, serological or polymerase chain reaction diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical variables and treatment and concomitant comorbidities were recorded., RESULTS: 169 (4,45%) patients had Covid-19 infection, of which 12 (7.1%) died and 32 (18.9%) required hospital admission. Previous respiratory pathology was related to Covid-19 infection (P<.05). Maculopathy appears in 5.3% of patients and is significantly related to the dose of hydroxychloroquine consumed (P<.05)., CONCLUSION: There is no relationship between chronic use of hydroxychloroquine and the incidence of Covid-19.

0	First Line of Defense in COVID-19: Masks in Clinical Practice. The current evidence suggests that masks are efficacious in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Although cloth masks are effective in outdoor environments, there is a consensus about the requirement of N95 masks or respirators when working in close proximity to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers, specifically in ophthalmology clinics, where slit-lamp examinations, noncontact tonometry, and other procedures place the physicians and patients in close proximity with each other. In this report, we review the available evidence regarding the efficacy of different types of masks in clinical practice in ophthalmology.	false
0	Reverse Zoonosis of COVID-19: Lessons From the 2009 Influenza Pandemic. Over the past decade, pandemics caused by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus in 2009 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 have emerged. Both are high-impact respiratory pathogens originating from animals. Their wide distribution in the human population subsequently results in an increased risk of human-to-animal transmission: reverse zoonosis. Although there have only been rare reports of reverse zoonosis events associated with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 so far, comparison with the pH1N1 influenza pandemic can provide a better understanding of the possible consequences of such events for public and animal health. The results of our review suggest that similar factors contribute to successful crossing of the host species barriers in both pandemics. Specific risk factors include sufficient interaction between infected humans and recipient animals, suitability of the animal host factors for productive virus infection, and suitability of the animal host population for viral persistence. Of particular concern is virus spread to susceptible animal species, in which group housing and contact network structure could potentially result in an alternative virus reservoir, from which reintroduction into humans can take place. Virus exposure in high-density populations could allow sustained transmission in susceptible animal species.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and intralabyrinthine hemorrhage in a patient with COVID-19., STUDY DESIGN: Clinical capsule report., SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center., PATIENT: An adult woman with bilateral SSNHL, aural fullness, and vertigo with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (IgG serology testing)., INTERVENTIONS: High-dose oral prednisone with taper, intratympanic dexamethasone., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Audiometric testing, MRI of the internal auditory canal with and without contrast., RESULTS: A patient presented with bilateral SSNHL, bilateral aural fullness, and vertigo. Serology testing performed several weeks after onset of symptoms was positive for IgG COVID-19 antibodies. MRI showed bilateral intralabyrinthine hemorrhage (left worse than right) and no tumor. The patient was treated with two courses of high-dose oral prednisone with taper and a left intratympanic dexamethasone injection, resulting in near-resolution of vestibular symptoms, a fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear, and a severe to profound mixed hearing loss in the left ear., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may have otologic manifestations including sudden SSNHL, aural fullness, vertigo, and intralabyrinthine hemorrhage.	false
0	Molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 clusters caused by asymptomatic cases in Anhui Province, China. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which spread globally in early 2020. Asymptomatic carriers of the virus contribute to the propagation of this disease, and the existence of asymptomatic infection has caused widespread fear and concern in the control of this pandemic., METHODS: In this study, we investigated the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 in Anhui's two clusters, analyzed the role and infectiousness of asymptomatic patients in disease transmission, and characterized the complete spike gene sequences in the Anhui strains., RESULTS: We conducted an epidemiological investigation of two clusters caused by asymptomatic infections sequenced the spike gene of viruses isolated from 12 patients. All cases of the two clusters we investigated had clear contact histories, both from Wuhan, Hubei province. The viruses isolated from two outbreaks in Anhui were found to show a genetically close link to the virus from Wuhan. In addition, new single nucleotide variations were discovered in the spike gene., CONCLUSIONS: Both clusters may have resulted from close contact and droplet-spreading and asymptomatic infections were identified as the initial cause. We also analyzed the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and the challenges to the current epidemic to provided information for the development of control strategies.	false

0	Biochemical and antigenic characterization of the structural proteins and their post-translational modifications in purified SARS-CoV-2 virions of an inactivated vaccine candidate. In the face of COVID-19 pandemic caused by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, an inactivated, Vero cell-based, whole virion vaccine candidate has been developed and entered into phase III clinical trials within six months. Biochemical and immunogenic characterization of structural proteins and their post-translational modifications in virions, the end-products of the vaccine candidate, would be essential for the quality control and process development of vaccine products and for studying the immunogenicity and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. By using a panel of rabbit antisera against virions and five structural proteins together with a convalescent serum, the spike (S) glycoprotein was shown to be N-linked glycosylated, PNGase F-sensitive, endoglycosidase H-resistant and cleaved by Furin-like proteases into S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S and S1/S2 subunits could form homodimers/trimers. The membrane (M) protein was partially N-linked glycosylated; the accessory protein 3a existed in three different forms, indicative of cleavage and dimerization. Furthermore, analysis of the antigenicity of these proteins and their post-translationally modified forms demonstrated that S protein induced the strongest antibody response in both convalescent and immunized animal sera. Interestingly, immunization with the inactivated vaccine did not elicit antibody response against the S2 subunit, whereas strong antibody response against both S1 and S2 subunits was detected in the convalescent serum. Moreover, vaccination stimulated stronger antibody response against S multimers than did the natural infection. This study revealed that the native S glycoprotein stimulated neutralizing antibodies, while bacterially-expressed S fragments did not. The study on S modifications would facilitate design of S-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.	false
0	Covid-19 and leptospirosis: Cytokine storm and the use of steroids. The majority of patients with Covid-19 have a good outcome. However, complications principally of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure can occur rapidly. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease, is similar to Covid-19 in that most infections are mild or asymptomatic and only a small number develop ARDS. Cytokine storm is considered to be the main incriminating factor in both. High dose steroids have been used to ameliorate the effects in leptospirosis, and similarly, reports suggest a benefit in Covid-19. SARS CoV-2 and leptospira, one a virus and the other a bacterium, are two species separated by millions of years of evolution, but producing illnesses with similar spectra, with cytokine storm being the common precipitating factor. As data are accrued from around the world, more light may be shed on features analogous to both pathways.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and virus-laden aerosol size distributions in outdoor air in north and south of Italy. The COVID-19 disease spread at different rates in the different countries and in different regions of the same country, as happened in Italy. Transmission by contact or at close range due to large respiratory droplets is widely accepted, however, the role of airborne transmission due to small respiratory droplets emitted by infected individuals (also asymptomatic) is controversial. It was suggested that outdoor airborne transmission could play a role in determining the differences observed in the spread rate. Concentrations of virus-laden aerosol are still poorly known and contrasting results are reported, especially for outdoor environments. Here we investigated outdoor concentrations and size distributions of virus-laden aerosol simultaneously collected during the pandemic, in May 2020, in northern (Veneto) and southern (Apulia) regions of Italy. The two regions exhibited significantly different prevalence of COVID-19. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (RNA) was determined, using both real time RT-PCR and ddPCR, in air samples collected using PM10 samplers and cascade impactors able to separate 12 size ranges from nanoparticles (diameter D < 0.056 microm) up to coarse particles (D > 18 microm). Air samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at both sites, viral particles concentrations were <0.8 copies m-3 in PM10 and <0.4 copies m-3 in each size range investigated. Outdoor air in residential and urban areas was generally not infectious and safe for the public in both northern and southern Italy, with the possible exclusion of very crowded sites. Therefore, it is likely that outdoor airborne transmission does not explain the difference in the spread of COVID-19 observed in the two Italian regions. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Comparison of Psychosocial Distress in Areas With Different COVID-19 Prevalence in Korea. Objectives: This study aimed to compare psychosocial distress in areas in Korea with different prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after validating a questionnaire on psychological experiences and stress associated with the disease outbreak. Methods: Using an online-based survey, psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19 was investigated in three regions, which were selected according to their prevalence of COVID-19. A total of 1,500 people from an online public panel in the three regions participated in the study. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information, psychosocial experience and stress related to COVID-19, and the perceived stress scale (PSS), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7). Those questionnaires and scales were compared by level of prevalence of COVID-19 after validating the questionnaire on psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19. Results: The 19 items on psychosocial experience associated with COVID-19 comprised 5 subscales, with favorable Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.69 to 0.88. Six stress items related to COVID-19 had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.79. Disturbance in eating and sleeping, difficulty with outside activities, stress from COVID-19, and PSS scores were greater in the areas where COVID-19 was highly prevalent. Economic problems, daily activity changes, and anger toward society were higher in the higher-prevalence regions. Discussion: Psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19 was closely related to the prevalence of the disease in the areas where participants lived. Psychosocial interventions for distress associated with COVID-19 should be developed and prepared for people during this lengthy pandemic.

0	COVID-19 Infection in a Child Presenting With Functional Intestinal Obstruction. This report describes the case of a 13-year-old male patient presenting with functional small bowel obstruction. The child was also observed to have persistent tachycardia, and repeat cardiac examination revealed a new-onset cardiac murmur and a gallop rhythm. Acute viral myocarditis was clinically suspected, prompting further cardiac evaluations including electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (echo), and cardiac enzyme panel. Both EKG and echo findings suggested acute myocardial injury, in addition to elevated levels of cardiac enzymes and other inflammatory markers. Considering the ongoing pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was suspected, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Because multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may occur later in the course of COVID-19 illness, a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was performed, with positive results. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of COVID-19 presenting as functional intestinal obstruction. We present this case to share our findings on this unique manifestation of COVID-19 with pediatric colleagues. We also engage in a brief review of MIS-C. Copyright © 2020, Alsabri et al.	false
0	Japanese strategy to COVID-19: How does it work?. Despite substantial inflow of infected cases at the early stage of the pandemic, as of the end of April, Japan manages the outbreak of COVID-19 without systematic breakdown of health care. This Japanese paradox - limited fatality despite loose restriction - may have multiple contributing factors, including general hygiene practice of the population, customs such as not shaking hands or hugging, lower prevalence of obesity and other risk factors. Along with these societal and epidemiological conditions, health policy options, which are characteristic to Japan, would be considered as one of the contribution factors. Some health policy factors relatively unique to Japan are described in this article. Copyright 2020, National Center for Global Health and Medicine.	false
0	A SARS-CoV-2 Reference Standard Quantified by Multiple Digital PCR Platforms for Quality Assessment of Molecular Tests. The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. A reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for the study of limit of detection (LoD), which is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with an accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as a viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (4.6 x 105 +/- 6.5 x 104 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.	false

OBJECTIVES: A severe epidemic of COVID-19 has broken out in China and has become a major global public health event. We focus on the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-like changes and overactivation of Th17 cells (these produce cytokines) in patients with COVID-19. We aim to explore the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab (an injectable drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases) to prevent organ injury caused by the immune response to COVID-19. Ixekizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines., TRIAL DESIGN: The experiment is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the open trial, 3 patients with COVID-19 are treated with ixekizumab, and the safety and efficacy are observed for 7 days. In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. This is a two-center, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial with 2-arm parallel group design (1:1 ratio)., PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 aged 18-75 with increased Interleukin (IL)-6 levels will be enrolled, but patients with severe infections requiring intensive care will be excluded. The trial will be undertaken in two centers. The first stage is carried out in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, and the second stage is carried out simultaneously in the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University., INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In the first stage, three subjects are given ixekizumab (""Taltz"") (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) and antiviral therapy (alpha-interferon (administer 5 million U by aerosol inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (administer 100mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), chloroquine (administer 500mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), ribavirin (administer 500mg by intravenous injection two to three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), or arbidol (administer 200mg by mouth three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), but not more than 3 types). The treatment course of the first stage is 7 days. In the second stage, 40 randomized patients will receive the following treatments--Group 1: ixekizumab (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) with antiviral therapy (the same scheme as in the first stage); Group 2: antiviral therapy alone (the same scheme as in the first stage). The length of the second treatment course is 14 days., MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is a change in pulmonary CT severity score (an imaging tool for assessing COVID-19, which scores on the basis of all abnormal areas involved). Pulmonary CT severity score is assessed on the 7th day, 14th day, or at discharge., RANDOMISATION: In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. The eLite random system of Nanjing Medical University is used for randomization., BLINDING (MASKING): The main efficacy indicator, the CT results, will be evaluated by the third-party blinded and independent research team., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days., TRIAL STATUS: Trial registration number is ChiCTR2000030703 (version 1.7 as of March 19, 2020). The recruitment is ongoing, and the date recruitment was initiated in June 2020. The anticipated date of the end of data collection is June 2021., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The name of the trial register is the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The trial registration number is ChiCTR2000030703 ( http://www.chictr.org.cn/ ). The date of trial registration is 10 March 2020., FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest of expediting the dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

0	CD147-spike protein is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells. In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein. Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection. Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment. Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice. Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient. Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab. Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis. Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.	false
0	Depletion of circulating IgM memory B cells predicts unfavourable outcome in COVID-19. Impaired immune responses have been hypothesised to be a possible trigger of unfavourable outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to characterise IgM memory B cells in patients with COVID-19 admitted to an internal medicine ward in Northern Italy. Overall, 66 COVID-19 patients (mean age 74 +/- 16.6 years; 29 females) were enrolled. Three patients (4.5%; 1 female) had been splenectomised and were excluded from further analyses. Fifty-five patients (87.3%) had IgM memory B cell depletion, and 18 (28.6%) died during hospitalisation (cumulative incidence rate 9.26/100 person-week; 5.8-14.7 95% CI). All patients who died had IgM memory B cell depletion. A superimposed infection was found in 6 patients (9.5%), all of them having IgM memory B cell depletion (cumulative incidence rate 3.08/100 person-week; 1.3-6.8 95% CI). At bivariable analyses, older age, sex, number of comorbidities, and peripheral blood lymphocyte count < 1500/microl were not correlated with IgM memory B cell depletion. A discrete-to-marked reduction of the B-cell compartment was also noticed in autoptic spleen specimens of two COVID-19 patients. We conclude that IgM memory B cells are commonly depleted in COVID-19 patients and this correlates with increased mortality and superimposed infections.	false
0	Systemic microvascular endothelial dysfunction and disease severity in COVID-19 patients: Evaluation by laser Doppler perfusion monitoring and cytokine/chemokine analysis. BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction, serum cytokines and chemokines may play important roles in pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in severe cases., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 underwent non-invasive evaluation of systemic endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity - using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring in the skin of the forearm - coupled to local thermal hyperemia. Maximal microvascular vasodilatation (44degree C thermal plateau phase) was used as endpoint. A multiplex biometric immunoassay was used to assess a panel of 48 serum cytokines and chemokines. Severe COVID-19 (S-COVID) was defined according to WHO criteria, while all other cases of COVID-19 were considered mild to moderate (M-COVID). A group of healthy individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 served as a control group and was also evaluated with LDPM., RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with COVID-19 (25% S-COVID) and 14 controls were included. Basal microvascular flow was similar between M-COVID and controls (P=0.69) but was higher in S-COVID than in controls (P=0.005) and M-COVID patients (P=0.01). The peak microvascular vasodilator response was markedly decreased in both patient groups (M-COVID, P=0.001; S-COVID, P<0.0001) compared to the healthy group. The percent increases in microvascular flow were markedly reduced in both patient groups (M-COVID, P<0.0001; S-COVID, P<0.0001) compared to controls. Patients with S-COVID had markedly higher concentrations of dissimilar proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, compared to patients with M-COVID., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, especially with S-COVID, endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilator responses are reduced, while serum cytokines and chemokines involved in the regulation of vascular function and inflammation are increased.

0	Higher pharyngeal epithelial gene expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 in upper respiratory infection patients. We analyzed the expression of ACE2 in pharyngeal epithelium and examined its relationship with clinical features and serological parameters in the upper respiratory infection (URI) patients. The expression level of ACE2 gene was significantly higher in URI patients (n = 125) than in Healthy control (HC) individuals (n = 52) (p < 0.0001). ACE2 gene expression level was significantly and positively correlated with age (r=0.1799, p = 0.0447) and body temperature (r=0.1927, p = 0.0427), which may help explain increasing coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.

0	Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-59 years: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial. BACKGROUND: With the unprecedented morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. METHOD(S): In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18-59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37.0degreeC, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process (CellSTACK Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose CoronaVac [3 mug per 0.5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 mug per 0.5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38%) of 24 in the 6 mug group, and two (8%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13%) of 24 in the 3 mug group, four (17%) of 24 in the 6 mug group, and three (13%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the 3 mug group, 12 (50%) of 24 in the 6 mug group, and none (0%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 in the 3 mug group, 19 (79%) of 24 in the 6 mug group, and one (4%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33%) of 120 participants in the 3 mug group, 42 (35%) of 120 in the 6 mug group, and 13 (22%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19%) of 120 in the 3 mug group, 23 (19%) of 120 in the 6 mug group, and 11 (18%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92%) of 118 participants in the 3 mug group, 117 (98%) of 119 in the 6 mug group, and two (3%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97%) of 117 in the 3 mug group, 118 (100%) of 118 in the 6 mug group, and none (0%) of 59 in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Taking safety, immunogenicity, and production capacity into account, the 3 mug dose of CoronaVac is the suggested dose for efficacy assessment in future phase 3 trials.

0	Safety and Efficacy of Apixaban For Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill ICU Patients with Severe COVID-19 Respiratory Disease. Introduction Despite the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), rates of thromboembolic disease, and subsequent morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high in patients with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, have numerous purported benefits although the safety and efficacy of their use in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 has yet to be evaluated. Materials and Methods Single-center, retrospective cohort study of 21 ICU patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease treated with apixaban for atrial fibrillation (AFib), venous thromboembolism (VTE), catheter-induced thrombosis, and/or COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. The primary objective was to evaluate the incidence of bleeding events and secondary objectives included thromboembolic events, coagulation parameters, and mortality. Results Ninety percent of patients were non-White, 43% were obese, 90% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 76% required mechanical ventilation. Nearly half of (47.6%) also experienced renal dysfunction and required renal replacement therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received prophylaxis or treatment with UFH or LMWH within the 24-hour period prior to apixaban initiation. Patients were initiated on apixaban for the treatment of suspected or confirmed VTE (67%) or AFib (33%). All coagulation parameters remained abnormal but stable throughout the 10-day monitoring period. No patients experienced any major bleeding events or thrombosis throughout the study period. There were four deaths during the follow-up period, all deemed unrelated to coagulopathy or bleeding. Conclusion Apixaban appeared safe and efficacious in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease. These data encourage future trials seeking to optimize anticoagulation strategies in patients with severe COVID-19. Copyright The Author(s).

0	SUBACUTE THYROIDITIS IN A PATIENT WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019. Objective: Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland that causes destructive thyrotoxicosis and is attributed to a viral or post-viral response. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that caused a global pandemic in 2020. We present a case that suggests that there may be a relationship between SAT and corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., Methods: We describe the clinical findings, thyroid function tests, and neck ultrasound of a patient presenting with anterior neck pain., Results: A 47-year-old, Filipino female presented with anterior neck pain associated with neck tenderness and goiter. She did not have fever or respiratory symptoms but had right lower lobe pneumonia on chest radiograph. Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.05 muIU/mL (reference range is 0.47 to 4.68 muIU/mL), free thyroxine of 1.68 pg/mL (reference range is 0.78 to 2.19 pg/mL), and total triiodothyronine of 1.4 ng/mL (reference range is 0.97 to 1.69 ng/mL). Anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies were negative. Neck ultrasound showed heterogenous thyroid tissues with normal vascularity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were positive. The patient was diagnosed as having SAT and was treated with mefenamic acid, which was later switched to celecoxib. Ceftriaxone and hydroxychloroquine were started for COVID-19 pneumonia. Complete resolution of symptoms and primary hypothyroidism occurred after 2 months., Conclusion: SAT may be a presenting symptom or a sequela of COVID-19. Histopathology studies and definitive documentation of the virus in thyroid tissues may be required to confirm the relationship between SAT and COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 AACE.	false

Control technologies to inactivate airborne viruses effectively are needed during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and to guard against airborne transmitted diseases. We demonstrate that sealed UV-C flow reactors operating with fluences near 253 +/- 1 nm of 13.9-49.6 mJ cm-2 efficiently inactivate coronaviruses in an aerosol. For measurements, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was nebulized in a custom-built, 3.86 m wind tunnel housed in a biosafety level class II facility. The single pass log10 reduction of active coronavirus was in excess of 2.2 at a flow rate of 2439 L min-1 (13.9 mJ cm-2) and in excess of 3.7 (99.98% removal efficiency) at 684 L min-1 (49.6 mJ cm-2). Because virus titers resulting from sampling downstream of the UV-C reactor were below the limit of detection, the true log reduction is likely even higher than measured. Comparison of virus titration results to reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and measurement of fluorescein concentrations (doped into the nebulized aerosol) reveals that the reduction in viable PRCV is primarily due to UV-C based inactivation, as opposed to physical collection of virus. The results confirm that UV-C flow reactors can efficiently inactivate coronaviruses through incorporation into HVAC ducts or recirculating air purifiers.	false
0	Development and Validation of a Multiplex, Bead-Based Assay to Detect Antibodies Directed Against SARS-CoV-2 Proteins. BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay., RESULTS: The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react., CONCLUSIONS: This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.	false
0	T cell and antibody functional correlates of severe COVID-19. Comorbid medical illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with more severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. However, the role of the immune system in mediating these clinical outcomes has not been determined. We used multi-parameter flow cytometry and systems serology to comprehensively profile the functions of T cells and antibodies targeting spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins in a convalescent cohort of COVID-19 subjects who were either hospitalized (n=20) or not hospitalized (n=40). To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4 T-cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects that were not hospitalized. These data reveal a functionally diverse and coordinated response between T cells and antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 which is reduced in the presence of comorbid illnesses that are known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our data suggest that isolated measurements of the magnitudes of spike-specific immune responses are likely insufficient to anticipate vaccine efficacy in high-risk populations.	false
0	Triage process for the assessment of coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients with cancer: The ONCOVID prospective study. BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are considered at high risk for the novel respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). General measures to keep COVID-19-free cancer divisions have been adopted worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of triage to identify COVID-19 among patients with cancer., METHODS: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, data were collected from patients who were treated or followed at the authors' institution in a prospective clinical trial. The primary endpoint was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-positive patients who were identified using a triage process through the aid of medical and patient questionnaires. Based on a diagnostic algorithm, patients with suspect symptoms underwent an infectious disease specialist's evaluation and a COVID-19 swab. Serologic tests were proposed for patients who had symptoms or altered laboratory tests that did not fall into the diagnostic algorithm but were suspicious for COVID-19., RESULTS: Overall, 562 patients were enrolled. Six patients (1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (67%) had the disease detected through telehealth triage, and 2 patients (33%) without suspect symptoms at triage had the disease detected later. Seventy-one patients (13%) had suspect symptoms and/or altered laboratory tests that were not included in the diagnostic algorithm and, of these, 47 patients (73%) underwent testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: 6 (13%) were positive for IgG (n = 5) or for both IgM and IgG (n = 1), and antibody tests were negative in the remaining 41 patients., CONCLUSIONS: The triage process had a positive effect on the detection of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. Telehealth triage was helpful in detecting suspect patients and to keep a COVID-19-free cancer center. The overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (1%) and antibody positivity (13%) in patients with suspect symptoms was similar to that observed in the general population.

0	Vaccines for neglected, emerging and re-emerging diseases. Efforts to produce vaccines against SARS and MERS were prematurely halted since their scope was perceived to be geographically restricted and they were subsequently categorized as neglected diseases. However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs). A customised but sustainable approach is needed to develop and deploy vaccines against NDs. While safety, efficacy and public trust are the three main success pillars for most vaccines, affordability is vital when formulating vaccines for neglected diseases. Copyright © 2020.

OBJECTIVES: The inconclusive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result causes confusion and delay for infection prevention precautions and patient management. We aimed to develop a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results., METHODS: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases)., RESULTS: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result., CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test results are available.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike employs mobile receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to engage the human ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry, which can occur through low-pH-endosomal pathways. To understand how ACE2 binding and low pH affect spike conformation, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures-at serological and endosomal pH-delineating spike recognition of up to three ACE2 molecules. RBDs freely adopted ""up"" conformations required for ACE2 interaction, primarily through RBD movement combined with smaller alterations in neighboring domains. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a solitary all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824-858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning through coordinated movements of the entire trimer apex. These structures provide a foundation for understanding prefusion-spike mechanics governing endosomal entry; we suggest that the low pH all-down conformation potentially facilitates immune evasion from RBD-up binding antibody.

0	Understanding high- and low-quality URL Sharing on COVID-19 Twitter streams. This article investigates the prevalence of high and low quality URLs shared on Twitter when users discuss COVID-19. We distinguish between high quality health sources, traditional news sources, and low quality misinformation sources. We find that misinformation, in terms of tweets containing URLs from low quality misinformation websites, is shared at a higher rate than tweets containing URLs on high quality health information websites. However, both are a relatively small proportion of the overall conversation. In contrast, news sources are shared at a much higher rate. These findings lead us to analyze the network created by the URLs referenced on the webpages shared by Twitter users. When looking at the combined network formed by all three of the source types, we find that the high quality health information network, the low quality misinformation network, and the news information network are all well connected with a clear community structure. While high and low quality sites do have connections to each other, the connections to and from news sources are more common, highlighting the central brokerage role news sources play in this information ecosystem. Our findings suggest that while low quality URLs are not extensively shared in the COVID-19 Twitter conversation, a well connected community of low quality COVID-19 related information has emerged on the web, and both health and news sources are connecting to this community.

As female patients usually experience longer delays before diagnosis and treatment, we assessed whether women were more affected by the dramatic drop in hospital admissions for ACS during the Covid-19 pandemic., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in Northern Italy comparing men and women data. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: the corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and the earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). Incidence rate ratios comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated with the use of Poisson regression., RESULTS: Of the 547 patients who were hospitalized for ACS during the study period, only 127 (23%) were females, accounting for a mean of 3.1 admissions per day, while ACS hospitalized males were 420, with a mean of 10.2 admissions per day. There was a significant decrease driven by a similar reduction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) diagnosis in both sexes compared to the control periods. A trend toward a greater reduction in admitted females was shown in the intra-year control period (46% admission reduction in females vs 37% in males, with females accounting for 26% of ACS, P=0.10) and a significant reduction when compared to the previous year control period (40% admission reduction in females vs 23% in males, with females accounting for 28% of ACS, P=0.03), mainly related to Unstable Angina diagnosis., CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic period closed the gap between men and women in ACS, with similar rates of reduction of hospitalized STEMI and NSTEMI and a trend toward greater reduction in UA admission among women. Furthermore, many typical differences between males and females regarding ischemic heart disease presentations and vessel distribution were leveled. AJCD Copyright © 2020.	false
0	High dose ascorbic acid treatment in COVID-19 patients raised some problems in clinical chemistry testing. Objective: COVID-19 pandemia still continues to threaten the whole world. High dose ascorbic acid (AA) infusion is a choice of treatment and its efficiency is still being investigated. AA interferes with many clinical chemistry tests. However, data about the interference of high concentrations of AA is not sufficient. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interference of AA at high concentrations on commonly used chemistry assays. Material(s) and Method(s): Serum samples at AA concentrations of 200, 150, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2 and 0 mg/dL were prepared by using the stock solution of 15000 mg/dL AA. Each sample was analyzed by using the most common 30 chemistry tests (Abbott Architect C8000, Illinois, USA) and a POCT glucometer (STANDARD GlucoNavii, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). Result(s): Creatinine, sodium and glucose (POCT) tests were found to be positively interfered by increasing AA concentrations; while direct bilirubin, lipase, UIBC, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL/LDL cholesterol tests were negatively interfered. Absolute interference (%) increased as the AA concentration increased. Conclusion(s): This is the largest and first study to investigate the interference of high dose AA, which is used in severe COVID-19 patients nowadays. Manufacturers and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of aberrant results due to high dose AA infusion. Clinicians should not forget to consult a laboratory specialist, since he is the only person to monitor the reactions in all assays, and know the technical subjects like interferences, assay method specifications. This issue is very important for correct decision-making and interpretation of the data-mining studies accurately and efficiently.Copyright © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.	false

COVID-19 affects vulnerable populations including elderly individuals and patients with cancer. Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate-immune TRAIL suppress transformed and virally-infected cells. ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity. We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. In serum-deprived and stimulated cells treated with remdesivir and MEKi we observed correlations between pRB, pERK, and ACE2 expression further supporting role of proliferative state and MAPK pathway in ACE2 regulation. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19-(+) patient plasma (N = 9) versus control (N = 11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1alpha, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or with remdesivir. We observed MEKi stimulation of NK-cell killing of target-cells, without suppressing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus with a lentiviral core and SARS-CoV-2 D614 or G614 SPIKE (S) protein on its envelope infected human bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or lung cancer cells and MEKi suppressed infectivity of the pseudovirus. We show a drug class-effect with MEKi to stimulate NK cells, inhibit inflammatory cytokines and block host-factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection leading also to suppression of SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infection of human cells. MEKi may attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection to allow immune responses and antiviral agents to control disease progression. Copyright: © 2020 Zhou et al.	false
0	What Emotion Facial Expressions Tell Us About the Health of Others. To avoid contagion, we need information about the health status of those whom we engage with. This is especially important when we have cause for concern that the other is indeed sick, such as is the case during the world-wide outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020. In three studies, one conducted several years before the pandemic, and two during the pandemic, we showed that facial expressions of emotions are used as signals of health status. Specifically, happy expressers are perceived as healthier than expressers showing negative emotions or neutrality (Studies 1-3), whereas anger was interpreted as a signal of ill health (Study 3). Importantly, however, facial expressions affected health perception only when there was a prior reason to suspect ill health. This was the case for older expressers before and after the pandemic for whom age-related stereotypes set expectations of ill health and for all ages during a wide-spread pandemic, which extends this suspicion to everyone. In Study 3, we showed that the effect of emotion expressions was also generalized to the physical distance that the observer wishes to keep from the expresser. Overall, this research is the first to show a role of emotion expressions in informing health perception. Copyright © 2020 Hareli, David and Hess.	false

AIM: To evaluate incidental findings in major trauma patients, and to explore whether computed tomography (CT) could be used to assess prevalence and estimate disease spread in the general population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included all patients admitted following major trauma between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 with CT including the lungs (n=523). Major trauma patients admitted pre-COVID-19 from 1-31 January and 1-31 March 2019 comprised a control group (n=252). The assessing radiologists, blinded to the time period, used double reading with consensus to determine if the patient had CT signs of COVID-19. Lung appearances were classified as no evidence of COVID-19; minor signs; or major signs. The proportion of patients with incidental COVID-19 changes was recorded over the study period, and the percentage of the population who had been affected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020 estimated., RESULTS: CT appearances consistent with COVID-19 began to exceed a background pre-COVID rate in the second week of February and did not decline until 2 weeks after lockdown. By the end of April 2020, approximately 45% of the population had been infected., CONCLUSIONS: CT of major trauma patients can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19. This novel technique could be used retrospectively or prospectively anywhere where trauma scans are available, to monitor the disease in the local population.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently linked to dermatologic manifestations and is thought to affect more severely patients with androgenetic alopecia. We designed a prospective multicentric study which enrolled patients from March to August of 2020 with acute telogen effluvium (ATE) that had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed either by serological tests (e.g. detection of serum antibodies against the virus via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)) or detection of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

0	Influence of Sars-Cov 2 lockdown on the incidence of facial trauma in a tertiary care hospital in Rome, Italy. OBJECTIVES: Italy has been the first affected country in the western haemisphere by SARS-COV 2 with over 200.000 cases during the first months o the pandemica. To control the spread of the virus, the whole country was placed under lockdown with limitations in the circulation of people and vehicles from March 2020 to the first half of the month of May., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to analyze the incidence and type of facial traumas referred to our tertiary care hospital during the months of Italy lockdown due to SARS - COVID 2 spread compared with those during the same months of 2019 to determine eventual variations in the incidence, type and causes of trauma., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: During the 2 months of COVID-19-related lockdown, a dramatic decrease in facial trauma patients was observed at our tertiary care hospital with a shift toward older age ranges. Regarding the causes of trauma, the largest percentage reduction was found in road, sports and work accidents; this percentage reduction was not found in aggressions. A small increase in the percentage was also found regarding surgical indications, likely because more severe cases were more prone to be referred to the hospital despite the fear of being infected.	false

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of food-assisted maternal and child health programs (FA-MCHN) on child wasting., OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of Tubaramure, a FA-MCHN program in Burundi, on child (0 to 24 months) wasting and the differential impacts by socio-economic characteristics and age. The program targeted women and their children during the first 1000 days and included 1) food rations, 2) strengthening and promotion of use of health services, and 3) behavior change communication (BCC)., METHODS: We conducted a 4-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (2010-2012). Clusters were defined as ""collines"" (communities). Impact was estimated using repeated cross-sectional data (n = ~2620 children in each round). Treatment arms received household and individual (mother or child in the first 1000 days) food rations (corn-soy blend and micronutrient-fortified vegetable oil) from pregnancy to 24 months (T24 arm), from pregnancy to 18 months (T18), or from birth to 24 months (TNFP). All beneficiaries received the same BCC for the first 1000 days. The control arm received no rations or BCC., RESULTS: Wasting (weight-for-length Z-score <2 SD) increased from baseline to follow-up in the control group (from 6.5% to 8%), but Tubaramure had a significant (P < 0.05) protective effect on wasting [treatment arms combined, -3.3 percentage points (pp); T18, -4.5 pp] and on the weight-for-length z-score (treatment arms combined, +0.15; T24, +0.20; T18, +0.17). The effects were limited to children whose mother and household head had no education, and who lived in the poorest households. The largest effect was found in children 6 to 12 months of age: the group with the highest wasting prevalence., CONCLUSIONS: FA-MCHN programs in highly food-insecure regions can protect the most disadvantaged children from wasting. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of the economic crisis due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is expected to dramatically increase child wasting.

0	The Development of a Novel Nanobody Therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2. Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics. We identified a novel series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), Nanosota-1, from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that Nanosota-1 bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking out viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug possessing an Fc tag ( Nanosota-1C-Fc ) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a K d of 15.7picomolar (~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did) and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with an ND 50 of 0.16microgram/milliliter (~6000 times more potently than ACE2 did). Administered at a single dose, Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy in hamsters subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike conventional antibody drugs, Nanosota-1C-Fc was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of Nanosota-1C-F c documented a greater than 10-day in vivo half-life efficacy and high tissue bioavailability. Nanosota-1C-Fc is a potentially effective and realistic solution to the COVID-19 pandemic., Impact statement: Potent and low-cost Nanosota-1 drugs block SARS-CoV-2 infections both in vitro and in vivo and act both preventively and therapeutically.	false

0	Epidemiological and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in an area of the Colombian Caribbean. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging viral pandemic disease. In the last 6 months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of reported cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. As other world regions, South America has not contained the pandemic's advance since it lacks the hospital and economic capacities. Public health implications of transmission, while the asymptomatic/presymptomatic infection is a critical concern at the current pandemic., OBJECTIVE: Describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the Colombian Caribbean., METHODS: Six hundred eighty-six clinical samples of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and contacts individuals from several hospital centers in the department of Cordoba, Colombia, were received at our laboratory between April 9th and May 16th, 2020. RNA was extracted using lysis buffers and spin columns. The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 3 target genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex TM, 2019-nCoV assay, Korea). Viral copies quantification was done using a standard curve constructed from seriated dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. Statics descriptive methods were used., RESULTS: Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the average age was 43 (range, 1-95 years). Seventeen of 35 (49%) of the patients showed symptoms. Most of them had a cough, fever, and odynophagia; three of the patients reported having arthralgia. Only two patients required hospitalization. None of the patients had known co-morbidities. RT-qPCR results show that two of the symptomatic patients had significantly higher RNA copies than the rest. Eighteen of 35 (51%) individuals were asymptomatic, and the average age was 30 (range, 6-61 years). Four asymptomatic individuals showed a higher copy than some symptomatic patients; nonetheless, the average of RNA copies 8.26 x 1010 was lower than the symptomatic., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that asymptomatic patients may develop infections with a high number of RNA copies. Since a considerable percentage of infections may be asymptomatic/presymptomatic, enhanced testing approaches may be needed to detect these persons. Due the occurrence of a large proportion of infections being a result from transmission originated in asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals, public health interventions in Colombia should be based on two steps: a massive molecular screening, and viral load quantification. Finally, a remarkable issue in our study is the average age of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (43 and 30 respectively) which may be important because of the economic impact that has been caused by the coronavirus pandemic and may be probably the cause of the reduced lethality observed in the country and the department at the time of this study.	false
0	A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine for Prevention of Covid-19. BACKGROUND: Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited to nonpharmacologic interventions. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking., METHODS: We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days., RESULTS: The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported., CONCLUSIONS: Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient.

0	COVID-19 associated with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia. BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has many known disease associations, including autoimmune, lymphoproliferative, and certain infectious diseases, as well as various medications. Studies have found that severe cases of COVID-19 may be associated with coagulopathies, however the potential association with AIHA is not clear., CASE REPORT: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID-19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions prior to clinical stabilization., DISCUSSION: AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA, however there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID-19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID-19 are discussed., CONCLUSION: There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.

0	Biventricular Takotsubo Syndrome with COVID-19 in an Asian Male. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to affect the cardiovascular system, and several cases of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) induced by COVID-19 have been reported. TTS predominantly affects postmenopausal women in western countries, but the prevalence in men is higher in Asian populations. It should be noted that male patients with either TTS or COVID-19 are associated with higher mortality. Despite the higher prevalence of TTS in Asian men, little is known about Asian men with TTS induced by COVID-19. This is a case report of a 60-year-old Asian male with biventricular TTS precipitated by COVID-19. He presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic shock, and acute kidney injury. He required intubation, multiple vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 15%, but it normalized in 5 weeks. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay in a critical condition, but was eventually discharged alive. The scarce literature about this condition in Asian male populations and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Asian countries highlight the rarity and importance of this case. Further studies are warranted to investigate the uneven sex distribution and outcomes of TTS triggered by COVID-19 in an Asian population.

0	COVID-19 infection among people with HIV in New York City: A population-level analysis of linked surveillance data. BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) was hard-hit by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and is also home to a large population of people with HIV (PWH)., METHODS: We matched lab-confirmed COVID-19 case and death data reported to the NYC Health Department as of June 2, 2020, against the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We describe and compare the characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes of PWH diagnosed with COVID-19 with all NYC PWH and with all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19., RESULTS: Through June 2, 204,583 NYC COVID-19 cases were reported. The registry match identified 2,410 PWH with diagnosed COVID-19 eligible for analysis (1.06% of all COVID-19 cases). Compared with all NYC PWH and all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were older, male, Black or Latino, and living in high-poverty neighborhoods. At least one underlying condition was reported for 58.9% of PWH with COVID-19. Compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 experienced hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and/or death; most PWH who experienced poor COVID-19-related outcomes had CD4 <500 cells/microL., CONCLUSIONS: Given NYC HIV prevalence is 1.5%, PWH were not overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. However, compared with NYC COVID-19 cases overall, a greater proportion of PWH had adverse COVID-19-related outcomes, perhaps because of a higher prevalence of factors associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Given the pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, HIV public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support for people living with and affected by HIV.

0	Clinical characteristics of the first known cases of death caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19 has resulted in many deaths worldwide. Here, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of the first 17 reported cases of death due to COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Demographics, initial symptoms, complications, chest computerized tomography (CT) images, treatments, and prognoses were collected and analyzed from the National Health Committee of China data. The first 17 reported deaths from COVID-19 were predominately in older men; 82.35% of patients were older than 65 years, and 76.47% were males. The most common initial symptoms were fever or fatigue (14 cases, 82.35%), respiratory symptoms, such as cough (12 cases, 70.59%), and neurological symptoms, such as headache (3 cases, 17.65%). The most common finding of chest CT was viral pneumonia (5 cases, 29.41%). Anti-infectives (11 cases, 64.71%) and mechanical ventilation (9 cases, 52.94%) were commonly used for treatment. Most of the patients (16 cases, 94.12%) died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our findings show that advanced age and male gender are effective predictors of COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that early interventions to reduce the incidence of ARDS may improve prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.	false
0	Acute Invasive Rhino-Orbital Mucormycosis in a Patient With COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a rare, although highly morbid, infection primarily affecting immunosuppressed individuals. The same population is at particularly high risk of complications and mortality in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. The authors present a case of acute invasive fungal rhino-orbital mucormycosis in a patient with COVID-19 and discuss the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal coinfections in COVID-19. Prompt recognition, initiation of therapy, and consideration of the challenges of rapidly evolving COVID-19 therapy guidelines are important for improving patient survival.	false
0	Safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine administered in a prime-boost regimen in young and old adults (COV002): a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial. BACKGROUND: Older adults (aged >=70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed. Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older., METHODS: In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged >=65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2.2 x 1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3.5-6.5 x 1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137., FINDINGS: Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged >=56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898-33 550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233-40 353], n=26; and >=70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705-37 796], n=47; p=0.68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and >=70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0.40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and >=70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48)., INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities., FUNDING: UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midlands NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.

0	Are diabetes and its medications risk factors for the development of COVID-19? Data from a population-based study in Sicily. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been associated with higher incidence of severe cases of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, but it is unknown whether DM is a risk factor for the overall COVID-19 incidence. The aim of present study was to investigate whether there is an association of DM with COVID-19 prevalence and case fatality, and between different DM medications and risk for COVID-19 infection and death., METHODS AND RESULTS: retrospective observational study on all SARS-CoV-2 positive (SARS-CoV-2+) cases and deaths in Sicily up to 2020, May 14th. No difference in COVID-19 prevalence was found between people with and without DM (RR 0.92 [0.79-1.09]). Case fatality was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2+ with DM (RR 4.5 [3.55-5.71]). No diabetes medication was associated with differences in risk for SARS-Cov2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: in Sicily, DM was not a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, whereas it was associated with a higher case fatality.

0	Gynecological cancers and the global COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has reduced the availability of health resources which will affect treatment of gynecological cancers. The present study aimed to provide a treatment protocol for patients with gynecological cancers during the global COVID-19 pandemic. International databases with keywords of COVID-19; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; gynecologic cancer; cervical cancer; and vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, tumor, elective surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancer, guideline, guidance, women, management, outpatient clinic visits, and triage were comprehensively searched. All the obtained guidelines were studied and the contents were summarized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, early stage endometrial cancer was preferably treated with hormone therapy while radiotherapy was given in preference in later stages. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be treated immediately after diagnosis using at least a loop electrosurgical excision procedure while any major surgery should be postponed by 10-12 weeks. In the early stage of cervical cancer, surgery may be delayed by 2-4 weeks, and radiotherapy prescribed for the intervening period. In cases of an ovarian mass with negative tumor markers, no sign of cancer on imaging investigations, no ascites, a low serum CA-125 level, and no papillary projection or vegetation in the base of the cyst, the patient may be given hormone therapy for 2-3 months. In cases of newly diagnosed confirmed ovarian cancers, surgery should be performed as early as possible (maximum: 2-3 weeks). Vulvar and vaginal cancers can be treated within 10-12 weeks of diagnosis, but radiotherapy should be given in preference in this situation. A molar pregnancy is an oncological emergency for which a suction curettage is mandatory; the patient must be monitored for metastases. Information concerning the choice between open or laparoscopic surgery is limited. Given that any patient may be an asymptomatic carrier of the coronavirus, major surgery should be preceded by chest computerized tomography, with and without contrast medium, in order to detect lung lesions. Evidence concerning these recommendations is limited because of the novel and unknown nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, data pertaining to ethical debates about delayed treatment and treatment approaches deviating from current guidelines are also limited.	false
0	Neurosurgery in times of a pandemic: a survey of neurosurgical services during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Veneto region in Italy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and of the subsequent lockdown on the neurosurgical services of the Veneto region in Italy compared to the previous 4 years., METHODS: A survey was conducted in all 6 neurosurgical departments in the Veneto region to collect data about surgical, inpatient care and endovascular procedures during the month of March for each year from 2016 to 2020. Safety measures to avoid infection from SARS-CoV-2 and any COVID-19 cases reported among neurosurgical patients or staff members were considered., RESULTS: The mean number of neurosurgical admissions for the month of March over the 2016-2019 period was 663, whereas in March 2020 admissions decreased by 42%. Emergency admissions decreased by 23%. The average number of neurosurgical procedures was 697, and declined by 30% (range -10% to -51% in individual centers). Emergency procedures decreased in the same period by 23%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage both decreased in Veneto-by 25% and 22%, respectively. Coiling for unruptured aneurysm, coiling for ruptured aneurysm, and surgery for ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation diminished by 49%, 27%, and 78%, respectively. Endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) increased by 33% in 2020 (28 procedures in total). There was a slight decrease (8%) in brain tumor surgeries. Neurosurgical admissions decreased by 25% and 35% for head trauma and spinal trauma, respectively, while surgical procedures for head trauma diminished by 19% and procedures for spinal trauma declined by 26%. Admissions and surgical treatments for degenerative spine were halved. Eleven healthcare workers and 8 patients were infected in the acute phase of the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study describes the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak on neurosurgical activities in a vast region in Italy. Remodulation of neurosurgical activities has resulted in a significant reduction of elective and emergency surgeries compared to previous years. Most likely this is a combined result of cancellation of elective and postponable surgeries, increase of conservative management, increase in social restrictions, and in patients' fear of accessing hospitals. Curiously, only endovascular procedures for AIS have increased, possibly due to reduced physical activity or increased thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2. The confounding effect of thrombectomy increase over time cannot be excluded. No conclusion can be drawn on AIS incidence. Active monitoring with nasopharyngeal swabs, wearing face masks, and using separate pathways for infected patients reduce the risk of infection.	false
0	"Chest CT scan features from 302 patients with COVID-19 in Jordan. Objective: To study non-enhanced computer tomographic features of chest imaging in 302 patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Jordan., Material and method: A retrospective analysis of non-enhanced computer tomographic scans has been performed in the main center for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Prince Hamzah Hospital for those scanned from 13th of March 2020 to 13th of May 2020. Included scans were routinely performed during 24-hs of admission apart from having respiratory complaint. CT protocol included non-enhanced 1 mm slice thickness by Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands). All computer tomographic scans were reviewed by two senior radiologists with more than 8 years of experience each and senior registrar. Several factors have been thoroughly studied including patient age, gender, positive versus negative pulmonary findings, laterality of lung involvement, lobar distribution, pattern of pulmonary changes on initial and follow-up scans., Results: The total number of patients evaluated was 302. There were 188 men and 114 women studied. Among the totally studied 302 cases; 181 cases (59.9 %) showed no pulmonary changes.Positive findings were present in 121 patients with a total number of 191 computer tomographic scans including initial and follow-up scans. Positive findings were present in 51 female and 70 male patients (age range, 12-87 years; mean age +/- standard deviation, 46.1 +/- 16.5). Bilateral disease was more frequently encountered presented in 86 cases (71.1 %), while unilateral disease showed two times more predilection for the right lung compared to the left. The incidence of lobar involvement in descending order: right lower (75.2 %), left lower (71.9 %), right upper (62.8 %), left upper (60.3 %) and right middle (50.4 %). The incidence of the affected lobes on the initial scans were as follow: one lobe (24 %), two lobes (10.7 %), three lobes (9.1 %), four lobes (16.5 %) five lobes (36.4 %). In cases with single lobar involvement (24 %); the left upper and right middle lobes showed lowest incidence of involvement accounting for 10.3 % & 13.8 %, respectively; on the other hand, in cases with four lobar involvement (16.5 %); the right middle lobe was most commonly spared in two third of cases (63.2 %). Several initial patterns of the pulmonary changes resulting from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were present with a descending order; ground-glass pattern (96.7 %), lenticular pattern (32.2 %), Halo sign (15.7 % %), rounded (14.9 %), nodular (10.7 %), ground-glass with consolidation (8.3 %), tree-in-bud (1.7 %) and pleural effusion (1.7 %). Pathologically-enlarged lymph node was not a feature of COVID-19. The total number of patients with positive findings having follow-up scans was 57 including single (45 patients) versus two (12 patients) follow-up scans. Initial follow up scans showed regression and progression of the pulmonary changes in 35 and 22 patients, respectively.A remarkable pattern was seen in almost all regressed cases that showed patchy reticular pattern changes with septal thickening which was referred to ""pulmonary synapses"" (34 patients) with only one patient showed complete resolution of the parenchymal changes. Patterns seen in progressed cases were lenticular ground-glass (63.6 %) vs patchy ground-glass (36.4 %) patterns., Conclusion: Computer tomographic scan of the chest is a principal diagnostic measure for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pulmonary changes showed more propensity being bilateral disease and affecting the lower lobes, while the right middle lobe was the least likely involvement. Several pattern of pulmonary changes can be seen on initial scans including ground glass, consolidation, Halo sign, lenticular, nodular, pleural effusion and tree-in-bud patterns. The tree-in-bud is first-time described pattern of COVID-19 in the current article and thought to be an excluding criterion. In follow-up scans; the lenticular and patchy ground-glass patterns were present in cases with disease progression, compared with ""pulmonary synapses"" pattern encountered in cases with disease regression.

0	Incidence, Clinical Characteristics, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients With COVID-19: Results of the UMC-19-S12. OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who were attending the emergency department (ED), before hospitalization., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with UGB in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We formed 2 control groups: COVID-19 patients without UGB (control group A) and non-COVID-19 patients with UGB (control group B). Fifty-three independent variables and 4 outcomes were compared between cases and controls., RESULTS: We identified 83 UGB in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 who were attending EDs (1.11%, 95% CI=0.88-1.38). This incidence was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients [2474/1,388,879, 1.78%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.71-1.85; odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 95% CI=0.50-0.77]. Clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 patients presenting with UGB were abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, dyspnea, expectoration, melena, fever, cough, chest pain, and dysgeusia. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients with UGB, COVID-19 patients with UGB more frequently had fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, interstitial lung infiltrates, and ground-glass lung opacities. They underwent fewer endoscopies in the ED (although diagnoses did not differ between cases and control group B) and less endoscopic treatment. After adjustment for age and sex, cases showed a higher in-hospital all-cause mortality than control group B (OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.09-3.86) but not control group A (OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.59-2.19) patients., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UGB in COVID-19 patients attending EDs was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients. Digestive symptoms predominated over respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 patients with UGB underwent fewer gastroscopies and endoscopic treatments than the general population with UGB. In-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with UGB was increased compared with non-COVID patients with UGB, but not compared with the remaining COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Brain MRI findings in severe COVID-19: A retrospective observational study. Background: Brain MRI parenchymal signal abnormalities have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Purpose(s): To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe COVID-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain MRI findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain MRI or brain MRI showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P < .05 represented a significant difference. Result(s): Thirty men (81%) and seven women (19%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years +/- 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41%), confusion (12 of 37, 32%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19%). The most frequent MRI findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 59%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30%; 95% CI: 15%, 45%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24%; 95% CI: 10%, 38%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65%], P = .005). Only one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusion(s): Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and without ischemic infarcts had a wide range of neurologic manifestations that were associated with abnormal brain MRI scans. Eight distinctive neuroradiologic patterns were described.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.	false

BACKGROUND: Severe courses of COVID-19 are associated with elevated levels of interleukin 6. However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19., METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles., RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.

0	Co-infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus enhances the severity of pneumonia in golden Syrian hamsters. BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of the interaction between the co-circulating pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and seasonal influenza viruses are unknown. METHOD(S): We established a golden Syrian hamster model co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 and mouse-adapted A(H1N1)pdm09 simultaneously or sequentially. The weight loss, clinical scores, histopathological changes, viral load and titer, and serum neutralizing antibody titre were compared with hamsters challenged by either virus. RESULT(S): Co-infected hamsters had more weight loss, more severe lung inflammatory damage and tissue cytokine/chemokine expression. Lung viral load, infectious virus titers and virus antigen expression suggested that hamsters were generally more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequential co-infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 exposure resulted in a lower lung SARS-CoV-2 titer and viral load than with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone, but a higher lung A(H1N1)pdm09 viral load. Co-infection also increased intestinal inflammation with more SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein expression in enterocytes. Simultaneous co-infection was associated with delay in resolution of lung damages, lower serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and longer SARS-CoV-2 shedding in oral swabs compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. CONCLUSION(S): Simultaneous or sequential co-infection by SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more severe disease than infection by either virus in hamsters. Prior A(H1N1)pdm09 infection lowered SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary viral loads but enhanced lung damage. Whole-population influenza vaccination for prevention of co-infection, and multiplex molecular diagnostics for both viruses to achieve early initiation of antiviral treatment for improvement of clinical outcome should be considered.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	An insight into the interaction between alpha-ketoamide- based inhibitor and coronavirus main protease: A detailed in silico study. The search for therapeutic drugs that can neutralize the effects of COVID-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the main focus of current research. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, alpha-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of alpha-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 SgammaH) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the alpha-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 SgammaH to His41 Ndelta forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the alpha-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the alpha-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal. We computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all stationary points including transition states via ONIOM and pure DFT method. Additionally, to characterize covalent, weak noncovalent interaction (NCI) and hydrogen-bonds, we applied NCI-reduced density gradient (NCI-RDG) methods along with Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms-in-Molecules (QTAIM) and natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis.

0	More that ACE2? NRP1 may play a central role in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and its association with enhanced survival. Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction; obstruction of the olfactory cleft; epithelial injury and infection of the sustentacular supporting cells, which are known to express ACE2, or injury to the olfactory bulb due to axonal transport through olfactory sensory neurones. The absence of ACE2 expression by olfactory sensory neurones has led to the neurotropic potential of COVID-19 to be discounted. While an accumulating body of evidence supports olfactory epithelial injury as an important mechanism, this does not account for all the features of olfactory dysfunction seen in COVID-19; for example the duration of loss in some patients, evidence of changes within the olfactory bulb on MRI imaging, identification of viral particles within the olfactory bulb in post-mortem specimens and the inverse association between severity of COVID-19 and the prevalence of olfactory loss. The recent identification of a second route of viral entry mediated by NRP1 addresses many of these inconsistencies. Expression by the olfactory sensory neurones and their progenitor cells may facilitate direct injury and axonal transport to the olfactory bulb as well as a mechanism for delayed or absent recovery. Expression by regulatory T cells may play a central role in the cytokine storm. Variability in expression by age, race or gender may explain differing morbidity of infection and inverse association between anosmia and severity; in the case of higher expression there may be a higher risk of olfactory function but greater activation of regulatory T cells that may suppress the cytokine storm.

0	Prevalence of Internet Addiction during the COVID-19 Outbreak and Its Risk Factors among Junior High School Students in Taiwan. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has significantly disrupted normal activities globally. During this epidemic, people around the world were expected to encounter several mental health challenges. In particular, Internet addiction may become a serious issue among teens. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of Internet addiction and identify the psychosocial risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study was constructed using a cross-sectional design with 1060 participants recruited from among junior high school students around Taiwan using stratified and cluster sampling methods. Taiwan's first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 28 January 2020. New cases exploded rapidly in February, and as a result, participants were surveyed during March 2 through 27 March 2020. The prevalence of Internet addiction was found to be 24.4% during this period. High impulsivity, high virtual social support, older in age, low subjective well-being, low family function, and high alexithymia was all independently predictive in the forward logistic regression analyses. The prevalence rate of Internet addiction was high among junior high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results from this study can be used to help mental health organizations and educational agencies design programs that will help prevent Internet addiction in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	High Prevalence of Deep Venous Thrombosis in Non-Severe COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized for a Neurovascular Disease. INTRODUCTION: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 along with venous thromboembolic occurrences particularly in intensive care units. For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients., METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS., RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0-11)., DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.

0	Infant feeding initiation practices in the context of COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVE: Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown., STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 'hotspot' in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)., RESULTS: The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (-15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03 +/- 4.88 vs. 8.03 +/- 4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 +/- 0.65 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62 +/- 0.60 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the 'hotspot' COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.

0	SARS-CoV-2 spike protein promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of angiotensin II receptor signaling in epithelial cells. Cytokine storm is suggested as one of the major pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the mechanism for initiation of a hyper-inflammatory response, and multi-organ damage from viral infection is poorly understood. In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-kappaB and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in epithelial cells promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of the AT1 axis to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response.	false
0	Time varying Markov process with partially observed aggregate data: An application to coronavirus. A major difficulty in the analysis of Covid-19 transmission is that many infected individuals are asymptomatic. For this reason, the total counts of infected individuals and of recovered immunized individuals are unknown, especially during the early phase of the epidemic. In this paper, we consider a parametric time varying Markov process of Coronavirus transmission and show how to estimate the model parameters and approximate the unobserved counts from daily data on infected and detected individuals and the total daily death counts. This model-based approach is illustrated in an application to French data, performed on April 6, 2020. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Structured reporting in portable chest radiographs: An essential tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19. PURPOSE: To date, the majority of chest imaging studies in COVID-19 pneumonia have focused on CT. Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also measured., RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6 %) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1 % (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). A patient with a positive CXR had an 88 % (95 % CI 80-96 %) probability of having a positive RT-PCR during a period of high incidence, early in the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSION: Using a structured approach, a positive CXR had a high likelihood of predicting a positive RT-PCR, with good interrater reliability. CXRs can be useful in identifying new cases of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	The Impact of Dementia on the Clinical Outcome of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought large challenges to dementia patients. We reviewed the existing literature on COVID-19 to assess the incidence and mortality of dementia comorbidities in COVID-19 patients., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of pre-existing dementia comorbidities on COVID-19., METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for patients with preexisting dementia who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The statistical data on the prevalence and mortality of dementia comorbidities were examined. A fixed-or random-effect model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. Forest plots were generated to show the summarized results., RESULTS: A total of 265 articles were retrieved from the three databases. After removing duplicates and performing two screenings, 10 articles were selected for meta-analysis, including 119,218 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies showed that the incidence of dementia in COVID-19 patients was (R: 9%, [95% CI: 6% to 13%]). Moreover, the meta-analysis of 9 studies showed that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 was higher than that of individuals with no dementia (OR: 5.17 [95% CI: 2.31 to 11.59]). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Significant publication bias was also found., CONCLUSION: Emerging literature shows that dementia comorbidities are a high risk factor for the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Our results should have an impact on preventive interventions and encourage more targeted approaches to prioritize older people with specific risk factors, such as dementia.	false

0	Clinical features and viral diagnosis of two cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus: A report of nosocomial transmission. Background Human infection with a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012, with 44 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 23, 2013. We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital. Methods Patient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad. Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders. We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV. Findings Initial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea. Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Both patients developed acute renal failure. MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22*9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22*5 for upE and 23*9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive. The two patients shared the same room for 3 days. The incubation period was estimated at 9-12 days for the second case. No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.	false
0	"Characteristic of Chronic Plaque Psoriasis Patients Treated with Biologics in Italy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk Analysis from the PSO-BIO-COVID Observational Study. Background The susceptibility of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and the risks or benefits related to the use of biological therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Few data about prevalence, clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 among psoriatic patients were reported. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents during the first phase of the emergency (22 February to 22 April 2020) in Italy, and 2) to report the clinical outcomes of patients who have been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, aged >=18 years and undergoing treatment with biologic agents as of 22 February 2020, were eligible to be included in PSO-BIO-COVID study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients using any biologic for psoriasis treatment between 22 February and 22 April 2020 were registered. For all confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, data about concomitant disease, ongoing therapies, and comorbidities were also reported. Results A total of 12,807 psoriatic patients were included in the PSO-BIO-COVID study. In this cohort twenty-six patients (0.2%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eleven patients required hospitalization and two died. 125 of 12807 patients (1.0%) with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 under quarantine or active health surveillance, were reported. Conclusion The incidence of COVID-19 observed in our cohort of psoriatic patients (0.2%) is similar to that seen in the general population (0.31%) in Italy. However, the course of the disease was mild in most patients. Biological therapies may likely lessen ""cytokine storm"" of COVID-19, which sometimes lead to multiple organ failure, ARDS, and death."	false
0	Unusual gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19: two case reports. As of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, following an epidemic of a fast-spreading viral respiratory disease, later called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which then lead to the present pandemic the world has come to know. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. It has become evident that the ACE2 receptor plays a significant role as the entry site into human cells for the virus. This receptor is generally expressed in respiratory cells, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, corresponding with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Studies concluded that the origin of gastrointestinal symptoms could be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells through the ACE2 receptor. The findings of the present study support this theory, as both patients presented with symptoms regarding tissues with high ACE2 expression.

0	Clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and concurrent IgA nephropathy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there is accumulating data on the clinical characteristics, treatment strategies and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with concurrent renal disease. Postmortem investigations reveal renal involvement in COVID-19, and most recently, several biopsy researches reveal that acute tubular injury, as well as glomerular nephropathy such as collapsing glomerulopathy were common histological findings. However, to our best knowledge, there is limited data regarding IgA nephropathy in the setting of COVID-19., CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case, we report a 65-year old Chinese woman who presented with dark-colored urine, worsening proteinuria and decreased renal function after COVID-19 infection. She received a renal biopsy during COVID-19 infection. The renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy without any evidence for SARS-Cov-2. The findings suggest that the renal abnormalities were a consequence of exacerbation of this patient's underlying glomerular disease after COVID-19 infection. After a regimen of 3-day course of glucocorticoid and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy, the patient recovered and remained stable upon follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the underlying glomerular disease exacerbation as well as virus induced injury when dealing with renal abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. A kidney biopsy may be indicated to exclude a rapidly progressive glomerular disease.	false
0	Effects of universal masking on Massachusetts healthcare workers' COVID-19 incidence. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) and other essential workers are at risk of occupational infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias., AIMS: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general population., METHODS: We compared the 7-day average incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from 17 March (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to 6 May (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on 26 March, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was 20 April. Thus, we categorized 17-31 March as the pre-intervention phase, 1-20 April the intervention phase and 21 April to 6 May the epidemic decline phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models., RESULTS: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre-intervention and epidemic decline phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare system's epidemic slope became negative (standardized beta: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.31), while Massachusetts' slope remained positive (standardized beta: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking was associated with a decreasing COVID-19 incidence trend among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.

0	Higher viral loads in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients might be the invisible part of the iceberg. PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics in different hosts and different samples and their relationship with disease severity have not been clearly revealed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients., METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory., RESULTS: A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load.	false
0	Case Study: Prolonged Infectious SARS-CoV-2 Shedding from an Asymptomatic Immunocompromised Individual with Cancer. Long-term severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding was observed from the upper respiratory tract of a female immunocompromised individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was observed up to 70 days, and of genomic and subgenomic RNA up to 105 days, after initial diagnosis. The infection was not cleared after the first treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting a limited effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of this individual. Several weeks after a second convalescent plasma transfusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was no longer detected. We observed marked within-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with continuous turnover of dominant viral variants. However, replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial tissues were not affected. Our data indicate that certain immunocompromised individuals may shed infectious virus longer than previously recognized. Detection of subgenomic RNA is recommended in persistently SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals as a proxy for shedding of infectious virus. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"Temporal variations in the diagnostic performance of chest CT for Covid-19 depending on disease prevalence: Experience from North-Eastern France. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to analyze temporal variations in the diagnostic performance of chest CT for Covid-19 throughout the first wave, depending on disease prevalence variations between the ascending, peak and descending phases of the epidemic in North-Eastern France., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd 2020, all consecutive adult patients referred to the ""Covid-19 clinic"" of our Emergency Department with the availability of chest CT and of at least one RT-PCR result were retrospectively included in the present study. Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily. CT diagnostic performance were calculated and variations between phases were tested for equivalence or difference using Bayesian methods., RESULTS: 2194 consecutive chest CT were analyzed. Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists. Variations between the ascending (11 days, 281 chest CT, disease prevalence 37.0 %), the peak (18 days, 1167 chest CT, disease prevalence 64 %) and the descending phases (19 days, 746 chest CT, disease prevalence 32.2 %) were highest for PPV and NPV with a probability of difference >99.9 %, and smallest for accuracy and specificity with a probability of equivalence >98.8 %., CONCLUSION: In a homogenous cohort of 2194 consecutive chest CT performed over a 7-week epidemic wave, we observed significant variations of CT predictive values whereas CT specificity appeared marginally affected.

0	Clinical and biochemical parameters of COVID-19 patients with prior or active dengue fever. Originated in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) has quickly spread worldwide, reaching countries that already faced other endemics and epidemics. In Brazil, such a concerning situation includes arboviruses, among which the dengue virus stands out. Here, we determined the rate of SARS-CoV-2/dengue virus co-infection in a total of 178 patients with COVID-19 symtoms admitted into a large public hospital of the Federal District of Brazil. Furthermore, we evaluated whether prior or active dengue virus infection influenced hematological, biochemical, and clinical parameters of such patients. One hundred and twelve (63%) individuals tested positive for COVID-19, of which 43 (38.4%) were co-infected with dengue virus, and 50 (44.6%) had antibodies indicative of previous dengue infection. Co-infected patients showed lower numbers of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, higher glucose rates, and a worse pulmonary condition. Of note, prior infections with dengue virus did not influence clinical parameters, but active dengue fever resulted in higher hospitalization rate. In conclusion, amid the current complex epidemiological scenario in Brazil, our data support the notion that SARS-CoV-2 and dengue co-infection affects an important percentage of COVID-19 patients and leads to worse clinical parameters, requiring greater attention from health authorities.

0	Open defecation and squat toilets, an overlooked risk of fecal transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens in developing communities. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has infected over 46 million people in 219 countries and territories. Following evidence of viral loadings and infectivity of feces of infected individuals, public health authorities have suggested to take precautions on the transmission of COVID-19 via fecal-associated routes. Recent discussions on fecal transmission of COVID-19 have mainly focused on municipal sewage. Yet, a widely neglected aspect in containing the virus is that a major part of the population in developing regions do not have access to private, clean sanitary facilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that open defecation and the prevalent use of squat toilets are additional risk factors in those communities. Here, we review fecal transmission of COVID-19, the practices of open defecation, and the resultant routes of transmission of fecal pathogens. Also, we highlight the open design of common squat toilets and the potential exposure to fecal droplets and residues. We observed that at least 20 countries reporting more than 10,000 confirmed infections have 5-26% of their population practicing open defecation. We illustrate the potential routes of transmission of COVID-19 and other fecal pathogens via human feces in communities practicing open defecation. Here, poor hand hygiene, contaminated shoes and objects, mechanical vectors, and outdoor human activities can all contribute to fecal transmission. Other risk factors include squat pans with lidless designs and open flushing mechanisms, in-cubicle open waste bins, and the lack of water-sealing U-traps in squat toilets.

0	Psychological Impacts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the First Nationwide Lockdown in Vietnam: An Internet-based Survey. BACKGROUND: The first nationwide lockdown due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been imposed in Vietnam between April 1 and 15, 2020. Nevertheless, there has been limited information on the impact of COVID-19 to society's psychological health., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological issues and identify the factors associated with the psychological impact of COVID-19 during the first nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam., METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. A self-administered, online survey was used to collect data and assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants from April 10 to 15, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were utilized to assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants during COVID-19 social distancing. The associated factors were explored by using regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 1,385 respondents completed the survey. There were 35.9%, 23.5%, 14.1%, and 22.3% who suffered from psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Those respondents who evaluated their physical health as average had higher IES-R score, DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress than those in good/very good health status (beta-coefficient regression (B) = 9.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 6.43 to 11.89), B = 5.85, 95% CI, 4.49 to 7.21, B = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.64 to 4.63, and B = 5.19, 95% CI, 3.83 to 6.56, respectively). Those who were in bad or very bad health condition suffered more severe depression, anxiety and stress (B = 9.57, 95% CI, 4.54 to 14.59, B = 7.24, 95% CI, 3.55 to 10.9, and B = 10.60, 95% CI, 5.56 to 15.65, respectively). Unemployment was more likely associated with depression and stress (B = 3.34, 95% CI, 1.68 to 5.01, and B = 2.34, 95% CI, 0.84 to 3.85). Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half (54.5%) expressed concern on their children aged below 18 years, which increased their IES-R score and DASS-21 stress score (B = 7.81, 95% CI, 4.98 to 10.64, and B = 1.75, 95% CI, 0.27 to 3.24, respectively). Majority (94.6%) were confident on the doctor's expertise in COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, which was positively associated with less distress caused by the outbreak (B = -7.84, 95% CI, -14.58 to -1.11)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the impacts on mental health of COVID-19 during the nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam. The study provides useful evidence for policy decision-makers to develop and implement interventions to mitigate these impacts., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	When helping hurts: COVID-19 critical incident involvement and resource depletion in health care workers. A focus on helping others is generally lauded, particularly in medicine, but in the context of a pandemic when health care professionals are facing increased risk, loss, and trauma, this focus can potentially be detrimental. In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

0	Design of a multi-epitope-based vaccine targeting M-protein of SARS-CoV2: an immunoinformatics approach. In the present study, one of the targets present on the envelopes of coronaviruses, membrane glycoprotein (M) was chosen for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine by Immunoinformatics approach. The B-cell and T-cell epitopes used for the construction of vaccine were antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic. An adjuvant, beta-defensin and PADRE sequence were included at the N-terminal end of the vaccine. All the epitopes were joined by linkers for decreasing the junctional immunogenicity. Various physicochemical parameters of the vaccine were evaluated. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the vaccine construct. The tertiary structure was further refined, and various parameters related to the refinement of the protein structure were validated by using different tools. Humoral immunity induced by B-cells relies upon the identification of antigenic determinants on the surface of the vaccine construct. In this regard, the vaccine construct was found to consist of several B-cell epitopes in its three-dimensional conformation. Molecular docking of the vaccine was carried out with TLR-3 receptor to study their binding and its strength. Further, protein-protein interactions in the docked complex were visualized using LigPlot+. Population coverage analysis had shown that the multi-epitope vaccine covers 94.06% of the global population. The vaccine construct was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (+). Immune simulation studies showed the induction of primary, secondary and tertiary immune responses marked by the increased levels of antibodies, INF-gamma, IL-2, TGF-beta, B- cells, CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Finally, the vaccine construct was able to elicit immune response as desired. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	false
0	Vaccination against seasonal influenza and socio-economic and environmental factors as determinants of the geographic variation of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the Italian elderly. BACKGROUND: A possible protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccination against the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been suggested., METHODS: We used publicly available data bases to explore the hypothesis as well as the effect of multiple social and environmental factors in the 20 Italian regions., RESULTS: Our results suggest that vaccination against seasonal influenza might beneficially impact on incidence and severity of the novel corona virus epidemic. Population density and vehicular traffic were also moderately associated with cumulative incidence of COVID-19. None of the other variables we considered showed an effect on cumulative incidence, case fatality rate or mortality from COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Extending influenza vaccination coverage particularly among the elderly, vulnerable individuals with specific chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and workers in other essential services, early in the upcoming 2020 influenza season, might help reduce the health impact of a second epidemic wave of COVID-19.

0	The Impact of Immunosuppression and Autoimmune Disease on Severe Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19. Immunosuppression (IS) and autoimmune disease (AD) are prevalent in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their impact on its clinical course is unknown. We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94-3.12; p = 0.081). Patients in this cohort also had higher median serum levels of interleukin-6 compared with IS-AD patients (98.2 vs 21.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0328) and NIS-NAD patients (29.1 pg/mL; p = 0.0057). In conclusion, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those receiving immunosuppressive treatment for an AD may have a reduced risk of developing severe ARDS.	false
0	Emerging Molecular Prospective of SARS-CoV-2: Feasible Nanotechnology Based Detection and Inhibition. The rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates how vulnerable it can make communities and is why it has attained the status of global pandemic. According to the estimation from Worldometer, the SARS-CoV-2 affected cases and deaths are exponentially increasing worldwide, marking the mortality rate as ~3.8% with no probability of its cessation till now. Despite massive attempts and races among scientific communities in search of proper therapeutic options, the termination of this breakneck outbreak of COVID-19 has still not been made possible. Therefore, this review highlights the diverse molecular events induced by a viral infection, such as autophagy, unfolded protein response (UPR), and inflammasome, illustrating the intracellular cascades regulating viral replication inside the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis are also emphasized in the review. Additionally, host's immune response associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the genetic and epigenetic changes, have been demonstrated, which altogether impart a better understanding of its epidemiology. Considering the drawbacks of available diagnostics and medications, herein we have presented the most sensitive nano-based biosensors for the rapid detection of viral components. Moreover, conceptualizing the viral-induced molecular changes inside its target cells, nano-based antiviral systems have also been proposed in this review.© Copyright © 2020 Patra, Kerry, Maurya, Panigrahi, Kumari and Rout.	false
0	Cytokines and COVID-19: friends or foes?. The cytokine storm following sepsis has been proven to be an important mechanism for triggering acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammation characterized by high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, secreted by immune effector cells. The cytokine storm also occurs in the recently emerged novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, cytokines which usually help the immune system to fight infections are potentially harmful in the course of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, avoiding or mitigating the cytokine storm may be a key treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	false

0	CON: COVID-19 will not result in increased antimicrobial resistance prevalence. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is affected by many factors, but too much of our focus has been on antimicrobial usage. The major factor that drives resistance rates globally is spread. The COVID-19 pandemic should lead to improved infection prevention and control practices, both in healthcare facilities and the community. COVID-19 will also have ongoing and profound effects on local, national and international travel. All these factors should lead to a decrease in the spread of resistant bacteria. So overall, COVID-19 should lead to a fall in resistance rates seen in many countries. For this debate we show why, overall, COVID-19 will not result in increased AMR prevalence. But globally, changes in AMR rates will not be uniform. In wealthier and developed countries, resistance rates will likely decrease, but in many other countries there are already too many factors associated with poor controls on the spread of bacteria and viruses (e.g. poor water and sanitation, poor public health, corrupt government, inadequate housing, etc.). In these countries, if economies and governance deteriorate further, we might see even more transmission of resistant bacteria. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Thymosin Alpha 1 Reduces the Mortality of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 by Restoration of Lymphocytopenia and Reversion of Exhausted T Cells. BACKGROUND: Thymosin alpha 1 (Talpha1) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years. However, clinical benefits and the mechanism of Talpha1 treatment for COVID-19 patients are still unclear. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe COVID-19 cases admitted to 2 hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to March 2020. The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients was measured by T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). The levels of T-cell exhaustion markers programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim-3) on CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULT(S): Compared with the untreated group, Talpha1 treatment significantly reduced the mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs 30.00%, P = .044). Talpha1 enhanced blood T-cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia. Under such conditions, Talpha1 also successfully restored CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell numbers in elderly patients. Meanwhile, Talpha1 reduced PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared with untreated cases. It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells were roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs. CONCLUSION(S): Talpha1 treatment significantly reduced mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation less than 400/muL or 650/muL, respectively, gained more benefits from Talpha1. Talpha1 reversed T-cell exhaustion and recovered immune reconstitution through promoting thymus output during severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

The literature has reported a higher prevalence of negative clinical outcomes due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in obese individuals. This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (gammaOz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the gammaOz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gammaOz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-gamma in the adipose tissue., METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar- fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar- fat diet + gammaOz (HSF + gammaOz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The gammaOz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-gamma gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis., RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-gamma underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The gammaOz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-gamma overexpression., CONCLUSION: Natural compounds as gammaOz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.

The aim of the investigation was to study the clinical course of COVID-19 in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and elucidate possible mechanisms of their mutual aggravation. Materials and Methods. The study included 64 patients with COVID-19; of them, 32 were with DM (main group) and 32 were DM-free (control group). The groups were formed according to the ""case-control"" principle. During hospitalization, the dynamics of clinical, glycemic, and coagulation parameters, markers of systemic inflammation, as well as kidney and liver functions were monitored and compared. Results. Among patients with DM, the course of viral pneumonia was more severe, as evidenced by a 2.2-fold higher number of people with extensive (>50%) lung damage (p=0.05), an increased risk of death according to the CURB-65 algorithm (1.3-fold, p=0.043), and a longer duration of insufficient blood oxygen saturation (p=0.0004). With the combination of COVID-19 and DM, hyperglycemia is persistent, without pronounced variability (MAGE - 1.5+/-0.6 mmol/L), the levels of C-reactive protein (p=0.028), creatinine (p=0.035), and fibrinogen (p=0.013) are higher, manifestations of hypercoagulability persist longer, including slower normalization of antithrombin III (p=0.012), fibrinogen (p=0.037), and D-dimer (p=0.035). Conclusion. The course of COVID-19 in patients with DM is associated with a high severity and extension of pneumonia, persistent decrease in oxygen supply, high hyperglycemia, accelerated renal dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and hypercoagulability.Copyright © 2020, Privolzhsky Research Medical University.

0	Diagnostic approaches and potential therapeutic options for coronavirus disease 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 and identified as a novel coronavirus. Due to its contagious nature, the virus spreads rapidly and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The global tally of COVID-19 was 28 million in early September 2020. The fears and stress associated with SARS-CoV-2 has demolished the socio-economic status worldwide. Researchers are trying to identify treatments, especially antiviral drugs and/or vaccines, that could potentially control the viral spread and manage the ongoing unprecedented global crisis. To date, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted on various antiviral drugs, and immunomodulators are being evaluated at various stages of COVID-19. This review aims to collect and summarize a list of drugs used to treat COVID-19, including dexamethasone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, tociluzimab, nitazoxanide and ivermectin. However, some of these drugs are not effective and their use has been suspended by WHO.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

However, none of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted so far have reached their primary endpoints. Herein we report that RCTs of CP disclose a high methodological variability in inclusion criteria, outcomes, appropriate selection of donors, dosage, concentration of neutralizing antibodies and times of transfusion. Therefore, at this time there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of CP as a treatment for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	An unusual presentation of COVID-19: Acute pancreatitis. Novel COVID-19 infectious disease typically presents with pulmonary symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, and fever. However, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized and drawn significant attention. We report an atypical case of acute pancreatitis in a patient with SARSCoV2 infection. CT scan of the abdomen showed findings suggestive of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis with a CT severity index was 3. HRCT chest revealed multifocal ground glass opacities in both lungs with a CORADS score of 5. Later, nasal swab for COVID RT-PCR tested positive. The patient was treated symptomatically with fluid replacement, optimization of electrolyte balance and oxygen supplementation. She had an uneventful recovery with gradual resolution of her abdominal and pulmonary symptoms. COVID-19 pathogenesis is believed to be mediated by the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor over the cell surface. ACE-2, which acts as a receptor for viral entry into host cells are highly expressed in pancreatic cells. All the reported cases of COVID-19 pancreatitis so far are known cases of COVID 19 pneumonia, developed acute pancreatitis or pancreatic injury in due course or during recovery of the illness. Ours is the first case to present with features of acute pancreatitis without any pulmonary symptoms, who turned out to be positive for COVID 19 during workup. Clinicians involved in the management of acute pancreatitis should be aware of its existence in the context of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to establish the real prevalence and clinical significance of pancreatic injury in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Covid-19: Its incidence and recovery among global population - A review. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease was first identified on december 2019 in Wuhan,the capital of China Hubei province and has since spread globally resulting in the ongoing 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic. Most recently,the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-COV)was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day which is an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infection detected in Wuhan,the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province which was first reported to the WHO country office in China,on dec 31,2019. Aim(s):To review the incidence and recovery of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak among the global population. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a literature review conducted using article sources from databases-Scopus and PubMed from september 2019 to April 2020. The articles are screened for data extraction and the characteristics of studies are tabulated. The collected data is analysed and the results are reported. Results and Conclusion(s): The findings of the review suggests that the recovery cases are less compared to active cases,because it is so contagious which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person transmits the virus is relatively high.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

0	Imaging Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic Highlights Socioeconomic Health Disparities. OBJECTIVE: The devastating impact from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights long-standing socioeconomic health disparities in the United States. The purpose of this study was to evaluate socioeconomic factors related to imaging utilization during the pandemic., METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive imaging examinations was performed from January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020, across all service locations (inpatient, emergency, outpatient). Patient level data were provided for socioeconomic factors (age, gender, race, insurance status, residential zip code). Residential zip code was used to assign median income level. The weekly total imaging volumes in 2020 and 2019 were plotted from January 1 to May 31 stratified by socioeconomic factors to demonstrate the trends during the pre-COVID-19 (January 1 to February 28) and post-COVID-19 (March 1 to May 31) periods. Independent-samples t tests were used to statistically compare the 2020 and 2019 socioeconomic groups., RESULTS: Compared with 2019, the 2020 total imaging volume in the post-COVID-19 period revealed statistically significant increased imaging utilization in patients who are aged 60 to 79 years (P = .0025), are male (P < .0001), are non-White (Black, Asian, other, unknown) (P < .05), are covered by Medicaid or uninsured (P < .05), and have income below $80,000 (P < .05). However, there was a significant decrease in imaging utilization among patients who are younger (<18 years old) (P < .0001), are female (P < .0001), are White (P = .0003), are commercially insured (P < .0001), and have income >=$80,000 (P < .05)., DISCUSSION: During the pandemic, there was a significant change in imaging utilization varying by socioeconomic factors, consistent with the known health disparities observed in the prevalence of COVID-19. These findings could have significant implications in directing utilization of resources during the pandemic and subsequent recovery. Copyright © 2020 American College of Radiology.

0	Therapeutic targeting of interleukin-6 for the treatment of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in China and has spread worldwide with a significant rate of infection. Considering the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, it is suggested that cytokine storms play a critical role in its pathogenesis, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no specific drug for preventing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by COVID-19. Indeed, interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been highlighted for its many biological functions, such as immune regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. Therapeutic blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway is expected to reduce the excessive immune reponse observed in COVID-19. Currently, the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab, have been adopted for preventing CRS during the progression of COVID-19, and remarkable beneficial effects were observed by using these humanized monoclonal antibodies. Based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we reviewed the biological mechanism of IL-6 blockade in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated its clinical applications.	false
0	Melatonin, aging, and COVID-19: Could melatonin be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment in the elderly?. The aim of this review is to summarize current studies on the relationship between melatonin and aging. Nowadays, age-related diseases come into prominence, and identifying age-related changes and developing proper therapeutic approaches are counted as some of the major issues regarding community health. Melatonin is the main hormone of the pineal gland. Melatonin is known to influence many biological processes in the body, including circadian rhythms, the immune system, and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions. Melatonin rhythms also reflect the biological process of aging. Aging is an extremely complex and multifactorial process. Melatonin levels decline considerably with aging and its decline is associated with several age-related diseases. Aging is closely associated with oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Free radical reactions initiated by the mitochondria constitute the inherent aging process. Melatonin plays a pivotal role in preventing age-related oxidative stress. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rates increase with chronic diseases and age, where melatonin levels decrease. For this reason, melatonin supplementation in elderly could be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, studies on the usage of melatonin in COVID-19 treatment are needed.Copyright © TUBITAK.	false
0	The Intersection between COVID-19, the Gene Family of ACE2 and Alzheimer's Disease. We reviewed factors that might influence COVID-19 outcomes (eg, neurological symptoms), including the link to Alzheimer's disease. Since the virus triggers COVID-19 infection through binding to ACE2, we focused on the ACE2 gene family, including ACE. Both ACE2 and ACE are involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In general, ACE causes inflammation and vasoconstriction, while ACE2 leads to anti-inflammation activity and vasodilation. The disturbed balance between these counter-regulatory pathways could influence susceptibility to COVID-19. Notably, dysregulation of the RAS-equilibrium contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Differences in the incidence and symptoms of COVID-19 in diverse populations could be attributed to variability in the human genome. For example, ACE and ACE2 variations could modify the outcome of COVID-19 in different populations. It would be important to conduct genome-wide studies to detect variants influencing COVID-19 presentation, with a special focus on variants affecting immune-related pathways and expression of RAS-related genes.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major threat to the health and prosperity of human life at present. It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes. Therefore, the question arises, ""Does COVID-19 infection alter the salivary components and composition leading to early transient symptoms of Ageusia and hypogeusia?"" This review shows association of the COVID-19 and Ageusia, in addition to the early viral infection of salivary glands and possible changes in salivary flow and content. Therefore, suggesting a potential association between early ageusia in COVID-19 infection and salivary compositional changes. Copyright Dental Investigation Society.

0	Advantages and disadvantages of RT- PCR in COVID 19. Coronavirus which is an irresistible sickness was spread overall pandemic. First events of obscure etiology in Wuhan, China. This distinguished a novel coronavirus now named as a SARS COV 2. It is secured by fat protein which is a solitary abandoned RNA genome. The infections are round or pleomorphic with wrapped particles.SARS-COV incites a huge scope starting in China and the new infection is by all accounts infectious and the COVs have become the significant pathogens of developing respiratory maladies. The indications of the beginning periods of the infection are vague. The death rates for cases all around stay between 1% to 2%. Rapid duplication of infections is additionally an entangled factor in identifying the ailment. Consequently the recognition of this sickness can be distinguished by different strategies like RT-PCR (Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction), CT (Computed Tomography) and so forth... RT-PCR is one among them. Detection of infection by RT-PCR in clinical examples offers the alternative of conclusion in the beginning periods of the ailment and its application incorporates genotyping, mutation detection. RT-PCR techniques during the initial hardly any long periods of ailment have been low and much better affectability is after day 6 of the ailment. RT- PCR technique which is found to be a standard method for diagnosing the positive cases. This helps in finding true negativity and rule out the serological positive cases. Thus, this review at the advantages and disadvantages of RT- PCR in COVID 19.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), a single-stranded RNA virus, was found to be the causal agent of the disease called coronavirus disease. During December 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology, which caused severe-acute respiratory distress. The disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Due to alarming levels of spread and severity, on the 11th of March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak as a global pandemic. As of September 14 2020, more than 29 million cases have been reported, with over 900,000 deaths globally. Since the outbreak, although not conclusive, discoveries have been made regarding the understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, clinical treatment, and prevention of the disease. SARS-COV-2 has been detected in saliva, respiratory fluids, blood, urine, and faeces. Findings are however controversial regarding its presence in the semen or the testis. Hence, this review aimed to further analyse the literature concerning (i) the effects of previously identified human coronaviruses on male fertility (ii) the impact of Covid-19 on male fertility and (iii) the implication for general health in terms of infection and transmission.

0	Human Inborn Errors of Immunity (HIEI): predominantly antibody deficiencies (PADs): if you suspect it, you can detect it. OBJECTIVE: This minireview gathers the scientific foundations of the literature on genetic errors in the development of the humoral immune system to help pediatricians suspect these defects., SOURCES: A systemic search using the PubMed MEDLINE database was performed for all Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PADs) described in the 2020 IUIS Expert Committee for PID classification system, combined with terms for hypogammaglobulinemia. Search terms for PADs were based on the listed names and affected genes as classified by the IUIS 2020. Abstracts of the results were reviewed to find relevant case series, review articles of PADs associated with infection, opportunistic infection, autoimmunity, cytopenias, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, neurological and respiratory diseases. References from relevant articles were further reviewed for additional references. Relevant findings were grouped in accordance with the IUIS 2020 classification system. Clinical and genetic features, if known, were described., DATA SYNTHESIS: PADs refer to impaired antibody production due to molecular defects intrinsic to B cells or a failure of interaction between B and T cells. The patients develop recurrent or chronic infection or respond to the antigens with dysregulation of the immune function, causing severe allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation, lymphoproliferation and malignancy. The diagnosis is a combined exercise of clinical and laboratory investigation similar to that performed by Bruton (1952). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the experience of XLA and CVID patients has been surprising. Variants in 39 genes were reported as causing PADs, but the clinical heterogeneity within each variant is not clear., CONCLUSION: Bruton (1952) used clinical expertise and protein electrophoresis to identify XLA. The IUIS (2020) committee used immunoglobulins and B lymphocyte to characterize PADs. Pediatricians should suspect it to detect it and prevent morbidities that can have an astonishing and irreversible impact on the child's life. Copyright © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Many factors were under discussion among public health experts for the exorbitant mortality rate in Italy than other countries. A coordinated global response was desperately needed to prepare health systems to meet this unprecedented challenge in Italy. This review illustrates predictions, chronic comorbidities, effects of COVID 19 on Italian health system. Covid disease affecting the elderly population with co-morbidities, the same was associated in the mortality rate among elder population in Italy in a greater rate. The mortality rate in Italy was also higher due to the asymptomatic cases not being tested and isolated with initial screening. The most serious outcome of COVID 19 pneumonia was recorded among the population in Italy. Exhausted number of ICU's beds, ventilators and respirators revealed their un-preparedness for the covid-19 pandemic. This review thus focuses on the various factors to be considered in future pandemics by analyzing the covid - 19 pandemic in Italy.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: challenges, risks, and the way forward. The COVID-19 pandemic mandates the development of a safe and effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. This review analyzes the complexities, challenges, and other vital issues associated with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A brief review of the immune responses (innate, antibody, and T-cell) to SARS-CoV-2, including immune targets, correlates of protection, and duration of immunity is presented. Approaches to vaccine development including different vaccine platforms, critical attributes of novel vaccine candidates, the status of the ongoing clinical trials, and the ways to speed up vaccine development are also reviewed. Despite a historical average success rate of only 6%, and a usual gestation period of 10-12 years for the development of a new vaccine, the world is on the verge of developing COVID-19 vaccines in an extraordinary short time span.	false

0	"COVID-19: In the Eye of the Cytokine Storm. The dysregulated release of cytokines has been identified as one of the key factors behind poorer outcomes in COVID-19. This ""cytokine storm"" produces an excessive inflammatory and immune response, especially in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS), pulmonary edema and multi-organ failure. Alleviating this inflammatory state is crucial to improve prognosis. Pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with comorbidities. In these situations, an overactive, untreated immune response can be deadly, suggesting that mortality in COVID-19 cases is likely due to this virally driven hyperinflammation. Administering immunomodulators has not yielded conclusive improvements in other pathologies characterized by dysregulated inflammation such as sepsis, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The success of these drugs at reducing COVID-19-driven inflammation is still anecdotal and comes with serious risks. It is also imperative to screen the elderly for risk factors that predispose them to severe COVID-19. Immunosenescence and comorbidities should be taken into consideration. In this review, we summarize the latest data available about the role of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease severity as well as potential therapeutic approaches to ameliorate it. We also examine the role of inflammation in other diseases and conditions often comorbid with COVID-19, such as aging, sepsis, and pulmonary disorders. Finally, we identify gaps in our knowledge and suggest priorities for future research aimed at stratifying patients according to risk as well as personalizing therapies in the context of COVID19-driven hyperinflammation.© Copyright © 2020 de la Rica, Borges and Gonzalez-Freire."	false

0	A Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label Trial of Early versus Late Favipiravir Therapy in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. Favipiravir is an oral broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is approved for treatment of influenza in Japan. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62). Of 30 patients who had a fever (>=37.5degreeC) on day 1, times to defervescence were 2.1days and 3.2days in the early and late treatment groups (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 4.35). During therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not significantly improve viral clearance as measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to defervescence. Neither disease progression nor death occurred in any of the patients in either treatment group during the 28-day participation.

0	Antibody-guided structure-based vaccines. The vaccine field is pursuing diverse approaches to translate the molecular insights from analyses of effective antibodies and their targeted epitopes into immunogens capable of eliciting protective immune responses. Here we review current antibody-guided strategies including conformation-based, epitope-based, and lineage-based vaccine approaches, which are yielding promising vaccine candidates now being evaluated in clinical trials. We summarize directions being employed by the field, including the use of sequencing technologies to monitor and track developing immune responses for understanding and improving antibody-based immunity. We review opportunities and challenges to transform powerful new discoveries into safe and effective vaccines, which are encapsulated by vaccine efforts against a variety of pathogens including HIV-1, influenza A virus, malaria parasites, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this review summarizes the extensive progress that has been made to realize antibody-guided structure-based vaccines, the considerable challenges faced, and the opportunities afforded by recently developed molecular approaches to vaccine development.

0	Orthopaedic surgery in a time of COVID-19: Using a low prevalence COVID-19 trauma surgery model to guide a safe return to elective surgery. Aims: Elective surgery has been severely curtailed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little evidence to guide surgeons in assessing what processes should be put in place to restart elective surgery safely in a time of endemic COVID-19 in the community., Methods: We used data from a stand-alone hospital admitting and operating on 91 trauma patients. All patients were screened on admission and 100% of patients have been followed-up after discharge to assess outcome., Results: Overall, 87 (96%) patients remained symptom-free and recovered well following surgery. Four (4%) patients developed symptoms of COVID-19, with polymerase chain reaction ribonucleiuc acid (PCR-RNA) testing confirming infection., Conclusion: Based on our findings, we propose that if careful cohorting and screening is carried out in a stand-alone cold operating site, it is reasonable to resume elective operating, in a time of endemic but low community prevalence of SAR-Cov2.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:229-235.

0	"A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing. Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic ""socially distant"" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight ""window of opportunity"" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.

0	Immunoglobulin Deficiency as an Indicator of Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19. Despite the pandemic status of COVID-19, there is limited information about host risk factors and treatment beyond supportive care. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) could be a potential treatment target. Our aim was to determine the incidence of IgG deficiency and associated risk factors in a cohort of 62 critical ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two German ICUs (72.6% male, median age: 61 years). 13 (21.0%) of the patients displayed IgG deficiency (IgG <7 g/L) at baseline (predominant for the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses). IgG-deficient patients had worse measures of clinical disease severity than those with normal IgG levels (shorter duration from disease onset to ICU admission, lower ratio of PaO2 to FiO2, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher levels of ferritin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and serum creatinine). IgG-deficient patients were also more likely to have sustained lower levels of lymphocyte counts and higher levels of ferritin throughout the hospital stay. Furthermore, IgG-deficient patients compared to those with normal IgG levels displayed higher rates of acute kidney injury (76.9% vs. 26.5%; p=0.005) and death (46.2% vs. 14.3%; p=0.012), longer ICU (28 [6-48] vs. 12 [3-18] days; p=0.012) and hospital length of stay (30 [22-50] vs. 18 [9-24] days; p=0.004). Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing odds of 90-day overall mortality associated with IgG-deficiency (OR 12.8, 95% CI 1.5-108.4; p=0.019). IgG deficiency might be common in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and warrants investigation as both a marker of disease severity as well as a potential therapeutic target.	false
0	Lockdown, relaxation, and acme period in COVID-19: A study of disease dynamics in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early acme around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the acme levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the acme occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.	false
0	Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in the general population: systematic review. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are varied in the general population. This study aimed to systematize the literature regarding clinical manifestations of patients with confirmed COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. A total of 8070 scientific productions were found in the databases. Among the studies, 184 met the initial inclusion criteria, with a total of 114,046 patients. After complete reading, 32 studies that did not report clinical manifestations were excluded. The 152 publications finally included a total of 41,409 individuals from at least 23 countries and 26 different clinical manifestations were reported. In percentage terms, 6 symptoms had a general prevalence greater than or equal to 25%, namely, fever (58.66%), cough (54.52%), dyspnea (30.82%), malaise (29.75%), fatigue (28.16%) and sputum/secretion (25.33%). Neurological symptoms (20.82%), dermatological manifestations (20.45%), anorexia (20.26%), myalgia (16.9%), sneezing (14.71%), sore throat (14.41%), rhinitis (14.29%), goosebumps (13.49%), headache (12.17%), chest pain (11.49%) and diarrhea (9.59%) were other common symptoms. Only one study reported dermatological manifestations. The least frequent sign/symptom was hemoptysis (1.65%). In studies with more than 100 patients, the 3 main symptoms were fever (57.93%), cough (54.21%), and dyspnea (30.64%). Dermatological manifestations do not appear among the main symptoms. The identification of all clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is essential for an early diagnosis and the adoption of preventive measures.	false
0	Pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19: a prevalence study in a tertiary hospital. INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, predominantly affects the respiratory tract, and a growing number of publications report the predisposition of patients with COVID-19 to develop thrombotic phenomena., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier., RESULTS: We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of D-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without. Copyright © 2020 SERAM.

0	Prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress among populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and Psychological distress (PD) related to COVID-19 among affected populations., METHODS: We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Random-effects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted., RESULTS: A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57). Between-group differences were only found in HCWs (z=2.69, p < 0.05) who had a higher prevalence of insomnia than others., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19 are equally high across affected countries, and across gender. However, reports of insomnia are significantly higher among HCWs than the general population. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Takotsubo Syndrome: Cardiotoxic Stress in the COVID Era. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy and broken heart syndrome, is a neurocardiac condition that is among the most dramatic manifestations of psychosomatic disorders. This paper is based on a systematic review of TTS and stress cardiomyopathy using a PubMed literature search. Typically, an episode of severe emotional or physical stress precipitates regions of left ventricular hypokinesis or akinesis, which are not aligned with a coronary artery distribution and are out of proportion to the modest troponin leak. A classic patient with TTS is described; one who had chest pain and dyspnea while watching an anxiety-provoking evening news program on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An increase in the incidence of TTS appears to be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the TTS incidence rising 4.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic even in individuals without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Takotsubo syndrome is often mistaken for acute coronary syndrome because they both typically present with chest pain, electrocardiographic changes suggesting myocardial injury/ischemia, and troponin elevations. Recent studies report that the prognosis for TTS is similar to that for acute myocardial infarction. This review is an update on the mechanisms underlying TTS, its diagnosis, and its optimal management. Copyright © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

0	Acute Myocarditis Related to COVID-19: Comparison to SARS and MERS. Myocardial involvement has been described during previous SARS and MERS outbreaks. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening multi-system disease. Heart involvement most commonly occurs during severe COVID-19 infection. Myocardial injury, based on elevated levels of myocardial enzymes, has been noted in up to 30% of patients with COVID-19 infection and could be a marker for worse prognosis. A few cases of possible myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 have been described, providing variable degree of evidence of direct myocardial involvement. We reviewed in detail those cases in comparison to relevant literature on SARS and MERS and attempted to draw initial conclusions in regard to clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis.

0	Circulating Markers of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Are of Prognostic Value in Patients With COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, but emerging evidence suggest that excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a key role in COVID-19 disease progression. Here, we evaluate if circulating markers of NETs are associated with COVID-19 disease severity and clinical outcome, as well as to markers of inflammation and in vivo coagulation and fibrinolysis. Approach and Results: One hundred six patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe disease were enrolled shortly after hospital admission and followed for 4 months. Acute and convalescent plasma samples as well as plasma samples from 30 healthy individuals were assessed for markers of NET formation: citrullinated histone H3, cell-free DNA, NE (neutrophil elastase). We found that plasma levels of NET markers were all elevated in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls, were associated with respiratory support requirement and short-term mortality, and declined to those found in healthy individuals 4 months post-infection. Levels of the NET markers also correlated with white blood cells, neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines, and C-reactive protein, as well as to markers of in vivo coagulation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial damage., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a role of NETs in COVID-19 disease progression, implicating their contribution to an immunothrombotic state. Further, we observed an association between circulating markers of NET formation and clinical outcome, demonstrating a potential role of NET markers in clinical decision-making, as well as for NETs as targets for novel therapeutic interventions in COVID-19., REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04402944, NCT04541979, NCT04445285, NCT04432987, NCT04402970.	false
0	Storm at the Time of Corona: A Glimpse at the Current Understanding and Therapeutic Opportunities of the SARS-CoV-2 Cytokine Storm. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to severe disease in some cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. This severe phenotype seems to be associated with a cytokine storm and immune dysregulation. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia, and decreased levels of regulatory T cells are some of the immunological features that are seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2. As the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by both viral virulence and dysregulated inflammatory response, a combination therapy approach using antiviral drugs plus anti-inflammatory treatments, such as corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies against the IL-6 and IL-1beta pathways, and JAK inhibitors are under clinical trials.

0	Incidence of Maxillofacial Trauma Amid COVID-19: A Comparative Study. Introduction: Pandemic caused by novel coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation of lockdown in India. This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cases of maxillofacial trauma and its etiologic variation by comparing it with the previous year archived data., Materials and Methods: Patients with maxillofacial fracture visiting during the lockdown period (Phase) were compared to the patient's record during the same time period in the year 2019 (Control). They were subcategorised based on the etiology of trauma, i.e., road traffic accident (RTA), self-fall, physical assault and animal attacks. Age and gender variations were also assessed. Degree of significance was calculated using t test and p value obtained., Result: Mean age of trauma patients during lockdown and control period was 32.66 and 27.93 years, respectively. Number of cases of overall trauma had significantly decreased. Cases of RTA and self-fall were 22 and 4 in lockdown compared to 135 and 16 during control phase. Cases of physical assault increased by 50%, i.e., from 9 to 6 on comparison of both the phases. Animal attack maxillofacial injuries were 2 in each group., Conclusion: RTA and subsequent drop in numbers of maxillofacial trauma can be shown as the benefit of lockdown nonetheless on the other side increase in number of physical assaults also shows how isolation and restrictions have psychological negative impact on society.

0	Hypothesis: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a promising treatment option for COVID-19. No definitive treatment for COVID-19 exists although promising results have been reported with remdesivir and glucocorticoids. Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.	false
0	THE IMPACT OF SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION ON THE SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF COLORECTAL CANCER: LESSONS LEARNED FROM A MULTICENTER STUDY IN SPAIN. The aim of the study was to analyze the management of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) patients diagnosed with CRC or undergoing elective surgery during the period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A multicenter ambispective analysis was performed in nine centers in Spain during a 4-month period. Data were collected from every patient, including changes in treatments, referrals or delays in surgeries, changes in surgical approaches, postoperative outcomes and perioperative SARS-CoV-2 status. The hospital's response to the outbreak and available resources were categorized, and outcomes were divided into periods based on the timeline of the pandemic. A total of 301 patients were included by the study centers and 259 (86%) underwent surgery. Five hospitals went into phase III during the peak of incidence period, one remained in phase II and three in phase I. More than 60% of patients suffered some form of change: 48% referrals, 39% delays, 4% of rectal cancer patients had a prolonged interval to surgery and 5% underwent neoadjuvant treatment. At the time of study closure, 3% did not undergo surgery. More than 85% of the patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 9 patients (3%) developed postoperative pneumonia, three of them had confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The observed surgical complications and mortality rates were similar as expected in a usual situation. The present multicenter study shows different patterns of response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and collateral effects in managing CRC patients. Knowing these patterns could be useful for planning future changes in surgical departments in preparation for new outbreaks.	false
0	Isolation Considered Epidemiological Model for the Prediction of COVID-19 Trend in Tokyo, Japan: Numerical Study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently poses a global public health threat. Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model predicts susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered /deaths) cases and has been widely used but its applicability is limited often to an early phase of epidemic in the case of a large collective population. Full numerical simulation of entire period from beginning till end-point would be helpful in understanding COVID-19 trends with in-patient and infectious at large separately and also in preparing beds and develop quarantine strategies., OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop an isolation considered epidemiological model to simulate a whole trend of the first epidemic in Tokyo and allow to count in-patient and those of infectious at large separately. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equation i.e. effective reproductive number and the final size equation., METHODS: Time-series SARS-COV-2 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo and antibody test conducted by Japan Government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on discrete delay differential equation (ATLM) was introduced. The model can predict trends of in-patient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, in-patient, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model., RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting the present ATLM gave 20% less infectious cases in field than that of standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that time lag T from infected till detected and isolated is 14 days. Based on this, adequate vaccine ratio to avoid outbreak was evaluated 57% of population. The date of release of a statement of emergency was 23rd May was assessed. Taking into consideration of infectious cases in field, 30th May should have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with shorter time lag of T=7 and larger transmission rate alpha=1.43alpha0 suggest that infectious at large should reduce to by half and in-patient be much the same of those of the 1st wave of SARS-COV-2 epidemic while public health intervention is applied to enhance social contact by 43% ., CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-COV-2 data for Tokyo. Simulation agreed with data from beginning to endemic. Shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreak without rigorous public health intervention and control., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	A retrospective study assessing the characteristics of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and donations. BACKGROUND: Although a large number of trials are currently investigating the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) in critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is a paucity of ongoing and published studies evaluating the CP donors' side. This retrospective study reports the first Italian experience on CP donors' selection and donations., METHODS: Patients aged 18-68 years who had recovered from COVID-19 at least two weeks previously were recruited from March 18, to June 30, 2020 in a study protocol at the Italian hospitals of Pavia and Mantova., RESULTS: During the study period, 494/512 donors recruited were judged eligible and underwent 504 plasmapheresis procedures. Eighty-five percent (437/512) of the CP donors were males. The average time between symptom recovery and CP donation was 36.6 (+/-20.0) days. Four hundred and eighty-eight plasmapheresis procedures (96.8%) were concluded and each unit was divided into two subunits (total 976) with an average volume of 316.2 (+/-22.7) mL. Ninety-three percent (460/494) of CP donors at the time of plasma donation had a neutralizing IgG titer >=1:80. Plasmapheresis-related adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% (13/504) of cases; all the reactions were mild and none required therapeutic intervention. Donors' age and COVID-19 severity were positively associated with greater antibody responses., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a pilot CP program conducted in Italy. The identification of factors (i.e., age and severity of COVID-19) positively associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers at the time of donation may help to optimize the selection of CP donors.

0	Risk of COVID-19 Transmission during Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. COVID-19 is a viral illness caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is highly contagious virus with human-to-human transmission being primarily attributed to direct contact or air droplets. It is highly infectious and contagious due to high-viable viral loads in the upper respiratory tract secretions of infected patients and also similar viral load being detected in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The virus stability characteristics and modes of transmission via fomites and air droplets make gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy a high-risk procedure for COVID-19 transmission. This review discusses the currently available literature on risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during GI endoscopy.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Spread of a neurotropic coronavirus to spinal cord white matter via neurons and astrocytes. Mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) causes a chronic encephalomyelitis in susceptible mice, with histological evidence of demyelination in the spinal cord. After intranasal inoculation, virus spreads retrogradely to several brain structures along neuroanatomic projections to the main olfactory bulb. In the absence of experimental intervention, mice become moribund before the spinal cord is infected. In this study, infusions of anti-MHV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were administered to protect mice from the MHV-JHM-induced acute encephalitis and to allow survival until virus spread to the spinal cord. Under these conditions, virus was observed to enter specific layers (primarily laminae V to VII) in the gray matter of the upper spinal cord, consistent with transneuronal spread. While the brain structures which are the sources for virus spread to the spinal cord cannot be determined with certainty, the ventral reticular nucleus is likely to be important since it is consistently and extensively labeled in all mice and receives projections from subsequently infected areas of the spinal cord. After initial entry into the gray matter, virus rapidly spread to the white matter of the spinal cord. During the early stages of this process, extensive infection of astrocytes was noted, suggesting that cell-to-cell spread via these glial cells is an important part of this process. Reports from other laboratories using cultured cells strongly suggested that astrocytes serve as important regulators of oligodendrocyte function and, by extrapolation, have a major role in vivo in the processes of both demyelination and remyelination. Thus, our results not only outline the probable pathway used by MHV-JHM to infect the white matter of the spinal cord but also, with the assumption that infection of astrocytes leads to subsequent dysfunction, raise the possibility that infection of these cells contributes to the demyelinating process.	false
0	Change in trauma patterns in hilly areas of northern india during nationwide lockdown: A cross-sectional study. Introduction: The countries all over the world are experiencing COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to a change in the operational guidelines in all trauma centres. Lockdown, limiting vehicle traffic, has affected trauma patterns everywhere. Aim(s): To study the effect of lockdown on orthopaedic trauma in hilly areas of Northern India. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional retrospectively study collected the data of patients admitted in the emergency trauma ward like age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture type, number of emergency admissions, and number of surgeries pertaining to the complete lockdown period (25th March to 3rd May 2020 i.e., 40 days) at our hospital situated in the hilly areas of North India. This was compared with the trauma cases dealt during the same time period last year (2019). Result(s): More than 50% decrease in the outpatient load did not parallel to decrease in admissions in emergency department (164 in 2019 vs 169 in 2020). However, operated trauma cases did decline from 62 in 2019 to 51 in 2020. Some injuries like fracture proximal tibia, cut injuries of hand with sharp object increased while incidence of fragility fractures has remained the same. Conclusion(s): The trauma pattern in and around the hilly places in our area of Northern India portrays a unique picture where one does not see a foreseeable decline in trauma despite the lockdown. With the lockdown in effect, some patterns have emerged which may prove to be useful adjuncts in our efforts to improve public health and the trauma burden.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

0	Emerging diagnostic tools for detection of COVID-19 and perspective. The COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken a great toll of life affecting lakhs of people around the globe. It was detected initially in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly to more than 208 countries to date. A range of molecular and immunoassay-based techniques ranging from central laboratory testing to point-of-care tests is urgently needed for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. Intensive research is going on for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of COVID 19 using varied approach. Hence, this review will focus on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and recent progress of different detection tool for the detection of COVID-19. This review will also stimulate academics and researcher to update their current technology. Additionally, we also state about the future revolving around the detection of the novel coronavirus. Lately, the way ahead for better management are also put forward.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false

0	Periodontal tissues are targets for Sars-Cov-2: a post-mortem study. Background: The ability of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to spread is one of the determinants of the COVID-19 pandemic status. Until June 2020, global COVID-19 cases surpassed 10 million. Asymptomatic patients, with no respiratory impairment, are believed to be responsible for more than 80% of the transmission. Other viruses have been consistently detected in periodontal tissues. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissue. Method(s): We conducted video-endoscope minimally invasive post-mortem biopsy in seven fatal cases of COVID-19, using a regular endoscope video system associated with a smartphone to locate periodontal tissue. We analyzed the samples using RT-PCR, to identify the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and histopathological analysis. Result(s): The seven studied autopsies with positive laboratory tests for COVID-19 included 57.14% of female patients at the average age of 47.4 (range 8 to 74). In five cases, periodontal tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). Histopathologic analyses showed morphologic alterations in the keratinocytes of the junctional epithelium, a vacuolization of the cytoplasm and nucleus and nuclear pleomorphism. Conclusion(s): We presented a biomolecular analysis obtained from minimally invasive autopsies. This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissue in COVID-19 positive patients.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Obesity and COVID-19 in Latin America: A tragedy of two pandemics-Official document of the Latin American Federation of Obesity Societies. In May 2020, Latin America became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, a region already afflicted by social disparities, poor healthcare access, inadequate nutrition and a large prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases. Obesity and its comorbidities are increasingly prevalent in Latin America, with a more rapid growth in individuals with lower income, and currently a disease associated with COVID-19 severity, complications and death. In this document, the Latin American Association of Obesity Societies and collaborators present a review of the burden of two pandemics in Latin America, discuss possible mechanisms that explain their relationship with each other and provide public health and individual recommendations, as well as questions for future studies.

0	Retinal changes in COVID-19 hospitalized cases. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the retinas of severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients during their hospital stay, at varying time points after symptoms onset. This was a case series observed during May 2020 in two referral centers for COVID-19 treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 47 eyes from 25 hospitalized patients with severe or critical confirmed illness were evaluated. A handheld retinal camera was used to acquire bilateral fundus images at several time points after symptoms onset. Electronic health records were retrospectively analyzed and clinical data collected. Severe and critical diseases were noticed in 52% (13/25) and 48% (12/25) of enrolled patients, respectively. Retinal changes were present in 12% (3/25) of patients: a 35 year-old male demonstrated bilateral nerve fiber layer infarcts and microhemorrhages in the papillomacular bundle, but required mechanical ventilation and developed severe anemia and systemic hypotension, acute kidney injury and neurologic symptoms during the course of the disease (critical illness); a 56 year-old male, who required full enoxaparin anticoagulation due to particularly elevated D-dimer (>5.0 mcg/mL), demonstrated unilateral and isolated flame-shaped hemorrhages; and a 49 year-old hypertensive male showed bilateral and discrete retinal dot and blot microhemorrhages. The other 22 patients evaluated did not demonstrate convincing retinal changes upon examination. There was no correlation between disease severity and admission serum levels of CRP, D-dimer and ferritin. This was the first study to show that vascular retinal changes may be present in not insignificant numbers of severe or critical COVID-19 inpatients. These retinal changes, only seen after morbid developments, were likely secondary to clinical intercurrences or comorbidities instead of a direct damage by SARS-CoV-2, and may be important and easily accessible outcome measures of therapeutic interventions and sentinels of neurologic and systemic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Cutting Edge: Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Humans Is Defined by a Shift in the Serum Lipidome, Resulting in Dysregulation of Eicosanoid Immune Mediators. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 20 million people worldwide, with mortality exceeding 800,000 patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome, including immunomodulatory eicosanoid and docosanoid lipid mediators (LMs). We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450. Given the important immune-regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into an immuno-lipidomic imbalance in severe COVID-19.

0	The risk for severe COVID 19 in patients with autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases: First wave lessons. Data regarding the risk for severe COVID19 in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases are scarce. To estimate the risk of those patients to develop a more severe COVID19 infection All active patients and those with dermatologic and/or rheumatologic autoimmune/inflammatory diseases were identified in a single tertiary center. The charts of those tested positive for COVID19 between March 1st and May 31st, 2020 reviewed including demographics, co-morbidities and medications. COVID19 outcome of those with dermatologic and/or rheumatologic autoimmune/inflammatory diseases were compared to COVID19 infected matched controls without an autoimmune/inflammatory background. Overall, 974 of 381 268 active patients were tested positive for COVID19, including 35 out of 13 225 with dermatologic and/or rheumatologic autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. No statistically significant difference in severity of COVID19 infection or mortality rate was found. The rate of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe/critical and fatal COVID19 infection was 11.4%, 37.1%, 22.8%, 11.4% and 17.1% respectively for the patients with autoimmune diseases and 17.8%, 45.8%, 10.9%, 6.8% and 18.4% respectively for the controls . Patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases seem not to develop a more severe COVID19 infection than controls. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	"Testing IgG antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient and necessary for COVID-19 diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic and the fast global spread of the disease resulted in unprecedented decline in world trade and travel. A critical priority is, therefore, to quickly develop serological diagnostic capacity and identify individuals with past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In this study serum samples obtained from 309 persons infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 324 of healthy, uninfected individuals as well as serum from 7 COVID-19 patients with 4-7 samples each ranging between 1-92 days post first positive PCR were tested by an ""in house"" ELISA which detects IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity of 47%, 80% and 88% and specificity of 100%, 98% and 98% in detection of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively, were observed. IgG antibody levels against the RBD were demonstrated to be up regulated between 1-7 days after COVID-19 detection, earlier than both IgM and IgA antibodies. Study of the antibody kinetics of seven COVID 19 patients revealed that while IgG levels are high and maintained for at least 3 months, IgM and IgA levels decline after a 35-50 days following infection. Altogether, these results highlight the usefulness of the RBD based ELISA, which is both easy and cheap to prepare, to identify COVID-19 patients even at the acute phase. Most importantly our results demonstrate that measuring IgG levels alone is both sufficient and necessary to diagnose past exposure to SARS-CoV-2."	false
0	A brief review of the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus disease. Introduction: It has been demonstrated experimentally that the coronavirus can enter the central nervous system through olfactory nerves and can even reach medulla. Neurological manifestations are observed more frequently in patients with coronavirus disease., Main text: The aim of the review is to seek evidence for infection of the nervous system by the human coronavirus and study the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus and its treatment. A search was done in PubMed, Google Scholar, CrossRef, and Scopus. There is evidence for the coronavirus infection of the nervous system from experimental studies, autopsy reports, and clinical studies. The virus can damage the nervous system either by direct viral damage to the neural cells or by immunopathology. Cerebral edema, neuronal degeneration, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, polyneuritis, toxic encephalopathy, and stroke can occur. The coronavirus has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction technique in infected patients. The abnormalities of the coagulation system increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Chloroquine analogs, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and immunoglobulin have been shown to be useful for the treatment., Conclusion: There is substantial evidence for infection of the nervous system by the different strains of the human coronavirus. The coronavirus enters the nervous system either by the blood or from the olfactory nerves. The neurological diseases correlate with the severity of the coronavirus disease. The treatment is mainly supportive. The reports of patients with encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis show slow recovery. But a stroke has a high mortality.

0	Feasibility of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for covid-19: A mini review. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 carry the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which involves multiple systems and organs with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as the most common complication, largely due to cytokine storms or dysregulated immunity. As such, there are many severe patients with complications such as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), who have a high fatality rate. Neither specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs nor vaccines exist currently. Current treatment relies mainly on self-recovery through patients' immune function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a kind of multipotent tissue stem cells, which have powerful anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, inhibiting the cytokine storms. In addition, MSCs have a strong ability to repair tissue damage and reduce the risk of severe complications such as acute lung injury and ARDS, and hopefully, reduce the fatality rate in these patients. There are several clinical types of research completed for treating COVID-19 with MSCs, all reporting restoration of T cells and clinical safety. Here we discuss the clinical prospect and conclude the therapeutic effects and potential mechanism for MSCs in treating COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.	false

0	A commentary revisiting the viral hypothesis of schizophrenia: Onset of a schizophreniform disorder subsequent to SARS CoV-2 infection. The viral hypothesis for schizophrenia has persisted for decades, initially supported by observed increases in psychoses subsequent to the influenza pandemic of the early twentieth century, and then later by evidence of elevated viral antibody titres particularly in schizophrenia patient populations. Several research studies have also focused on maternal infections during the second trimester of pregnancy and their long-term effects on fetal brain development, ultimately leading to schizophrenia. No specific virus has been implicated although a handful have received increasing attention. The current pandemic spreading the SARS CoV-2 corona virus world-wide is now showing anecdotal evidence of psychoses newly developing post viral exposure, implicating neuronal inflammation in crucial areas of the brain that could initiate psychotic symptoms. Time will tell if epidemiological data will, similar to the 1918 influenza pandemic, show that schizophrenia spectrum disorders increase after serious viral infections. Copyright © 2020.

0	Intra-host non-synonymous diversity at a neutralizing antibody epitope of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain. Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 has evolved rapidly into several genetic clusters. However, data on mutations during the course of infection are scarce. This study aims to determine viral genome diversity in serial samples of COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Targeted deep sequencing of the spike gene was performed on serial respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Sanger sequencing was then performed to confirm the single nucleotide polymorphisms. Result(s): A total of 28 serial respiratory specimens from 12 patients were successfully sequenced using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. A 75-year-old patient with severe disease had a mutation, G22017T, identified in the second specimen. The frequency of G22017T increased from <=5% (nanopore: 3.8%; Illumina: 5%) from the first respiratory tract specimen (sputum) to >=60% (nanopore: 67.7%; Illumina: 60.4%) in the second specimen (saliva; collected 2 days after the first specimen). The difference in G22017T frequency was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing. G22017T corresponds to W152L amino acid mutation in the spike protein which was only found in <0.03% of the sequences deposited into a public database. Spike amino acid residue 152 is located within the N-terminal domain, which mediates the binding of a neutralizing antibody. Discussion(s): A spike protein amino acid mutation W152L located within a neutralizing epitope has appeared naturally in a patient. Our study demonstrated that monitoring of serial specimens is important in identifying hotspots of mutations, especially those occurring at neutralizing epitopes which may affect the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false
0	Factors associated with acute cardiac injury and their effects on mortality in patients with COVID-19. To determine the incidence of acute cardiac injury (ACI), the factors associated with ACI and the in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe patients. All consecutive in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during February 1 and March 29, 2020 were included. The demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Univariate and Firth logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with ACI and in-hospital mortality, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative in-hospital mortality. Among 1031 patients included, 215 (20.7%) had ACI and 501 (48.6%) were severe cases. Overall, 165 patients died; all were from the severe group, and 131 (79.39%) had ACI. ACI (OR = 2.34, P = 0.009), male gender (OR = 2.58, P = 0.001), oximeter oxygen saturation (OR = 0.90, P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 3.26, P < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR = 8.59, P < 0.001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (OR = 3.29, P = 0.016), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (OR = 2.94, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for the in-hospital mortality in severe patients. The mortality was significantly increased among severe patients with elevated hs-CRP, IL-6, hs-cTnI, and/or NT-proBNP. Moreover, the mortality was significantly higher in patients with elevation of both hs-cTnI and NT proBNP than in those with elevation of either of them. ACI develops in a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19, and is associated with the disease severity and in-hospital mortality. A combination of hs-cTnI and NT-proBNP is valuable in predicting the mortality.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 and cardiac arrhythmias. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a very contagious virus, has led to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The clinical manifestations of this virus in humans vary widely, from asymptomatic to severe, with diverse symptomatology and even death. The substantial transmission from asymptomatic people has facilitated the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, hampering public health initiatives to identify and isolate infected people during the pre-symptomatic contagious period. COVID-19 is associated with cardiac complications that can progress from mild to life-threatening. The aim of this article is to analyse the present knowledge of COVID-19 and cardiac involvement, the development of arrhythmia risk and its treatment.Copyright © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2020	false
0	Update on the implementation of new recommendations for the use of respiratory filters at Mulhouse hospital. Introduction: Facing the COVID-19 epidemic and its array of tensions/disruptions of supply and the need to avoid the spread of the disease, recommendations for the use of antibacterial/anti-viral filters and heat +/- moisture exchangers (HMEs) on the inspiratory and expiratory circuits of ventilators were issued by a multi-disciplinary working group. A few weeks after the initiation of the new security procedures during the COVID-19 epidemic, the medical devices department of the pharmacy began to be requested by various ventilator users departments for non-conformity and/or non-compatibility of the filters issued to them. Objective(s): An investigation was carried out to understand the reason and origin of the malfunctions and to avoid reproducing them. Material(s) and Method(s): We surveyed caregivers in the different departments concerned with the use of respiratory filters, learned about the assemblies and positioning of the filters on the respiratory circuit and checked the characteristics of the filters used. Result(s): The causes of the malfunctions were highlighted and corrective actions have been taken in our department to minimise the risk of errors in the use of filters and to ensure that departments have the right filter for the right use. Conclusion(s): The dysfunctions observed were favoured by a context of epidemic crisis but also by a lack of communication and diffusion of written and explicit document while sending of unusual filter references to ventilator user services. This incident should alert us to the need, in the future, to widely associate all the actors involved, when drafting similar protocols, from the purchase of medical devices to the final users, including the biomedical service.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS	false
0	Estimating individual risks of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death using publicly available data. We describe a method to estimate individual risks of hospitalization and death attributable to non-household and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using available public data on confirmed-case incidence data along with estimates of the clinical fraction, timing of transmission, isolation adherence, secondary infection risks, contact rates, and case-hospitalization and case-fatality ratios. Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation.	false
0	Docking Prediction of Amantadine in the Receptor Binding Domain of Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2. Amantadine has recently been shown to improve patients with COVID-19. In addition to its known mechanism of actions, we performed docking prediction of this drug on the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that such interaction may possibly have contributed a role in the clinical improvements reported.Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.	false

0	Clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 in Iceland: population based cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)., DESIGN: Population based cohort study., SETTING: Iceland., PARTICIPANTS: All individuals who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between 17 March and 30 April 2020. Cases were identified by three testing strategies: targeted testing guided by clinical suspicion, open invitation population screening based on self referral, and random population screening. All identified cases were enrolled in a telehealth monitoring service, and symptoms were systematically monitored from diagnosis to recovery., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of one or more of 19 predefined symptoms during follow-up., RESULTS: Among 1564 people positive for SARS-CoV-2, the most common presenting symptoms were myalgia (55%), headache (51%), and non-productive cough (49%). At the time of diagnosis, 83 (5.3%) individuals reported no symptoms, of whom 49 (59%) remained asymptomatic during follow-up. At diagnosis, 216 (14%) and 349 (22%) people did not meet the case definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, respectively. Most (67%) of the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had mild symptoms throughout the course of their disease., CONCLUSION: In the setting of broad access to RT-PCR testing, most SARS-CoV-2-positive people were found to have mild symptoms. Fever and dyspnoea were less common than previously reported. A substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive people did not meet recommended case definitions at the time of diagnosis.

0	Prevalence of opportunistic invasive aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. Background: As the global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) spreads across the world, new clinical challenges emerge in the hospital landscape. Among these challenges, the increased risk of coinfections is a major threat to the patients. Although still in a low number, due to the short time of the pandemic, studies that identified a significant number of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who developed secondary fungal infections that led to serious complications and even death have been published. Objective(s): In this scenario, we aim to determine the prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) and describe possible associated risk factors in patients admitted due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Patients/Methods: We designed an open prospective observational study at the Rey Juan Carlos University Hospital (Mostoles, Spain), during the period from February 1 to April 30, 2020. Result(s): In this article, we reported seven patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) who had a poor prognosis. Severely ill patients represent a high-risk group; therefore, we must actively investigate the possibility of aspergillosis in all of these patients. Larger cohort studies are needed to unravel the role of COVID-19 immunosuppressive therapy as a risk factor for aspergillosis. Conclusion(s): As the pandemic continues to spread across the world, further reports are needed to assess the frequency of emergent and highly resistant reemergent fungal infections during severe COVID-19. These coinfections are leading a significant number of patients with COVID-19 to death due to complications following the primary viral disease.Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH	false
0	New York State and the Nation: Trends in Firearm Purchases and Firearm Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The impacts of social stressors on violence during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are unknown. We hypothesized that firearm purchases and violence would increase surrounding the pandemic. This study determined the impact of COVID-19 and shelter-in-place (SIP) orders on firearm purchases and incidents in the United States (US) and New York State (NYS)., METHODS: Scatterplots reflected trends in firearm purchases, incidents, and deaths over a 16-month period (January 2019 to April 2020). Bivariate comparisons of SIP and non-SIP jurisdictions before and after SIP (February 2020 vs. April 2020) and April 2020 vs. April 2019 were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test., RESULTS: The incidence of COVID-19 in the US increased between February and April 2020 from 24 to 1 067 660 and in NYS from 0 to 304 372. When comparing February to March to April in the US, firearm purchases increased 33.6% then decreased 22.0%, whereas firearm incidents increased 12.2% then again increased by 3.6% and firearm deaths increased 23.8% then decreased in April by 3.8%. In NYS, comparing February to March to April 2020, firearm purchases increased 87.6% then decreased 54.8%, firearm incidents increased 110.1% then decreased 30.8%, and firearm deaths increased 57.1% then again increased by 6.1%. In both SIP and non-SIP jurisdictions, April 2020 firearm purchases, incidents, deaths, and injuries were similar to April 2019 and February 2020 (all P = NS)., DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease 2019-related stressors may have triggered an increase in firearm purchases nationally and within NYS in March 2020. Firearm incidents also increased in NYS. SIP orders had no effect on firearm purchases and firearm violence.	false
0	Phytoplankton blooms below the Antarctic landfast ice during the melt season between late spring and early summer. Antarctic regions are known to be mainly dominated by diatoms in the water column under sea ice. In this study, we report for the first time two distinct phytoplankton blooms dominated by nanoflagellates (< 15 microm) under the landfast ice in Terra Nova Bay during the late spring-early summer 2015-2016. The taxa included the pelagic Bolidophyceae Pentalamina corona, the Chrysophyceae Ochromonas spp. and the Chlorophyceae Chlamydomonas spp., typically found in fresh waters, and the Prymnesiophyceae Phaeocystis antarctica usually observed dominating in polynya areas. These species represented from 40% to 91% of the total phytoplankton community, a percentage contrasting with the prevalence of diatoms found previously. The dominance of nanoflagellates, rather than diatoms, during late spring and early summer may have important implications for trophic relationships in Antarctic waters and the presence of typical freshwater species could indicate a great input of continental waters related to environmental changes.

0	No SARS-CoV-2 carriage observed in children attending daycare centers during the first weeks of the epidemic in Belgium. To gain knowledge about the role of young children attending daycare in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a random sample of children (n=84) aged between 6 and 30 months attending daycare in Belgium was studied shortly after the start of the epidemic (February 29th ) and before the lockdown (March 18th ) by performing in-house SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. No asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas common cold symptoms were common (51.2%). Our study shows that in Belgium, there is no sign of early introduction into daycare centers at a moment children were not yet isolated at home although the virus was clearly circulating. It is clear that more evidence is needed to understand the actual role of young children in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and their infection risk when attending daycare.

0	Treating Opioid Use Disorder in Puerto Rico During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Providers' Leadership Efforts in Unprecedented Times. : Opioid use disorder (OUD) is an unprecedented medical and public health issue both in Puerto Rico (PR) and the greater US with an increase incidence of opioid use every year. Unprecedented and compounded emergencies in PR such as those caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with limited national and local governmental support, has forced most clinics in PR to take action to be able to continue providing care. This commentary summarizes the leadership and clinical initiatives of 3 community organizations in PR to maintain services for people with OUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Local legislation that supported the continuity of OUD care is summarized, along with unique experiences specific to each organization. In addition, the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged people or experiencing homelessness as well as those affected by these compounded events in PR is discussed, with an emphasis on how some challenges were addressed and future directions for continuity of care as our country adjusts to new demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Epidemiologic trends and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children in the United States. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections among children in the United States., RECENT FINDINGS: In the United States, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have been mild illnesses, with those 5-17 years of age having the highest frequency. Specifically, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in children is two times higher in adolescents (12-17 years) than younger school-aged children (5-11 years). Despite the higher case counts in older children, 10% of pediatric hospitalizations have been in infants less than one year. In addition, severe respiratory and renal complications, hospitalization, and even death have been documented in children., SUMMARY: Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress, with mild nonspecific symptoms being the most commonly reported. The broad clinical presentation and the frequency of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections in children pose challenges for controlling and detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, severe disease has been noted in children with associated medical complications and death. Thus, additional active surveillance and research is needed to understand the burden children contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States.	false
0	Framework for creating an incident command center during crises. The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is an incident management system specific to hospitals based on the principles of Incident Command System (ICS), and it includes prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. It plays a crucial role in effective and timely response during the periods of disasters, mass casualties, and public health emergencies. In recent times, hospitals have used a customized HICS structure to coordinate effective responses to public health problems such as the Ebola outbreak in the US and SARS epidemic in Taiwan. The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented challenges on the healthcare system, necessitating the creation of HICS that can help in the proper allocation of resources and ineffective utilization of healthcare personnel. The key elements in managing a response to this pandemic include screening and early diagnosis, quarantining affected individuals, monitoring disease progression, delivering appropriate treatment, and ensuring an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare staff.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Geographic Variation in Racial Disparities in Health and Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Mortality. Objective: To evaluate the race-stratified state-level prevalence of health determinants and the racial disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence and mortality in the United States. Patients and Methods: The age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and malignant neoplasm), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, and physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, and health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality rate and infection-fatality ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Result(s): Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3%; 95% CI, 62.4% to 64.2% vs 55.1%; 95% CI, 54.7% to 55.5%) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0%; 95% CI, 46.0% to 47.9% vs 30.9%; 95% CI, 30.6% to 31.3%) than did whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar in blacks (30.4%; 95% CI, 28.8% to 32.1%) and whites (30.8%; 95% CI, 30.2% to 31.4%). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in whites (57.2%; 95% CI, 56.3% to 58.0%) than in blacks (50.2%; 95% CI,46.2% to 54.2%). Comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the western region. The cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was 3-fold higher in blacks (1546.4) than in whites (540.4). The crude mortality rate (per 100,000 persons) was 2-fold higher in blacks (83.2) than in whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality ratio (per 100 cases) was similar in whites (6.2) and blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with the state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (P>.05 for all). Conclusion(s): Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Flank Pain as a Symptom of COVID-19. The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect the patients early to prevent the spread of the disease.1,2 We report a case of 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	A Randomized Trial of Convalescent Plasma in Covid-19 Severe Pneumonia. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma is frequently administered to patients with Covid-19 and has been reported, largely on the basis of observational data, to improve clinical outcomes. Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials., METHODS: We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death., RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200]. No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P = 0.46). Overall mortality was 10.96% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95% CI, -7.8 to 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.

0	SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein D614G mutation increases virion spike density and infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike (S)-protein D614G mutations now predominate globally. We therefore compare the properties of the mutated S protein (SG614) with the original (SD614). We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than those with SD614. This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion. Similar results are obtained with virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.	false
0	Evidence for treatment with estradiol for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: Given that an individual's age and gender are strongly predictive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, do such factors imply anything about preferable therapeutic options?, METHODS: An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in 5-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and peri-/post-menopausal (> 50 years)., RESULTS: The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is higher in women than men (by about + 15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about + 50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are linked to age: pre-adolescent girls and boys had the same risk of infection and fatality rate, while adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same 5-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in peri- and postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years, there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17s-estradiol influences expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users vs. non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels., CONCLUSIONS: As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.	false
0	No Evidence of Coronaviruses or Other Potentially Zoonotic Viruses in Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) Entering the Wildlife Trade via Malaysia. The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (> 50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families-Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In the light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our 'upstream' market chain samples suggests that these detections in 'downstream' animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.	false

0	Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19: barotrauma or lung frailty?. Background: In mechanically ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients infected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we frequently recognised the development of pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema despite employing a protective mechanical ventilation strategy. The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19 patients was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and if this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or to lung frailty., Methods: We identified both a cohort of patients with ARDS and COVID-19 (CoV-ARDS), and a cohort of patients with ARDS from other causes (noCoV-ARDS). Patients with CoV-ARDS were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic and had microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. NoCoV-ARDS was identified by an ARDS diagnosis in the 5 years before the COVID-19 pandemic period., Results: Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 23 out of 169 (13.6%) patients with CoV-ARDS and in three out of 163 (1.9%) patients with noCoV-ARDS (p<0.001). Mortality was 56.5% in CoV-ARDS patients with pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema and 50% in patients without pneumomediastinum (p=0.46). CoV-ARDS patients had a high incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema despite the use of low tidal volume (5.9+/-0.8 mL.kg-1 ideal body weight) and low airway pressure (plateau pressure 23+/-4 cmH2O)., Conclusions: We observed a seven-fold increase in pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in CoV-ARDS. An increased lung frailty in CoV-ARDS could explain this finding more than barotrauma, which, according to its etymology, refers to high transpulmonary pressure. Copyright ©ERS 2020.	false
0	Remote Patient Monitoring for Home Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in New York: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a global public health emergency, overwhelming health systems worldwide and forcing rapid adoption of telemedicine strategies. Introduction: The COVID-19 Precision Recovery Program (PRP) is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) clinical program that was deployed by a New York health system to perform physiologic and symptomatic monitoring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from the PRP during the COVID-19 crisis in New York. Results: One hundred twelve patients were included; mean (standard deviation) age was 49 (17.6) years and 60.7% were female. Most prevalent reported comorbidities were hypertension (36.3%), hypercholesterolemia (26.5%), and diabetes (17.7%). Less than half (44.6%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction COVID test (PCR-test), 33% had an unknown COVID status, and 17.9% had a negative test result. The most commonly reported symptoms included dyspnea (55.4%) and anxiety (55.4%). Anxiety was ranked as the most severe symptom (9.8%), followed by difficulty concentrating (4.5%). Symptom presentation did not significantly differ based on PCR-test status. Discussion: RPM can be a valuable tool for delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Considering similarities in symptom presentation between PCR-test statuses, access to COVID-related clinical care should not be based on PCR-test results. Conclusions: RPM has strong potential to assist in the effective management of suspected COVID-19 patients.	false

0	Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers. The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some ad-hoc questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off >12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.© Copyright © 2020 Spinola, Liotti, Speranza and Tambelli.	false
0	Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in critical care clinicians managing patients with COVID-19 a cross-sectional study. Rationale:Frontlinehealthcareproviders(HCPs)during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are at high risk of mental morbidity. Objective(s): To assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in HCPs. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study in 21 ICUs in France between April 20, 2020, and May 21, 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified. Measurements and Main Results: The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (odds ratio of 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.79], 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.82], and 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.72], respectively). HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified the following six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: Fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions. Conclusion(s): HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.Copyright 2020 by the American Thoracic Society.	false
0	Identifying Predictors of Psychological Distress During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach. Scientific understanding about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is in its nascent stage. Prior research suggests that demographic factors, such as gender and age, are associated with greater distress during a global health crisis. Less is known about how emotion regulation impacts levels of distress during a pandemic. The present study aimed to identify predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 2,787) provided demographics, history of adverse childhood experiences, current coping strategies (use of implicit and explicit emotion regulation), and current psychological distress. The overall prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress was higher than the prevalence outside a pandemic and was higher than rates reported among healthcare workers and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Younger participants (<45 years), women, and non-binary individuals reported higher prevalence of symptoms across all measures of distress. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to identify the strongest predictors of distress. Regression trees were developed to identify individuals at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Somatization and less reliance on adaptive defense mechanisms were associated with greater distress. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individuals' physical experiences of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies to help mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a global health crisis.

0	A 23-Year-Old Man With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome After Mild COVID-19. We present the case of a young obese patient with recent COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) who developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) 1 month after spontaneous resolution. A 23-year-old African American man was admitted with a 1-week history of worsening fatigue, myalgias, headache, and dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative by polymerase chain reaction; however, the patient was febrile and had leukocytosis, elevated troponin I, transaminitis, and acute kidney injury. Bedside echocardiogram showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (40% to 45%) and global hypokinesis in the setting of a type II non-ST segment myocardial infarction. Despite being on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient's clinical condition continued to worsen. The patient was then empirically treated for MIS with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, which led to a rapid resolution of fever and laboratory abnormalities. This case highlights that MIS associated with COVID-19 may present in patients above the age of 21 years and can occur with a delayed onset after mild illness in those with no previous oxygen requirement or hospitalization during SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Low prevalence of bloodstream infection and high blood culture contamination rates in patients with COVID-19. PURPOSE: In the management of COVID-19, knowledge is lacking on the frequency of secondary bacterial infections and on how empirical antibiotic therapy should be used. In the present study, we aimed to compare blood culture (BC) results of a COVID-19 patient cohort with two cohorts of patients without detected COVID-19., METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design of patients subjected to BC in six tertiary care hospitals, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from March 1 to April 30 in 2020 (COVID-19 group) were compared to patients without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during the same period (control group-2020) and with patients sampled March 1 to April 30 in 2019 (control group-2019). The outcomes studied were proportion of BC positivity, clinically relevant growth, and contaminant growth., RESULTS: In total 15,103 patients and 17,865 BC episodes were studied. Clinically relevant growth was detected in 197/3,027 (6.5%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 717/6,663 (10.8%) in control group-2020 (p<0.0001) and 850/8,175 (10.4%) in control group-2019 (p<0.0001). Contamination was present in 255/3,027 (8.4%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 330/6,663 (5.0%) in control group-2020 (p<0.0001) and 354/8,175 (4.3%) in control group-2019 (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of bloodstream bacterial infection is low and the contamination rate of BC is high. This knowledge should influence guidelines regarding blood culture sampling and empirical antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 re-infection: first report from Turkey. There are concerns about the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and recently, a patient with SARS-CoV-2 re-infection (or COVID-19) confirmed by epidemiological, clinical, serological and genomic analyses have been published. We have noticed another patient with SARS-CoV-2 re-infection based on clinical and laboratory studies: A 23-year-old woman presented to her hospital with fever (39degreeC), chills, fatigue, cough, headache, sore throat, muscle and joint pain on April 9, 2020. On examination, oropharynx was mildly hyperemic, and chest auscultation was normal. SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal specimen was ordered. She was given isotonic saline and acetaminophen and prescribed azithromycin and acetaminophen and sent home for isolation. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was reported positive and she was given hydroxychloroquine for five days. She improved in 10 days and PCR studies on April 22, and April 27 remained negative. On 4 August 2020, she was re-admitted with fever (38.7degreeC), chills, fatigue, loss of appetite, taste and smell loss, muscle and joint pain. On examination, oropharynx and chest auscultation were normal. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was reported positive and she was prescribed hydroxychloroquine, acetaminophen and sent home for isolation again. She improved in one week (taste-smell loss improved in 10 days) and on follow-up visit after 14 days, she was doing well. PCR was negative on 17 August 2020. Her anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were negative on 17 August 2020 and slightly positive (2.14 signal-to-cutoff) on 29 August 2020. Previous report from To et al. [Clin Infect Dis. 2020;ciaa1275. doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa1275] showed that viral genomes from first and second episodes belonged to different clades/lineages. They described second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 day after the first symptomatic one. Our patient is the first report, describing two symptomatic episodes 116 days apart. We conclude that as the patients recovered from COVID-19 increases, increased awareness may delineate the characteristics of re-infection. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Tracking COVID-19 using taste and smell loss Google searches is not a reliable strategy. Web search tools are widely used by the general public to obtain health-related information, and analysis of search data is often suggested for public health monitoring. We analyzed popularity of searches related to smell loss and taste loss, recently listed as symptoms of COVID-19. Searches on sight loss and hearing loss, which are not considered as COVID-19 symptoms, were used as control. Google Trends results per region in Italy or state in the US were compared to COVID-19 incidence in the corresponding geographical areas. The COVID-19 incidence did not correlate with searches for non-symptoms, but in some weeks had high correlation with taste and smell loss searches, which also correlated with each other. Correlation of the sensory symptoms with new COVID-19 cases for each country as a whole was high at some time points, but decreased (Italy) or dramatically fluctuated over time (US). Smell loss searches correlated with the incidence of media reports in the US. Our results show that popularity of symptom searches is not reliable for pandemic monitoring. Awareness of this limitation is important during the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread and to exhibit new clinical manifestations, and for potential future health threats.	false
0	"Newly Developed Pediatric Membrane Oxygenator that Suppresses Excessive Pressure Drop in Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). This article developes a pediatric membrane oxygenator that is compact, high performance, and highly safe. This novel experimental approach, which imaging the inside of a membrane oxygenator during fluid perfusion using high-power X-ray CT, identifies air and blood retention in the local part of a membrane oxygenator. The cause of excessive pressure drop in a membrane oxygenator, which has been the most serious dysfunction in cardiovascular surgery and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is the local retention of blood and air inside the oxygenator. Our designed blood flow channel for a membrane oxygenator has a circular channel and minimizes the boundary between laminated parts. The pressure drop in the blood flow channel is reduced, and the maximum gas transfer rates are increased by using this pediatric membrane oxygenator, as compared with the conventional oxygenator. Furthermore, it would be possible to reduce the incidents, which have occurred clinically, due to excessive pressure drop in the blood flow channel of the membrane oxygenator. The membrane oxygenator is said to be the ""last stronghold"" for patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO treatment. Accordingly, the specification of our prototype is promising for low weight and pediatric patients."	false
0	Pericardial effusion in patients with COVID-19: Case series. SARS-coronavirus-2 [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] infection is a public health issue affecting millions of people. It started in Wuhan in China in December 2019 spreading rapidly worldwide. Case summary: Three patients aged 51-84 developed a pericarditis related to COVID-19, associated for two of them with a myocarditis. Case 1 was a COVID-19 cardiac tamponade without myocarditis, confirmed by a positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Case 2 showed a COVID-19 myopericarditis, confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and a SARS-coronavirus-2 positive swab. Case 3 was a cardiac tamponade due to COVID-19 pericarditis, with a positive polymerase chain reaction on pericardial fluid. They were all treated by colchicine and their condition improved rapidly. Discussion(s): Presumably rare, we reported three cases of pericardial effusions (PEs) occurring in a single cardiology centre. There is a higher incidence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases such as pericarditis that can manifest as a minimal PE to a cardiac tamponade, which should result in a higher awareness of cardiologists. A systematic measure of the high-sensitivity troponin kinetic in patients affected by COVID-19 could be interesting in order to screen for potential myocarditis. Any unexplained haemodynamic failure or increased cardiac biomarkers should make the medical team search for myopericarditis by a transthoracic echocardiography. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

We describe a case of coronary artery embolism leading to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in which the diagnosis was achieved with utilisation of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was otherwise well prior to this episode. Emergency diagnostic coronary angiography revealed patent arteries with TIMI 3 flow. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated myocardial infarction and focal microvascular obstruction in the infarcted territory. This report describes an uncommon case presentation, highlights areas for improvement in diagnostic criteria, and briefly discusses the currently available data regarding coronary artery embolism.Copyright © EFIM 2020.	false
0	[The impact of lung diseases, smoking and e-cigarette use on the severity of COVID-19 illness at diagnosis]. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health and economic turmoil across the globe. Severe COVID-19 disease most often presents with pneumonia and complications in acutely ill patients often stem from the lungs. The associations of lung disease, smoking and e-cigarette use with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are unclear on a population level., METHODS: Data on 1761 patients from the Icelandic outpatient Landspitali COVID-19 Clinic were used. The prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use and underlying lung diseases was calculated in the cohort, with stratification based on age groups and a clinical classification of symptom severity. It was tested whether these prevalences differed between age groups and classes of symptom severity., RESULTS: Most patients were in the age group between 35-54 years of age and a large majority had mild symptoms at diagnosis. The prevalence of smoking was 6% with the highest prevalence among 35-54 year olds. The prevalence of e-cigarette use was 4%. It was most prevalent in the age group between 18-34 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of smoking or e-cigarette use between classes of symptom severity. The prevalence of lung disease was 9%. It was higher among older patients and patients with more severe symptoms., CONCLUSION: The age distribution and prevalence of lung disease and their risk factors are described in the context of COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity in a whole-nation cohort of Icelanders. The cohort is younger and had less severe symptoms than in many previosly published studies of COVID-19. Interestingly, the prevalences of smoking and e-cigarette use were lower than in the Icelandic general population and they were not associated with symptom severity at diagnosis. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that underlying lung diseases are prevalent among people with severe COVID-19 symptoms but fail to demonstrate an association between cigarette smoking or e-cigarette smoking with COVID-19 severity.	false
0	New pathogen, same disparities: why COVID-19 and HIV remain prevalent in U.S. communities of colour and implications for ending the HIV epidemic. INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative was launched nationally in February 2019. With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease 11 months into the Initiative's implementation. SARS-COV-2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223 000 (as of 23 October 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post-COVID-19 universe., DISCUSSION: One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID-19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of colour. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re-emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of colour. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID-19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Furthermore, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: (1) Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID-19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) (2) Challenges posed by COVID-19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID-19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and (3) Challenges unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long-term viability of EHE)., CONCLUSIONS: Racism and discrimination place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Increased circulating level of interleukin-6 and CD8+ T cell exhaustion are associated with progression of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic. It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to develop a severe disease. This study was designed to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients associated with the development of pneumonia and factors associated with disease progression., METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with etiologically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China from December 27, 2019 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed-up to March 16, 2020. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without were determined by the chi2 test or the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and independent group t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). The Cox proportional hazard model and Generalized Estimating Equations were applied to evaluate factors that predicted the progression of COVID-19., RESULTS: The mean incubation was 8.67 (95% confidence interval, 6.78-10.56) days. Mean duration from the first test severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive to conversion was 11.38 (9.86-12.90) days. Compared to pneumonia-free patients, pneumonia patients were 16.5 years older and had higher frequencies of having hypertension, fever, and cough and higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, interleukin-6, low count (< 190/microl) of CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thirteen patients deteriorated during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis indicated that older age and higher serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate at admission significantly predicted the progression of COVID-19. During hospitalization, circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower, whereas neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the circulating levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocyte count in pneumonia patients did not recover when discharged., CONCLUSIONS: Older age and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitionin, interleukin-6, and lactate might predict COVID-19 progression. T lymphocyte, especially CD8+ cell-mediated immunity is critical in recovery of COVID-19. This study may help in predicting disease progression and designing immunotherapy for COVID-19.	false

0	Pentoxifylline decreases serum LDH levels and increases lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients: Results from an external pilot study. We have previously hypothesized that pentoxifylline could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 given its potential to restore the immune response equilibrium, reduce the impact of the disease on the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, and improve the circulatory function.Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count are accessible biomarkers that correlate with the severity of COVID-19, the need for hospitalization, and mortality, reflecting the host immune response's contribution to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

0	The impact of episodic screening interruption: COVID-19 and population-based cancer screening in Canada. BACKGROUND: Population-based cancer screening can reduce cancer burden but was interrupted temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated the long-term clinical impact of breast and colorectal cancer screening interruptions in Canada using a validated mathematical model., METHODS: We used the OncoSim breast and colorectal cancers microsimulation models to explore scenarios of primary screening stops for 3, 6, and 12 months followed by 6-24-month transition periods of reduced screening volumes. For breast cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, additional advanced-stage cases diagnosed, and excess cancer deaths in 2020-2029. For colorectal cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, undiagnosed advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in 2020, and lifetime excess cancer incidence and deaths., RESULTS: Our simulations projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, a three-month interruption could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and cancer deaths (110 more) in 2020-2029. A six-month interruption could lead to 670 extra advanced cancers and 250 additional cancer deaths. For colorectal cancers, a six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Interruptions in cancer screening will lead to additional cancer deaths, additional advanced cancers diagnosed, and a surge in demand for downstream resources when screening resumes. An effective strategy is needed to minimize potential harm to people who missed their screening.	false
0	Design and rationale of an intelligent algorithm to detect BuRnoUt in HeaLthcare workers in COVID era using ECG and artificiaL intelligence: The BRUCEE-LI study. Background: There is no large contemporary data from India to see the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in covid era. Burnout and mental stress is associated with electrocardiographic changes detectable by artificial intelligence (AI). Objective(s): The present study aims to estimate the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era using Mini Z-scale and to develop predictive AI model to detect burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era. Method(s): This is an observational and cross-sectional study to evaluate the presence of burnout in HCWs in academic tertiary care centres of North India in the COVID-19 era. At least 900 participants will be enrolled in this study from four leading premier government-funded/public-private centres of North India. Each study centre will be asked to recruit HCWs by approaching them through various listed ways for participation in the study. Interested participants after initial screening and meeting the eligibility criteria, will be asked to fill the questionnaire (having demographic and work related with Mini Z questionnaire) to assess burnout. The healthcare workers will include physicians at all levels of training, nursing staff and paramedical staff who are involved directly or indirectly in COVID-19 care. The analysis of the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data and development of algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be done by experts. Conclusion(s): In Summary, we propose that ECG data generated from the people with burnout can be utilized to develop AI-enabled model to predict the presence of stress and burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era.Copyright © 2020 Cardiological Society of India	false
0	Association between different screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths and severe disease in Italy. BACKGROUND: The WHO recommends testing any suspected person with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in order to limit the spread of the epidemic. In Italy, some Regions opted for extensive testing, whereas others limited tests to selected subjects. To assess the influence of different strategies, we examined the incidence of death and severe cases in Italy., METHODS: Data on new cases of SARS-CoV-2, number of tests, deaths, and admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICU) were retrieved in each Italian Region, from February 24th to March 18th , 2020. As an index of different screening strategies, the number of tests/positive test results (P/T) ratio as of March 7th , 2020, was considered. The cumulative number of deaths and of new severe cases, between March 23th and 25th was recorded. The association of those two outcomes with the number of P/T ratio was assessed using linear regression models., RESULTS: In the interval between March 23th -25th , recorded deaths (*million inhabitants) were 14(3-54), whereas severe cases were 31(10-112). Both the number of deaths and that of severe cases showed a significant correlation (R2 .57 and .41, with p<.01) with the P/T ratio. Deaths and severe cases were associated with higher mean personal income and lower density of General Practioners (GPs). The association of P/T with severe cases and deaths retained statistical significance after adjusting for mean personal income (R2 .30 and .41, respectively; both p=.04) and GPs density (R2 .21 and .19, respectively; both p=.03)., CONCLUSIONS: A more aggressive screening strategy for SARS-Cov-2, was associated with lower rates of death and severe disease in Regions of Italy.

0	Implications of covid-19 for the management of chronic non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa: Application of the chronic care model. About 41 million people die of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs) each year, accounting for 71% of all global deaths. The high prevalence of CNCDs is particularly problematic for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) since CNCDs are already a major cause of mortality in the subregion. While the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is quite low, it is worth noting that people with underlying CNCDs constitute the majority of those who die from this virus. Underpinned by the chronic care model (CCM), we present a commentary on the implications of COVID-19 for the management of CNCDs in SSA. We realized that despite the World Health Organisation's guidelines for countries to maintain essential services while putting necessary measures in place to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19, myriad of health systems and community-level factors militate against effective management of the CNCDs in SSA. This results in disruptions in management of the conditions as well as possible long-term effects such as the deterioration of the health status of CNCD patients and even deaths. Without immediate interventions to salvage the status quo, SSA countries may not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 target of reducing by one-third, premature mortality from CNCDs by the year 2030. We recommend that financial constraints could be ameliorated through short- and long-term loan facilities from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to augment national efforts at strengthening health systems while combating COVID-19. We also recommend increased community engagement and public education by COVID-19 response teams to enhance community support for persons living with CNCDs and to reduce social stigmatization.Copyright © Hubert Amu et al.	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 905 COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex in the Capital City of Tehran, Iran. BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 905 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (IKHC), Tehran, Iran., METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited based on clinical symptoms and patterns of computed tomography (CT) imaging between February 20 and March 19. All patients were tested for the presence of COVID-19 RNA. The Poisson regression model estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for different parameters., RESULTS: The average age (+/- standard deviation) was 56.9 (+/-15.7) years and 61.77% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (93.59%), dry cough (79.78%), and dyspnea (75.69%). Only 43.76% of patients were positive for the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. Prevalence of lymphopenia was 42.9% and more than 90% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or C-reactive protein (CRP). About 11% were severe cases, and 13.7% died in the hospital. The median length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. We found higher risks of mortality in patients who were older than 70 years (IRR = 11.77, 95% CI 3.63-38.18), underwent mechanical ventilation (IRR = 7.36, 95% CI 5.06-10.7), were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (IRR = 5.47, 95% CI 4.00-8.38), tested positive on the COVID-19 test (IRR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.64-3.55), and reported a history of comorbidity (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.89) compared to their corresponding reference groups. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was not associated with mortality in our study., CONCLUSION: Older age, experiencing a severe form of the disease, and having a comorbidity were the most important prognostic factors for COVID-19 infection. Larger studies are needed to perform further subgroup analyses and verify high-risk groups. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Glycemic control before admission is an important determinant of prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Aims/Introduction: This study aimed to explore the association between glycemic control before admission with severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019, and tried to reveal the mechanism. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 77 inpatients were grouped into sufficient control group (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] <6.5%, n = 49) and insufficient control group (HbA1c >=6.5%, n = 28). Regression models were used to analyze the clinical data. Result(s): Compared with patients with HbA1c <6.5, patients with HbA1c >=6.5 showed higher heart rate (101 vs 89 b.p.m., P = 0.012), lower percutaneous oxygen saturation (93 vs 97%, P = 0.001), higher levels of multiple indicators of inflammation, such as white blood cell count (7.9 vs 5.9 x 109/L, P = 0.019), neutrophil count (6.5 vs 4.1 x 109/L, P = 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (52 vs 30 mg/L, P = 0.025) and serum ferritin (1,287 vs 716 mug/L, P = 0.023), as well as lower levels of lymphocyte count (0.7 vs 0.8 x 109/L, P = 0.049) at hospital admission. Thus, patients with HbA1c >=6.5 were more likely to develop secondary respiratory infections (25 [89%] vs 33 [67%], P = 0.032) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (17 [61%] vs 14 [29%], P = 0.006) than patients with HbA1c <6.5, resulting in a higher proportion of critically ill patients (19 [68%] vs 18 [37%], P = 0.009) and non-survivors (13 [46%] vs 11 [22%], P = 0.029). After adjustment for potential risk factors, HbA1c was independently associated with in-hospital death. Conclusion(s): HbA1c was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe pulmonary infection and consequent acute respiratory distress syndrome might be the primary causes of death in insufficient glycemic control patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS): protocol for an observational study using linked Scottish national data. INTRODUCTION: The effects of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are not fully delineated. We will describe the incidence of COVID-19 in pregnancy at population level in Scotland, in a prospective cohort study using linked data. We will determine associations between COVID-19 and adverse pregnancy, neonatal and maternal outcomes and the proportion of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates associated with maternal COVID-19., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective cohort study using national linked data sets. We will include all women in Scotland, UK, who were pregnant on or became pregnant after, 1 March 2020 (the date of the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland) and all births in Scotland from 1 March 2020 onwards. Individual-level data will be extracted from data sets containing details of all livebirths, stillbirth, terminations of pregnancy and miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies treated in hospital or attending general practice. Records will be linked within the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, which includes primary care records, virology and serology results and details of COVID-19 Community Hubs and Assessment Centre contacts and deaths. We will perform analyses using definitions for confirmed, probable and possible COVID-19 and report serology results (where available). Outcomes will include congenital anomaly, miscarriage, stillbirth, termination of pregnancy, preterm birth, neonatal infection, severe maternal disease and maternal deaths. We will perform descriptive analyses and appropriate modelling, adjusting for demographic and pregnancy characteristics and the presence of comorbidities. The cohort will provide a platform for future studies of the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions and immunisations for COVID-19 and their effects on childhood and developmental outcomes., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland is a substudy of EAVE II(, which has approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee. Findings will be reported to Scottish Government, Public Health Scotland and published in peer-reviewed journals. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

0	The lower COVID-19 related mortality and incidence rates in Eastern European countries are associated with delayed start of community circulation. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the variations in COVID-19 related mortality in relation to the time differences in the commencement of virus circulation and containment measures in the European Region., METHODS: The data for the current analysis (N = 50 countries) were retrieved from the John Hopkins University dataset on the 7th of May 2020, with countries as study units. A piecewise regression analysis was conducted with mortality and cumulative incidence rates introduced as dependent variables and time interval (days from the 22nd of January to the date when 100 first cases were reported) as the main predictor. The country average life expectancy at birth and outpatient contacts per person per year were statistically adjusted for in the regression model., RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were strongly and inversely intercorrelated with days from January 22, respectively -0.83 (p<0.001) and -0.73 (p<0.001). Adjusting for average life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year, between days 33 to 50 from the 22nd of the January, the average mortality rate decreased by 30.1/million per day (95% CI: 22.7, 37.6, p<0.001). During interval 51 to 73 days, the change in mortality was no longer statistically significant but still showed a decreasing trend. A similar relationship with time interval was found for incidence. Life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year were not associated with mortality rate., CONCLUSION: Countries in Europe that had the earliest COVID-19 circulation suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. The drastic social isolation measures, quickly undertaken in response to those initial outbreaks appear effective, especially in Eastern European countries, where community circulation started after March 11th. The study demonstrates that efforts to delay the early spread of the virus may have saved an average 30 deaths daily per one million inhabitants.	false
0	Mental health of healthcare professionals during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic causes healthcare professionals to suffer mental health problems such as psychological distress, anxiety, depression, denial and fear. However, studies are lacking related to Ethiopia and to Africa in general., AIMS: To study the mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia., METHOD: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Jimma University Medical Center among 249 healthcare professionals. The data were collected using self-administered questionnaires between 22 and 28 March 2020. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Social support was evaluated using the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale. Data were analysed using logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. The psychosocial status of the healthcare professionals was predicted using a classification tree model supported by the genetic search method., RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals was 78.3%. The mean IES-R score was 34.2 (s.d. = 19.4). The ISI score indicated that the prevalence of insomnia was 50.2%. Higher psychological distress was associated with younger age, having insomnia, not having a daily update on COVID-19, and feeling stigmatised and rejected in the neighbourhood because of hospital work., CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that, in Ethiopia, the prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals is high and associated with specific sociodemographic risks.	false

OBJECTIVE: To compare the mental health and psychological responses in Wuhan, a severely affected area, and other areas of China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during February 10-20, 2020. A set of online questionnaires was employed to measure mental health and responses. 1,397 participants from Wuhan (age: 36.4 +/- 10.7; male: 36.1%) and 2,794 age- and sex-matched participants from other areas of China (age: 35.9 +/- 9.9; male: 39.0%) were recruited., RESULTS: Compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan had significantly higher prevalence of any mental health problems (46.6% vs. 32.2%; adjusted OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.65-2.17), anxiety (15.2% vs. 6.2%; adjusted OR=2.65, 95%CI=2.14-3.29), depression (18.3% vs. 9.7%; adjusted OR = 2.11, 95%CI=1.74-2.54), suicidal ideation (10.5% vs. 7.1%; adjusted OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.28-2.02), and insomnia (38.6% vs. 27.6%; adjusted OR=1.70, 95%CI=1.48-1.96). Participants from Wuhan had a slightly higher rate of help-seeking behavior (7.1% vs. 4.2%, adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.12-2.77) but similar rate of treatment (3.5% vs. 2.7%, adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI=0.68-2.24) for mental problems than their counterparts. In addition, compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan gave higher proportions of responses regarding ""fearful"" (52% vs. 36%, P < .001), ""discrimination against COVID-19 cases"" (64% vs. 58%, P = .006), ""strictly comply with preventive behaviors"" (98.7% vs. 96%, P =.003), and ""fewer living and medical supplies"" (<2 weeks: 62% vs. 57%, P = .015)., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic has raised enormous challenges regarding public mental health and psychological responses, especially in the highly affected Wuhan area. The present findings provide important information for developing appropriate strategies for the prevention and management of mental health problems during COVID-19 and other epidemics."	false
0	Exploring Perceived Stress among Students in Turkey during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Students have been highly vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, and researchers have shown that perceived stress and mental health problems have increased during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to reveal the prevalence of perceived stress and mental health among students during the pandemic and to explore predictors of stress levels. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 358 undergraduates from 14 universities in Turkey, including 200 female students (56%). The measurements used in the study were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Perception of COVID Impact on Student Well-Being (CI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Physical Activity Scale (PA), and a sociodemographic survey. Students reported high perceived stress, mild generalized anxiety, and low satisfaction with life. More than half of the students met the diagnostic criteria of GAD (52%) and depression (63%). Female and physically inactive students had higher PSS-10 levels. A hierarchical linear regression model showed that after controlling for gender and negative CI, anxiety and physical inactivity significantly predicted high perceived stress. The study shows that students' mental health during the pandemic is at high risk.	false
0	Rational development of a human antibody cocktail that deploys multiple functions to confer Pan-SARS-CoVs protection. Structural principles underlying the composition and synergistic mechanisms of protective monoclonal antibody cocktails are poorly defined. Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of our previously identified humanized cross-neutralizing antibody H014, we systematically analyzed a fully human naive antibody library and rationally identified a potent neutralizing antibody partner, P17, which confers effective protection in animal model. Cryo-EM studies dissected the nature of the P17 epitope, which is SARS-CoV-2 specific and distinctly different from that of H014. High-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with H014 and P17, together with functional investigations revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, synergistic neutralization was achieved by S1 shielding and conformational locking, thereby blocking receptor attachment and viral membrane fusion, conferring high potency as well as robustness against viral mutation escape. Furthermore, cluster analysis identified a hypothetical 3rd antibody partner for further reinforcing the cocktail as pan-SARS-CoVs therapeutics.	false
0	Application of Viral Vectors for Vaccine Development with a Special Emphasis on COVID-19. Viral vectors can generate high levels of recombinant protein expression providing the basis for modern vaccine development. A large number of different viral vector expression systems have been utilized for targeting viral surface proteins and tumor-associated antigens. Immunization studies in preclinical animal models have evaluated the elicited humoral and cellular responses and the possible protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious pathogens or tumor cells. Several vaccine candidates for both infectious diseases and various cancers have been subjected to a number of clinical trials. Human immunization trials have confirmed safe application of viral vectors, generation of neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenges with lethal doses. A special emphasis is placed on COVID-19 vaccines based on viral vectors. Likewise, the flexibility and advantages of applying viral particles, RNA replicons and DNA replicon vectors of self-replicating RNA viruses for vaccine development are presented.	false
0	Derivation with Internal Validation of a Multivariable Predictive Model to Predict COVID-19 Test Results in Emergency Department Patients. OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed acute care providers in demanding situations in predicting disease given the clinical variability, desire to cohort patients, and high variance in testing availability. An approach to stratify patients by likelihood of disease based on rapidly available emergency department (ED) clinical data would offer significant operational and clinical value. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a predictive model to aid in the discrimination of patients undergoing investigation for COVID-19., METHODS: All patients greater than 18 years presenting to a single academic ED who were tested for COVID-19 during this index ED evaluation were included. Outcome was defined as the result of COVID-19 PCR testing during the index visit or any positive result within the following 7 days. Variables included chest radiograph interpretation, disease specific screening questions, and laboratory data. Three models were developed with a split-sample approach to predict outcome of the PCR test utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision-tree methods. Model discrimination was evaluated comparing AUC and point statistics at a predefined threshold., RESULTS: 1026 patients were included in the study collected between March and April 2020. Overall, there was disease prevalence of 9.6% in the population under study during this time frame. The logistic regression model was found to have an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.94) when including four features: exposure history, temperature, WBC, and chest radiograph result. Random forest method resulted in AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 - 0.92) and gradient boosting had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.91). With a consistently held negative predictive value, the logistic regression model had a positive predictive value of 0.29 (0.2-0.39) compared to 0.2 (0.14-0.28) for random forest and 0.22 (0.15 - 0.3) for the gradient boosted method., CONCLUSION: The derived predictive models offer good discriminating capacity for COVID-19 disease and provide interpretable and usable methods for those providers caring for these patients at the important crossroads of the community and the health system. We found utilization of the logistic regression model utilizing exposure history, temperature, WBC, and Chest XR result had the greatest discriminatory capacity with the most interpretable model. Integrating a predictive model-based approach to COVID-19 testing decisions and patient care pathways and locations could add efficiency and accuracy to decrease uncertainty.

0	Recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Present study aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Fourteen studies of 2568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.4 days (95% CI 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to the recurrent positive result was 9.8 days (95% CI 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age and a longer initial illness were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes, severe disease, and a low lymphocyte count were less likely to experience. Present study concluded that the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% suggesting further studies must be conducted to elucidate the possibility of infectious individuals with prolonged or recurrent RNA positivity.	false
0	Psychological screening and tracking of athletes and the potential for digital mental health solutions in a hybrid model of care: A mini review. BACKGROUND: There is a persistent need for mental ill-health prevention and intervention among 'at-risk' and vulnerable subpopulations. Major disruptions to humanity such as the COVID-19 pandemic present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an under-recognition of mental ill-health as well as engagement difficulties which have hindered research, prevention and intervention efforts., OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes' increased vulnerability to mental ill-health, and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention. To show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking and faster and better treatment algorithms., METHODS: Mini review., RESULTS: Consensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence as the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for utilization in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing and digital mental health screening and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health., CONCLUSIONS: Athletes are an 'at-risk' subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience which helps them to positively adjust after a period of 'overwhelming' stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely utilized among general populations but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sport in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to seeking help by increasing awareness of the range of mental ill-health through to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies that may be utilized in prevention and early intervention strategies., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Perforated Appendicitis: An Unintended Consequence During the Coronavirus-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had major clinical impact across the globe. Delayed presentation for medical emergencies has been noted by the medical community. There has been limited reporting on the impact for the care for emergent surgical conditions. We sought to describe the effect of the global pandemic on the presentation and outcomes for the most common urgent general surgery disease process, acute appendicitis., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the United States Naval Hospital Okinawa during the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2020 to May 2020 (COVID cohort), and compared them to a historical cohort (pre-COVID cohort) over the prior 2 years. Demographics, clinical presentation data, and interventions were collected., RESULTS: Of the 80 patients with appendicitis, 20% presented perforated. Most patients were male (71%), presented with 1 day of symptoms and had a length of stay of 1 to 2 days. Comparing groups, 13% of the pre-COVID group vs. 31% of the COVID cohort presented perforated (P = .04), with a symptom duration of 1.6 vs. 2.7 days before presentation (P = .075), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and the global systematic response has impacted unrelated medical and surgical conditions. At our overseas military hospital with minimal disease burden, we observed a delay in presentation for acute appendicitis with a higher incidence of perforation. Patients should be empowered to continue to seek care for urgent and emergent medical and surgical conditions so that they are not harmed by fear of COVID-19 rather than by COVID-19 itself.

0	Clinical symptoms, comorbidities and complications in severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis without cases duplication. BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 poses a challenge to global healthcare. The mortality rates of severe cases range from 8.1% to 38%, and it is particularly important to identify risk factors that aggravate the disease., METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis, using 7 databases to identify studies reporting on clinical characteristics, comorbidities and complications in severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19. All the observational studies were included. We performed a random or fixed effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI). Measure of heterogeneity was estimated by Cochran's Q statistic, I index and P value., RESULTS: A total of 4881 cases from 25 studies related to COVID-19 were included. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (severe: 33.4%, 95% CI: 25.4%-41.4%; non-severe 21.6%, 95% CI: 9.9%-33.3%), followed by diabetes (severe: 14.4%, 95% CI: 11.5%-17.3%; non-severe: 8.5%, 95% CI: 6.1%-11.0%). The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury and shock were all higher in severe cases, with 41.1% (95% CI: 14.1%-68.2%), 16.4% (95% CI: 3.4%-29.5%) and 19.9% (95% CI: 5.5%-34.4%), rather than 3.0% (95% CI: 0.6%-5.5%), 2.2% (95% CI: 0.1%-4.2%) and 4.1% (95% CI: -4.8%-13.1%) in non-severe patients, respectively. The death rate was higher in severe cases (30.3%, 95% CI: 13.8%-46.8%) than non-severe cases (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.1%-2.8%)., CONCLUSION: Hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases may be risk factors for severe COVID-19.	false
0	Dementia and the risk of death in elderly patients with COVID-19 infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Objectives: The COVID-19 infection represents a global public health emergency worldwide. Several risk factors have been associated with a poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. We aimed to perform a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia and COVID-19 infection. Method(s): Literature search was based on Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar to locate articles published between December 2019 and July 2020, presenting the number of survived versus deceased patients with dementia and COVID-19 infection. Result(s): A total of 233 articles were retrieved: 158 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, leaving 75 articles to assess for eligibility. After evaluation of the full-text articles, eight met the inclusion criteria and were thus included into the final analysis (6493 patients - mean age: 69.6 years). Among COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of dementia was higher in non-survivors compared with survivors (17.5% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). The pooled analysis performed using a random-effect model showed an increase in the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with dementia (odds ratio: 3.75; 95% confidence interval: 2.54-5.54, p < 0.0001, I2 = 49.5%). The Egger's regression test confirmed that there were not statistically evidences of publication bias (t = 0.059; p = 0.954). Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results suggest that patients with COVID-19 infection and dementia have a higher mortality risk in the short-term period compared with infected non-demented individuals. Due to their intrinsic frailty, dementia patients may require a more aggressive treatment and prompt isolation to improve their short-term outcome.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Incidence of thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the incidence of thromboembolism has been increasingly reported. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism among COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. Method(s): Medline, Embase, Scopus, and grey literature were searched until June 2020. Observational studies reported on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial thromboembolism (ATE) were included. The pool incidences and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model. Result(s): A total of 36 studies were included. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, the pooled incidence of VTE was 28% (95% CI, 22-34%). Subgroups based on compression ultrasound (CUS) screening revealed a higher incidence of DVT in the CUS screening group than in the no CUS screening group (32% [95% CI, 18-45%] vs. 6% [95% CI, 4-9%]). The pooled incidence of ATE in ICU was 3% (95% CI, 2-5%). In the non-ICU setting, the pooled incidence of VTE was 10% (95% CI, 6-14%,). Conclusion(s): The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients was higher in the ICU setting than in the non-ICU setting, and also significantly higher in studies that incorporated the CUS screening protocol. The incidence of ATE in the ICU setting was low. VTE prophylactic measures should be given to all hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 and Cancer: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Much of routine cancer care has been disrupted due to the perceived susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. Here, we systematically review the current evidence base pertaining to the prevalence, presentation and outcome of COVID-19 in cancer patients, in order to inform policy and practice going forwards. A keyword-structured systematic search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase and MedRxiv databases for studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 in cancer patients. Studies were critically appraised using the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's quality assessment tool set. The pooled prevalence of cancer as a co-morbidity in patients with COVID-19 and pooled in-hospital mortality risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients were derived by random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 110 studies from 10 countries were included. The pooled prevalence of cancer as a co-morbidity in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 1.8%, 3.5%, I2: 92.0%). Specifically, 1.7% (95% confidence interval 1.3%, 2.3%, I2: 57.6.%) in China and 5.6% (95% confidence interval 4.5%, 6.7%, I2: 82.3%) in Western countries. Patients most commonly presented with non-specific symptoms of fever, dyspnoea and chest tightness in addition to decreased arterial oxygen saturation, ground glass opacities on computer tomography and non-specific changes in inflammatory markers. The pooled in-hospital mortality risk among patients with COVID-19 and cancer was 14.1% (95% confidence interval 9.1%, 19.8%, I2: 52.3%). We identified impeding questions that need to be answered to provide the foundation for an iterative review of the developing evidence base, and inform policy and practice going forwards. Analyses of the available data corroborate an unfavourable outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Our findings encourage future studies to report detailed social, demographic and clinical characteristics of cancer patients, including performance status, primary cancer type and stage, as well as a history of anti-cancer therapeutic interventions.

0	Stroke care during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: the experience of Spanish stroke units. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been heavily affected by COVID-19. Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate., RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak's peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established., CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care. As a consequence, some patients with stroke did not receive adequate treatment. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

0	Household transmission and incidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in symptomatic healthcare workers, clinical course and outcome: a French hospital experience. OBJECTIVES: Although healthcare workers (HCWs) have been particularly affected by SARS-CoV-2, detailed data remain scarce. In this study, we investigated infection rates, clinical characteristics, occupational exposure and household transmission among all symptomatic HCWs screened by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR between 17 March (French lockdown) and 20 April., METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was proposed to symptomatic (new cough or dyspnoea) HCWs at Creteil Hospital in one of the Parisian suburbs most severely affected by COVID-19. Data on occupational profile, living situation and household, together with self-isolation and mask use at home were collected, as well as the number of cases in the household., RESULTS: The incidence rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 5% (110/2188). A total of 110 (35%) of the 314 HCWs tested positive and 9 (8%) were hospitalised. On multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with positive RT-PCR were occupational profile with direct patient facing (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 8.8), p<0.03), and presence of anosmia (OR 5.7, 95% CI 3.1 to 10.6), p<0.0001). Being a current smoker was associated with negative RT-PCR (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7), p=0.005). Transmission from HCWs to household members was reported in 9 (14%) cases, and 2 deaths occurred. Overall, self-isolation was possible in 52% of cases, but only 31% of HCWs were able to wear a mask at home., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report infection rates among HCWs during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France and the lockdown period, highlighting the risk related to occupational profile and household transmission.

0	Emergency Orthopaedic surgery in the pandemic era: A case series at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Introduction: Every emergency surgery performed is aimed at saving lives; however, during COVID-19 pandemic, surgeries are often postponed. Many existing recommendations take into account postponing surgery during a pandemic. How these surgeries can lead to increasing infection rates has not been widely published. This study aims to investigate the relationship of emergency orthopaedic surgery and the incidence rate of COVID-19., Presentation of case: : This was a case series of 14 patients. The study was performed at the emergency department unit at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. A total of 14 patients underwent orthopaedic surgery in the emergency room of our institution. The mean age of the subjects was 40.07 +/- 20.5 years. Twelve (85.7%) were male patients and 2 (14.3%) were female patients. The average duration of surgery was 125 minutes. The most used type of anaesthesia was general anaesthesia for 6 operations (50%). Patients were hospitalized for an average length of 4 days. Three patients had infiltrates found on plain x-ray examination, which required further examination to determine whether the cause was COVID-19 infection or not. There was no ground glass appearance (GGO) in the three patients in further follow-up examination., Conclusions: We found that emergency orthopaedic surgery was not associated with increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Factors including duration of surgery, length of stay, types of anaesthesia and comorbidities were also not associated with COVID-19 cases in this study.

0	SARS-CoV-2-Induced Kawasaki-like hyperinflammatory syndrome: A novel COVID phenotype in children. We describe 2 children with persistent fever and profuse diarrhea who developed signs of mucocutaneous involvement (conjunctivitis, fissured lips, skin rash, erythema, and edema of the hands and feet). Blood tests revealed elevated markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and complement consumption. Afterward, diffuse edema with hypoalbuminemia appeared in the context of a capillary leak syndrome. In both patients, repeated nasal swabs were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but each patient had high titers of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The negative PCR results in the presence of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G suggested that the inflammatory response developed in the late phase of viral infection, when SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in the upper airway. In this report, we describe patients with what we propose to name as SARS-CoV-2-induced Kawasaki-like hyperinflammatory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2-induced Kawasaki-like hyperinflammatory syndrome seems to be caused by a delayed response to SARS-CoV-2. It resembles Kawasaki disease complicated by macrophage activation syndrome, although it has peculiar features, such as prodromal diarrhea, capillary leak syndrome, and myocardial dysfunction. Intravenous corticosteroid treatment appears to be helpful.Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.	false
0	Involvement of aminopeptidase N (CD13) in infection of human neural cells by human coronavirus 229E. Attachment to a cell surface receptor Can be a major determinant of virus tropism. Previous studies have shown that human respiratory coronavirus HCV-229E uses human aminopeptidase N (hAPN [CD13]) as its cellular receptor for infection of lung fibroblasts. Although human coronaviruses are recognized respiratory pathogens, occasional reports have suggested their possible neurotropism. We have previously shown that human neural cells, including glial cells in primary cultures, are susceptible to human coronavirus infection in vitro (A. Bonavia, N. Arbour, V. W. Yong, and P. J. Talbot, J. Virol. 71:800-806, 1997). However, the only reported expression of hAPN in the nervous system is at the level of nerve synapses. Therefore, we asked whether hAPN is utilized as a cellular receptor for infection of these human neural cell lines. Using flow cytometry, we were able to show the expression of hAPN on the surfaces of various human neuronal and glial cell lines that are susceptible to HCV-229E infection. An hAPN-specific monoclonal antibody (WM15), but not control antibody, inhibited the attachment of radiolabeled HCV-229E to astrocytic, neuronal, and oligodendrocytic cell lines. A correlation between the apparent amount of cell surface hAPN and the level of virus attachment was observed. Furthermore, the presence of WM15 inhibited virus infection of these cell lines, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. These results indicate that hAPN (CD13) is expressed on neuronal and glial cell lines in vitro and serves as the receptor for infection by HCV-229E. This further strengthens the neurotropic potential of this human respiratory virus.	false
0	Coronavirus JHM induced demyelinating disease: specific domains on the E2-protein are associated with neurovirulence. Infections of rodents by murine coronaviruses can lead to chronic diseases of the central nervous system. These infections are interesting systems to study mechanisms which could be relevant for the pathogenesis of certain human diseases. One major factor influencing the outcome of infection is related to the virus. To understand the virological basis for neurovirulence we compared JHM-virus isolates with different biological properties. JHM-Wt causes only acute disease, JHM-Ts43 a demyelinating encephalomyelitis and a virus shedded from persistently infected cells (JHM-Pi) is not virulent at all. The spread of these viruses in glial cell cultures reflects their different neurovirulence for animals. The peplomer E2 of these viruses reveals structural and antigenic differences. We characterised the epitopes of E2 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Four epitopes are associated with regions important for neutralisation, cell fusion and attachment. More than five epitopes are not related to such functions. Epitopes differ in their location and accessibility on the E2 protein subunits between JHM-Wt, JHM-Ts43 and JHM-Pi. To identify epitopes in regions important for pathogenesis, we performed animal studies with variants selected by monoclonal antibodies. Variants changed in a defined epitope (E2-Ba) induce in Balb/c mice a chronic disease. Variants changed in only one of the other three neutralisation epitopes induce acute disease. These results support and extend the observation that the peplomer protein E2 is a major determinant for virulence and antigenic variability of coronaviruses 1,4,5,6,8,10,17,19,22,23. Increasing evidence had been obtained that certain structural features of this protein are important for the cell tropism of the virus. Furthermore, this protein influences strongly the type and specificity of immune responses against viral and host antigens. The highly advanced knowledge on structure and replication of coronaviruses will be of great value to analyze further mechanisms leading to inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with a persistent virus infection.	false
0	Gastrointestinal symptoms and digestive comorbidities in an Italian cohort of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mainly involves respiratory symptoms, though gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly being recognized. In this context, the presence of comorbidities appears to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the role of digestive manifestations is not yet well defined. The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 compared to controls. The secondary aim was to determine the association of GI-symptoms and digestive comorbidities with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inpatients with COVID-19 and controls with similar symptoms and/or radiological findings were enrolled. Symptoms at admission and throughout hospitalization were collected as they were comorbidities. The measured clinical outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit admission and cumulative endpoint. RESULT(S): A total of 105 patients were included: 34 with COVID-19 and 71 controls. At admission, the prevalence of GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients was 8.8%. During hospitalization, the frequency of GI symptoms was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (p=0.004). Among patients with COVID-19, the mortality and a cumulative endpoint rates of those with GI symptoms were both lower than for those without GI symptoms (p=0.016 and p=0.000, respectively). Finally, we found digestive comorbidities to be associated with a milder course of COVID-19 (p=0.039 for cumulative endpoint). CONCLUSION(S): Our results highlighted the non-negligible frequency of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19, partly attributable to the therapies implemented. In addition, the presence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities is associated with better outcomes. Most likely, digestive comorbidities do not hinder the host's immune response against SARS-COV-2, and the occurrence of GI symptoms might be linked to a faster reduction of the viral load via the faecal route.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

0	Twin pregnant woman with COVID-19: A case report. A pregnant woman (Gravida 2, Abortion 1, twin pregnancy with microinjection, Gestational Age: 23 weeks and 3 days) was referred to a tertiary referral hospital with complaints of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. She was admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. During her hospitalization, O2 saturation progressively declined, which required acute respiratory care and support leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Gradual recovery occurred through treatment processes and finally the patient was extubated. However, there was another episode of respiratory failure leading to reintubation after 5 days. Meanwhile, serum liver enzymes increased significantly and leaded to intrauterine death of both fetus followed by a critical decline in cardiac output to less than 10% and cardiac arrest followed by unsuccessful resuscitation within hours.Copyright © 2020 Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Anesthesiology Research Center.

0	Unmasking Hypoxia in COVID 19 - Six Minute Walk Test. Across the world healthcare systems are dealing with COVID 19. One of the main manifestations of this infection is varied degree of involvement of lung causing a spectrum of illness from mild lower respiratory tract infection to severe Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). One of the important clinical parameters is to identify hypoxia early to initiate higher level of care at the earliest. However, presence of silent or latent hypoxia has made this task a challenge in COVID 19. A simple 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to look for inducible hypoxia for a patient who looks comfortable and is not hypoxic at rest, helps in early detection of hypoxia and initiating early higher-level care. The 6MWT also helps in looking for discharge preparedness of patient. This simple tool has immense clinical applicability to ensure safe care of COVID 19 patients.	false
0	Remodelling diabetes services and emerging innovation. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major international emergency leadin g to unprecedented medical, economic and societal challenges. Countries around the globe are facing chal lenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabete s suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient ser vices need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes present ing with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term har m caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-relate d complications. Outpatient management need to be reorganised to maintain remote advice and support services, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, and using telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-m anagement and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapi dly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communi cable vs non-communicable disease. Resulting challenges in clinical decision-making are compounded by a redu ced clinical workforce. For many years, increasing diabetes mellitus incidence has been mirrored by rising prevent able morbidity and mortality due to complications, yet innovation in service delivery has been slow. While the cur rent focus is on limiting the terrible harm caused by the pandemic, it is possible that a positive lasting legacy of COVID-19 might include accelerated innovation in chronic disease management.Copyright © 2020 BioScientifica Ltd..

0	The international European Academy of Neurology survey on neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection. Background and purpose: Although the main clinical features of COVID-19 infection are pulmonary, several associated neurological signs, symptoms and diseases are emerging. The incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID-19 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. Method(s): A 17-question online survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on 9 April 2020. Result(s): By 27 April 2020, proper data were collected from 2343 responders (out of 4199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID-19 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID-19 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (neuro COVID-19). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%) and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID-19; they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms and occurred at any time during infection. Conclusion(s): Neurologists are currently and actively involved in the management of neurological issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey justifies setting up a prospective registry to better capture the prevalence of patients with neuro COVID-19, neurological disease characteristics and the contribution of neurological manifestations to outcome.Copyright © 2020 European Academy of Neurology	false

0	Binding of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 to its receptor expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus depends on posttranslational processing of the receptor glycoprotein. Recently, we showed that a murine member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of glycoproteins serves as a cellular receptor (MHVR) for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991; R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). To examine the role of posttranscriptional modification of MHVR on virus-receptor interactions, a vaccinia virus-based expression system was employed. Expression from the vaccinia virus recombinant (Vac-MHVR) in BHK-21 cells resulted in high levels of MHVR glycoprotein on the cell surface and made these cells susceptible to MHV-A59 infection. Nonglycosylated core MHVR proteins were made in Vac-MHVR-infected BHK-21 cells in the presence of tunicamycin by in vitro translation of MHVR mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system in the absence of microsomal membranes and by expression of an N-terminal deletion clone of MHVR lacking its signal peptide. These three nonglycosylated MHVR proteins were recognized by polyclonal antibody against affinity-purified receptor but did not bind antireceptor monoclonal antibody (MAb) CC1 or MHV-A59 virions. Partial glycosylation of MHVR, either expressed in Vac-MHVR-infected cells treated with monensin or synthesized by in vitro translation with microsomal membranes, restored both the MAb CC1- and the virus-binding activities of the MHVR glycoprotein. Deletion of 26 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of MHVR resulted in a secreted protein which was able to bind MAb CC1 and MHV-A59. These results suggest that either a carbohydrate moiety is an element of the MHVR-binding site(s) for virus and MAb CC1 or a posttranslational membrane-associated process is required for functional conformation of the receptor glycoprotein.	false
0	Amino acid sequence of a conserved neutralizing epitope of murine coronaviruses. We identified the binding site of monoclonal antibody 19.2, which cross-neutralizes several mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains, inhibits fusion of MHV-infected cells, and protects against lethal infection (P.J. Talbot and M.J. Buchmeier, Virus Res. 2:317-328, 1985). We used fusion proteins, generated by expression of fragments of the MHV A59 E2 gene in pEX plasmids, and synthetic peptides in a PEPSCAN.	false

0	Clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients in the outdoor setting. In a brief span of a few months, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a major paradigm shift in operation of clinical services around the world. Infection may be mild, moderate or severe; many remain asymptomatic. High burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases theoretically puts Pakistani population at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Considering the universal risk of infection, the outpatient services in Pakistan need to be redesigned. Starting with risk assessment of the facility and provision of a dedicated telephone connection, structure and workflow need to be redesigned in order to minimise risk of exposure to healthcare professionals, staff and patients. Patients with COVID-19 patients should be identified before they arrive in the facility and should be served expeditiously, in an environment which prevents cross-transmission of infection. Tele-consultation is assuming an important role. Changes which are taking place in response to Covid-19 pandemic will have far reaching effects on clinical services in Pakistan.Copyright © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association.

0	Macrophage activation syndrome as an unusual presentation of paucisymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: A case report. RATIONALE: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare life-threatening condition characterized by cytokine-mediated tissue injury and multiorgan dysfunction. PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe the unique case of young man who developed MAS as the sole manifestation of an otherwise paucisymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. DIAGNOSES: Clinical and biological criteria led to the diagnosis of MAS; cytokine profile was highly suggestive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs was negative, but serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G resulted positive leading to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with empiric antibiotic and hydroxychloroquine. OUTCOME(S): Clinical improvement ensued. At follow-up, the patient is well. LESSON: SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger develop life-threatening complications, like MAS. This can be independent from coronavirus disease 2019 gravity.	false

0	COVID-19 Delirium with Psychosis: A Case Report. COVID-19 typically presents as severe pneumonia often requiring intubation and ICU management. Descriptions of the potential neurological symptoms in this disease state exist, but minimal research has been conducted on the prevalence of delirium. This case report describes a patient with no past psychiatric history who developed psychotic symptoms in the context of acute COVID-19 delirium. Clinicians should consider COVID-19 in their differential diagnosis with any patient who presents with psychotic symptoms, even in the absence of the typical COVID-19 symptoms of cough or fever. Rule out of COVID-19 via PCR should be completed on any new delirium case, and appropriate isolation of psychiatric patients should occur until negative results are obtained.Copyright© South Dakota State Medical Association.	false
0	Commercial Serology Assays Predict Neutralization Activity Against SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether a positive serology result correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. METHOD(S): A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULT(S): The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): These three clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. All SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients develop neutralizing antibodies.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.	false
0	Absence of infection in asymptomatic contacts of index SARS case in France. The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in France was diagnosed in March 2003. We conducted a serological survey to assess whether or not asymptomatic persons who had been in contact with this patient during his infectious stage had been infected. They were interviewed and asked to provide a blood sample for SARS coronavirus immunoglobulin G antibody testing. Despite the likely high infectivity of the SARS patient, no asymptomatic SARS infection was found in any of the 37 contacts included. These findings support a SARS case definition that is essentially based on clinical and epidemiological assessment, should SARS re-emerge.	false
0	"Systematic evaluation of transcriptomic disease risk and diagnostic biomarker overlap between COVID-19 and tuberculosis: a patient-level meta-analysis. Background: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has increased the burden on healthcare systems already strained by a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) as co-infection and dual presentation are occurring in syndemic settings. We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals., Methods: We performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB), PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature. Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these signatures. Putative ""COVID-19 risk scores"" were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19 disease severity states., Results: 35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0.005), 13 of which were validated in two independent datasets. FCN1 - and SPP1 -expressing macrophages enriched in BALF during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of co-infection., Interpretation: Our results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."	false
0	Subcorneal pustular dermatosis with temporary autoimmune features during COVID-19 pandemic. Subcorneal pustular dermatosis, Sneddon-Wilkinson, is an uncommon neutrophilic dermatosis of unknown etiology. We report on a 51-year-old woman who presented with multiple superficial erythematous erosions surrounded by annular arranged sterile pustules concentrated on the trunk, the neck, and the proximal extremities during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. Larges pustules and flaccid bullae showed a hypopyon. There were no fever and no pruritus, general health was unaffected. Laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and increased C-reactive protein. Initially, antinuclear antibodies, pemphigoid antibodies, and antibodies to BP 230 were positive, but negative 5 days later. Nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A diagnostic skin biopsy showed epidermal spongiotic vesiculation and subcorneal pustulation with acantholysis and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils and lymphocytes. The confirmed diagnosis was subcorneal pustular dermatosis Sneddon-Wilkinson. She was treated by dapsone and corticosteroids with the latter tempered down. Clinical response was rapid. We suggest that the autoimmune features seen on admission may be due to an undefined viral infection, but not SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Uwe Wollina, Andre Koch.	false
0	Epidemiology and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults. A number of patients with pneumonitis infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been detected since December 2019. The initial reported patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and children had low incidence and were not susceptible. As the number of children infected gradually increased, the infection spread to premature babies, infants and young children, and severe cases in children have now occurred. Susceptibility characteristics of the entire population have been identified in the latest diagnosis and treatment plan. At present, the proportion of children affected by the disease is relatively low, but it still deserves enough attention. The epidemiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults is unclear, and there is no specific drug for treatment, which brings great difficulties to epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment. Early identification of epidemiological characteristics and effective treatment with drugs are the key to preventing and controlling this new epidemic. This article analyzes the pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic in children and adults, differences in the incidence, and the current status of treatment. Last it explores possible causes and possible effective treatment measures.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences). All right reserved.	false
0	Serum pooling for rapid expansion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing capacity. OBJECTIVES: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity., METHODS: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches., RESULTS: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors. Copyright © 2020.

0	SELF-LIMITED COVID-19 INFECTION IN ARTEMIS HYPOMORPHIC SCID: ARE B CELLS DISPENSABLE?. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causes variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic disease to immune dysregulation and multi-organ failure. The immunologic features of COVID-19 are incompletely understood. From reports of resolved COVID-19 infection in patients with primary antibody deficiency, it has been postulated that B cells may be dispensable for immunologic clearance. Case Description: A 14-month-old female patient with compound heterozygous mutation (maternal deletion and paternal missense mutation) in DCLRE1C (Artemis) presented on day 2 of illness with rhinorrhea, congestion, cough, and transient fever. She was PCR-positive for SARS-CoV2. Prior immunophenotyping showed normal NK cell numbers, near-absent B cells (CD19+ 42), T cell lymphopenia (CD3+ 743), declining phytohemagglutinin mitogen testing (last 37% of control), and polyclonal T-cell repertoire, consistent with the diagnosis of hypomorphic severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Admission workup demonstrated lymphopenia (ALC 720); normal CRP; elevations in IFN-gamma (40.5), IL-8 (19.7), and TNF-alpha (5.8); and minimal Burr cells with no schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. She was discharged after 36 hours of observation. Discussion(s): Given this patient's unclear clinical trajectory at presentation, the decision was made to admit for further evaluation. Remarkably, despite T cell dysfunction and near-absence of B cells, she improved without medical intervention. This outcome lends credence to the notion that B cells may be dispensable for clinical resolution of COVID-19 infection. Further elucidation of immune responses to SARS-CoV2 will benefit from continued surveillance of clinical outcomes in patients with defined immunologic deficits.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Tinnitus and equilibrium disorders in COVID-19 patients: preliminary results. Purpose: Tinnitus and equilibrium disorders such as dizziness and vertigo have been reported by patients with COVID-19; however, they have been rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to study the prevalence of subjective tinnitus and dizziness in a sample of COVID-19 patients using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire. Method(s): A multicentric study that included 15 Italian hospitals in different regions was conducted using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire developed to identify the presence of tinnitus and balance disorders in patients with COVID-19 between May 5 and June 10, 2020. The questionnaire was administered to 185 patients in a period of > 30 - < 60 days after diagnosis of COVID-19; responses were recorded in an online Excel spreadsheet. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (1) demographic information; (2) presence and characteristics of tinnitus and dizziness after COVID-19 diagnosis; (3) possible association with migraine. Result(s): Thirty-four patients (18.4%) reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19 diagnosis. Of these, 32 patients reported dizziness (94.1%) and 2 (5.9%) reported acute vertigo attacks. Forty-three patients (23.2%) reported tinnitus; 14 (7.6%) reported both tinnitus and equilibrium disorders. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the presence of subjective otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus and balance disorders can affect COVID-19 patients; further studies are necessary to investigate the prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these subjective symptoms in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	World record extreme sea surface temperatures in the northwestern Arabian/Persian Gulf verified by in situ measurements. The Arabian or Persian Gulf is recognized as one of the warmest estuaries globally. The sea surface temperature (SST) has been utilized in several studies to gauge the global warming associated with climate change. In the current investigation we present detailed in situ SST measurements for five consecutive years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) in the northwest of the Gulf, specifically in Kuwait Bay. Results of data analyses were compared with the historical records for the region, revealing that the SST reached an extreme level never previously recorded either in the Gulf. The extreme SST in Kuwait Bay reached 37.6 degreeC, recorded by the offshore station KISR01 located in the middle of the Bay. The event was associated with heatwave, neap tides, and an extended period of Kous winds which are characterized by high humidity levels and accompanied by large-scale intermittent fish kill incidents that extended the full length of the Kuwait coastline. Several fish kill incidents were reported also at the northern edge of the Gulf along Shatt Al Arab stretch in Iraq.

The records presented in this study may provide evidence to the effects of global warming, aid further research, and encourage the concerned international government bodies to deliver urgent environmental policies.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak and the emergency public health measures in Bosnia and Herzegovina: January - July, 2020. Between March 5th and July 25th, 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was 10,090, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 285.7/100,000 population. Demographic and clinical information on all the cases along with exposure and contact information were collected using a standardized case report form. In suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, respiratory specimens were collected and tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. The dynamic of the outbreak was summarized using epidemiological curves, instantaneous reproduction number Rt, and interactive choropleth maps for geographical distribution and spread. The rate of hospitalization was 14.0%(790/5646) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) and 6.2% (267/4299) in the Republic of Srpska (RS). The death rate was 2.2% (122/5646) in FBH and 3.6% in the RS (155/4299). After the authorities lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions, the instantaneous reproduction number increased from 1.13 on May 20th to 1.72 on May 31st. The outbreak concerns both entities, FBH and RS, and it is more pronounced in those aged 20-44 years. It is important to develop the communication and emergency plan for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in BH, including the mechanisms to allow the ongoing notification and updates at the national level.	false
0	Screening policies, preventive measures and in-hospital infection of COVID-19 in global surgical practices. Background: In a surgical setting, COVID-19 patients may trigger in-hospital outbreaks and have worse postoperative outcomes. Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide., Methods: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers' experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country's cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100)., Results: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries., Conclusions: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice. More intensive screening programs will be necessary particularly in severely affected countries/institutions., Study registration: Registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04344197.

0	"The diagnostic value of joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV in 2019-nCoV infection. Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in 2019-nCoV infection. Method(s): This is a retrospective study. Serum samples were collected from 284 patients including outpatients and inpatients in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20 to February 17 in 2020. Among them 205 cases were 2019-nCoV infected patients, including 186 cases confirmed with nucleic acid test and 19 cases diagnosed by clinical symptoms and CT characteristics according to ""the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Control Protocol (5th edition)"". A total of 79 subjects with other diseases but negative to 2019-nCoV infection were recruited as control group. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were measured with fully automated immunoassay technology for all subjects. Statistical significance between 2019-nCoV antibodies test and 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was determined using the chi2 tests. Result(s): The sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were 70.24%(144/205) and 96.10%(197/205) respectively and the specificity were 96.20%(76/79) and 92.41%(73/79) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV antibodies were 95.63%(197/206) and 91.03% (71/78) respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were 100%(186/186) and 80.61%(79/98) respectively. The total coincidence rate of diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection between antibody tests and nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV were 88.03%(250/284). Conclusion(s): Joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV is an effective screening and diagnostic indicators for 2019-nCoV infection, and an effective complement to the false negative results to nucleic acid test.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association."	false
0	The Transport Medicine Society Consensus Guidelines for the Transport of Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared as a pandemic. COVID-19 patients may require transport for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes intra- or interhospital or transport from an outside hospital to a healthcare facility. Transport of critically ill or infectious patients is always challenging and involves the integration of various tasks and manpower. The adverse events have been attributed to various factors such as a multidisciplinary team and lack of appropriate communication among team members, absence of equipment, or failure during transport, apart from physiological alteration inherent to the disease of the patient. The transport of COVID-19 patients carries an additional risk of not only the disease itself but also due to the risk of its transmission to the transport team. The human-to-human transmission of the virus can occur via respiratory droplets. So, the person involved in the transport of such patients shall be at risk and warrants appropriate steps for their safety. Appropriate planning by a well-trained transport team is an essence for the safe transport of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. The Transport Medicine Society guidelines present consensus guidelines for the safe transport of COVID-19 patients., Disclaimer: These consensus guidelines are applicable for the safe transport of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 adult patients. These recommendations should be used in conjunction with medical management guidelines and advisories related to COVID-19. These recommendations should be adapted to the local policies prevalent at the workplace and also per agreement among the hospitals for transport (agreement between referring and receiving facilities). With the emergence of new scientific evidence, these guidelines may require modification., How to cite this article: Munjal M, Ahmed SM, Garg R, Das S, Chatterjee N, Mittal K, et al.

0	The hidden positive effects of covid-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus disease spread like fire, and millions of cases have been reported worldwide, and thousands have died. So, many countries around the globe ordered lockdown to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, which caused significant economic fallout. But every incident has two aspects, positive and negative. This article aimed to study the positive effects of COVID-19 pandemic on some specific factors and to study this topic, datais collected from various websites, web blogs, newspapers and reports on the internet. This pandemic enforced the cancellation or postponement of multiple events, which leads to a reduction in travelling and subsequently there were fewer vehicles on the road, which leads to a decrease in air and water pollution. Road traffic accidents and crime rate had come down suddenly. Due to lockdown, there was a reduction in transportation and industrial activity which allowed Mother Nature to recharge and replenish. Due to lockdown, people spent quality time with their family, fulfilled their hobbies, learnt many new skills and understood the importance of sanitation, hand hygiene and social distancing. This pandemic is a lesson for us to learn many new things. This crisis revealed that there is a need to improve our healthcare system and clinical researches. Immunity of an individual can play an important role to fight these kinds of viral diseases, and these diseases can be avoided by simply following the basic concepts of the Ayurveda. This lockdown showed the short-term depletion in greenhouse gas emissions, but this is not an option for long-lasting climate change, and we have to think about a sustainable solution to save the environment.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false
0	Targeting SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain by Therapeutic Antibodies. As the number of people infected with the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is continuously increasing every day, development of potential therapeutic platforms is vital. Based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, it seems crucial to assay the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with SARS-CoV2 spike (S)-protein. Indeed, developing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope-specific vaccines (ESV). Herein, we present an overview on the discovery of new CoV followed by some explanation on the SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD site. Furthermore, we surveyed the novel therapeutic mAbs for targeting S-protein RBD such as S230, 80R, F26G18, F26G19, CR3014, CR3022, M396, and S230.15. Afterwards, the mechanism of interaction of RBD and different mAbs were explained and it was suggested that one of the SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs, namely CR3022, could show the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for rapid and sensitive advancement of therapeutic mAbs targeting S-protein RBD were discussed. In conclusion, it may be proposed that this review may pave the way for recognition of RBD and different mAbs to develop potential therapeutic ESV.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Supplemental oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The world has experienced a pandemic due to novel Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV2) since December 2019. The clinical spectrum of the disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is so much wide, starting from an asymptomatic state to paucisymptomatic clinical presentation, pneumonia, respiratory failure to even death. Supplemental oxygen therapy is essential in managing COVID-19. Also, there is sparse evidence regarding use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in pandemics like SARS-CoV-2. This study reviews the currently available methods for respiratory support in COVID-19 with a discussion about using these modalieties in the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Anesthesiology Research Center.

0	Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using electrochemical impedance-based detector. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has caused over 550,000 deaths worldwide as of July 2020. Accurate and scalable point-of-care devices would increase screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Here, we demonstrate rapid label-free electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a commercially available impedance sensing platform. A 16-well plate containing sensing electrodes was pre-coated with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and subsequently tested with samples of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody CR3022 (0.1 mug/ml, 1.0 mug/ml, 10 mug/ml). Subsequent blinded testing was performed on six serum specimens taken from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (1:100 dilution factor). The platform was able to differentiate spikes in impedance measurements from a negative control (1% milk solution) for all CR3022 samples. Further, successful differentiation and detection of all positive clinical samples from negative control was achieved. Measured impedance values were consistent when compared to standard ELISA test results showing a strong correlation between them (R2=0.9). Detection occurs in less than five minutes and the well-based platform provides a simplified and familiar testing interface that can be readily adaptable for use in clinical settings.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Incidence, Characteristics, and Outcome of COVID-19 in Adults on Kidney Replacement Therapy: A Regionwide Registry Study. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disproportionally affects frail, elderly patients and those with multiple chronic comorbidities. Whether patients on RRT have an additional risk because of their specific exposure and complex immune dysregulation is controversial., METHODS: To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 2 to May 25, 2020. This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., RESULTS: At the end of the epidemic wave, crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5.3% versus 2.5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 1.4% versus 1.6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants (compared with 0.6% in the general population). Crude and age-standardized cumulative mortality rates were 29.6% versus 19.9%, respectively, among patients on hemodialysis, and 14.0% versus 23.0%, respectively, among patients with transplants (compared with 15.3% in the general population). We found no excess mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients. Only 0.18% of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT. Nevertheless, the epidemic's overall effect on the RRT population remained remarkably limited in Flanders. Calculation of excess mortality and age standardization provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden of COVID-19 among patients on RRT.

0	Guidance for rebooting electrophysiology through the COVID-19 pandemic from the Heart Rhythm Society and the American Heart Association Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology: Endorsed by the American College o. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented substantial challenges to patient care and impacted health care delivery, including cardiac electrophysiology practice throughout the globe. Based upon the undetermined course and regional variability of the pandemic, there is uncertainty as to how and when to resume and deliver electrophysiology services for arrhythmia patients. This joint document from representatives of the Heart Rhythm Society, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology seeks to provide guidance for clinicians and institutions reestablishing safe electrophysiological care. To achieve this aim, we address regional and local COVID-19 disease status, the role of viral screening and serologic testing, return-to-work considerations for exposed or infected health care workers, risk stratification and management strategies based on COVID-19 disease burden, institutional preparedness for resumption of elective procedures, patient preparation and communication, prioritization of procedures, and development of outpatient and periprocedural care pathways.Copyright © 2020 The Heart Rhythm Society, the American Heart Association, Inc., and the American College of Cardiology Foundation	false
0	Development and Evaluation of a Duo SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Assay Combining Two Assays Approved by the World Health Organization Targeting the Envelope and the RNA-Dependant RNA Polymerase (RdRp) Coding Regions. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide has highlighted the importance of reliable and rapid diagnostic testing to prevent and control virus circulation. Dozens of monoplex in-house RT-qPCR assays are already available; however, the development of dual-target assays is suited to avoid false-negative results caused by polymorphisms or point mutations, that can compromise the accuracy of diagnostic and screening tests. In this study, two mono-target assays recommended by WHO (E-Sarbeco (enveloppe gene, Charite University, Berlin, Germany) and RdRp-IP4 (RdRp, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France)) were selected and combined in a unique robust test; the resulting duo SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay was compared to the two parental monoplex tests. The duo SARS-CoV-2 assay performed equally, or better, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, linearity and signal intensity. We demonstrated that combining two single systems into a dual-target assay (with or without an MS2-based internal control) did not impair performances, providing a potent tool adapted for routine molecular diagnosis in clinical microbiology laboratories.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	Morphogenesis and cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human airway epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2, a beta-coronavirus, has rapidly spread across the world, highlighting its high transmissibility, but the underlying morphogenesis and pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the replication dynamics, cell tropism and morphogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in organotypic human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently and infects both ciliated and secretory cells in HAE cultures. In comparison, HCoV-NL63 replicates to lower titers and is only detected in ciliated cells. SARS-CoV-2 shows a similar morphogenetic process as other coronaviruses but causes plaque-like cytopathic effects in HAE cultures. Cell fusion, apoptosis, destruction of epithelium integrity, cilium shrinking and beaded changes are observed in the plaque regions. Taken together, our results provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism, replication and morphogenesis.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Monoclonal antibodies to the peplomer glycoprotein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus identify two subunits and detect a conformational change in the subunit released under mild alkaline conditions. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the E2 glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been classified according to their ability to bind to either of the two purified 90,000-molecular-weight subunits (90K subunits) of the 180K peplomeric glycoprotein E2. Correlation with previously reported information about these MAbs suggests that both of the subunits of E2 are important for viral infectivity and cell fusion. Incubation of trypsin-treated virions at pH 8.0 and 37degreeC released only the E2(N) subunit from virions. The pattern of MAb reactions suggested that a conformational change occurred in the E2(N) subunit in association with its release from virions under mildly alkaline conditions at 37degreeC, the same conditions which are optimal for coronavirus-induced cell fusion.	false

0	Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis during Covid-19 pandemic. Background: The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objective(s): To determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of the studied event (HAIE) during the study period was calculated by Poisson distribution. Result(s): Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.3/patient-month during the same calender months in the previous 5 years (p=0.033). Two cases presented during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with methylprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. Two patients died during hospital admission. Conclusion(s): The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	High-dose prednisone for treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patient: Male, 53-year-old Final Diagnosis: Autoimmune pancreatitis type 1 * COVID-19 Symptoms: Abdominal and/or epigastric pain * fever Medication: - Clinical Procedure: - Specialty: Gastroenterology and Hepatology * Infectious Diseases Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a rare, steroid-responsive disease of the pancreas. Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids, increases the risk of developing a severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) advises against the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 due to their poor outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), unless these patients require steroid treatment for a coexisting disease. Case Report: A 53-year old patient was admitted with symptoms and diagnostic findings consistent with AIP. Thorough eti-ological workup revealed an elevated IgG4 level of 361 mg/dL and significant clinical response to corticosteroid treatment, leading to a diagnosis of AIP. After finishing steroid treatment at home, the patient was readmitted with another episode of AIP complicated by development of acute necrotic collection and COVID-19 while tak-ing a second course of high dose prednisone. The patient was continued on high dose prednisone, started on azathioprine and intravenous meropenem, and underwent CT guided percutaneous drainage. He also received supportive care for COVID-19. After significant clinical improvement, the patient was discharged to quarantine at home, which he completed uneventfully. Conclusion(s): Despite the use of corticosteroids due to AIP, this high risk patient recovered from COVID-19 without compli-cations. These findings support the use of corticosteroids when necessary for treatment of coexisting conditions in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © Am J Case Rep.	false

0	Onset of Ketosis-Prone Diabetes in the Setting of COVID-19 Infection. Diabetic ketoacidosis is typically associated with type I diabetes mellitus, but it can be associated with type II diabetes mellitus under the conditions of extreme stress or as a presenting manifestation of ketosis-prone type II diabetes mellitus. A 38-year-old prediabetic male presented to the emergency room with hyperglycemia six weeks after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Laboratory results showed severe hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, positive ketones in urine and blood, and elevated fasting C- peptide level. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were positive. The workup was completely unremarkable for acute infection. Hemoglobin A1C increased from 6.1% to 10.8% within six weeks. The mechanism by which COVID-19 infection may trigger the onset of full-blown diabetes mellitus remains unknown. Viral infection may cause the direct destruction of pancreatic beta cells or trigger the changes in the body that induce the state of insulin resistance. Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may cross-react or interfere with the functioning of endogenous insulin. The association between type II diabetes and COVID-19 infections needs additional investigations to ascertain the exact mechanism by which COVID-19 infection triggers the onset of full-blown diabetes mellitus.

0	Reinfection of COVID-19 after 3 months with a distinct and more aggressive clinical presentation: case report. The sudden pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 exposed healthcare professionals worldwide to high viral loads, in an early epidemiological moment, often without the recommended personal protective equipment. We report the case of a Brazilian doctor who, after presenting a mild clinical episode of COVID-19 with molecular confirmation by RT-PCR in March 2020, appeared with a new acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 three months later. In middle of June, she had significant and very specific symptoms of COVID-19 with tomographic and serological confirmation of reinfection. There is a strong probability that these two episodes of infection were caused by different viral strains and that each genetic variation is related to specific clinical manifestations. We observed that, in addition to the different symptoms presented in the reinfections' episode, there was a more intense organic inflammatory response to the virus, with clinical repercussion. This clinical case should be an alert regarding the maintenance of individual protection among health cares, even in individuals who have already had COVID-19, since there is still no guarantee of prolonged immunity.

0	Recovery from critical covid-19 despite delays in diagnosis and respiratory treatment: A cautionary tale. Although an acute, usually self-resolving disease, COVID-19 can also be deadly. Thus far, no approved specific treatments for this novel highly contagious disease are available, which posed great challenges on clinicians worldwide. Here we present the case of a relatively young COVID-19 patient who recovered well, despite delayed diagnosis and initiation of aggressive treatment. From the case, we speculated that: (a) Delayed diagnosis may miss the optimal antiviral treatment period for severe cases. (b) Monitoring of inflammatory markers and blood gas analysis in early stage may assist in identifying high-risk patients. (c) Glucocorticoids therapy in early stage may be harmful to the patient. (d) Once progressed to ARDS, mechanical ventilatory support should be considered as soon as possible in case of refractory hypoxemia. (e) ECMO, a scarce medical resource, should not be abused to treat COVID-19 patients with very low expected survival rates, especially during the period when medical resources are run out. (f) convalescent plasma therapy should be initiated in earlier stage of disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	Recommendations guide for the management of pediatric patients with severe SARS-COV-2. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 and its rapid expansion in the world reaching Pandemic status, has become a great challenge for health teams. Although the evidence of infection in children is still scarce compared to that of adults, it has become evident that at the pediatric po-pulation level, most of the time the infection is asymptomatic or mild, but not all the patients have this evolution, which has motivated the discussion in the Pediatric Critical Care teams regarding how to face these patients with a more serious disease. This consensus is the result of the work of the Pediatric Intensive Care Branch of the Chilean Society of Pediatrics, collecting the evidence available at the time of the review plus the opinion of national experts in Pediatric Intensive Care. The purpose of these recommendations is to offer teams that care for critically ill pediatric patients a guide for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who evolve with severe COVID 19, which can be applied in all Pediatric UPCs in our country, with special emphasis in those measures that have shown greater effectiveness at the level of diagnostic studies, treatment and care of health personnel.Copyright © 2020, Sociedad Chilena de Pediatria.

0	Reaction to a Pandemic: Social Distancing and Driving Among Older Adults During COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide, and older adults are at especially high risk for developing severe COVID-19. A cohort study of driving behavior from January 1, 2019, to April 25, 2019, and January 1, 2020, to April 25, 2020, was conducted. We hypothesized that older adults would reduce the number of days driving and number of trips/day they make after COVID-19 case acceleration. Data from 214 adults aged 66.5 to 92.8 years were used. Women comprised 47.6% of the sample and 15.4% were African American. Participants reduced the proportion of days driven during the pandemic (.673 vs.382 [p <.001]) compared with same period the year before (.695 vs.749). Trips/day showed a similar decline (p <.001). Participants also took shorter trips (p =.02), drove slower (p <.001), had fewer speeding incidents (p <.001), and had different trip destinations (p <.001). These results indicate that older adults reduce their driving behavior when faced with a pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification. BACKGROUND: Rapid, reliable, and widespread testing is required to curtail the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor., METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples., RESULTS: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using three readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had accuracies greater than 90%., CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19.

0	Preventive measures for dental professionals during worldwide emergency COVID-19. Coronavirus (CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading viral infection all over the world. World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 as the pandemic disease. Pro-fessionally, Dentists are prone to get the cross-infection. And are at 100% risk. This is because Dentists come across face to face communication with the patients, frequent exposure to saliva, blood, other body fluids while handling the teeth and sharp instruments. So, precautionary and preventive measures should be taken to prevent and minimize the cross-infection and spread of COVID-19. The susceptible people of COVID-19 are those who had a travel history from abroad, elderly people, immuno-compromised, and people with co-morbidities. This condition is more prevalent in males when compared to females. Transmission can be broadly divided into the direct and indi-rect transmission. In general, a COVID infected patient shows signs of symp-toms like fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, body pain, lethargy, and breathlessness. At present, no cure or vaccine has been discovered. Cur-rently, a combination of anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs is being used to treat patients. Simultaneously, multi-vitamins and Hydroxychloroquine is administered to most susceptible patients after consulting the physician. Prevention for aerosol, body fluids, nasal discharge is a must. Disinfection of sur-rounding and personal protective wear, which includes a face shield, mask, gown, head cap, double gloving, and glasses, should be worn by healthcare professionals to limit the contact to the virus. Social distancing is a must to control the transmission of this disease.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false
0	No evidence for quasispecies populations during persistence of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus JHM: Sequence conservation within the surface glycoprotein gene S in Lewis rats. The surface glycoprotein S (spike) of coronaviruses is believed to be an important determinant of virulence and displays extensive genetic polymorphism in cell culture isolates. This led us to consider whether the observed heterogeneity is reflected by a quasispecies distribution of mutated RNA molecules within the infected organ. Coronavirus infection of rodents is a useful model system for investigating the pathogenesis of virus-induced central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we investigated whether genetic changes in the S gene occurred during virus persistence in vivo. We analysed the variability of S gene sequences directly from the brain tissue of Lewis rats infected with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant JHM-Pi using RT-PCR amplification methods. The S gene sequence displayed a remarkable genetic stability in vivo. No evidence for a quasispecies distribution was found by sequence analysis of amplified S gene fragments derived from the CNS of Lewis rats. Furthermore, the S gene also remained conserved under the selection pressure of a neutralizing antibody. Only a few mutations predicted to result in amino acid changes were detected in single clones. The changes were not represented in the consensus sequence. These results indicate that to retain functional proteins under the constraints of a persistent infection in vivo, conservation of sequence can be more important than heterogeneity.	false
0	Esperienza clinica e criticit. Bergamo is a rich and populous city of northern Italy and one of the epicentres of the worldwide pandemic CoViD-19. Despite the generosity of health workers, we are undergoing a severe humanitarian crisis that is stressing every aspect of daily life. From outside it is very hard to understand, because houses are closed for lockdown and are not destroyed as they would be in an earthquake. An outbreak is not only a sudden mass lethal incident, like a natural disaster, neither only a disease, to be treated by doctors, but a social phenomenon too. Historical and social elements are key factors for development (for example, intensive promiscuity between animals and humans) and spread of an epidemic (for example, health workers and ambulance rapidly become vector of the virus). Can medical responsibility change in times of pandemic? My answer, as anaesthetist and intensive care physician from Bergamo, is yes. When the global medical community is called on to face a pandemic of unprecedented scale, with little scientific evidence and crazy numbers describing the situation, honest and forthcoming advocacy is an ethical duty. Aim of this narrative report is to share a view point about the dilemma of moral responsibility.Copyright © 2020 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Erythrocyte, Platelet, Serum Ferritin, and P-Selectin Pathophysiology Implicated in Severe Hypercoagulation and Vascular Complications in COVID-19. Progressive respiratory failure is seen as a major cause of death in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection. Relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the circulation of these patients. In particular, platelet and erythrocyte pathology might result in severe vascular issues, and the manifestations may include thrombotic complications. These thrombotic pathologies may be both extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary and may be central to respiratory failure. Previously, we reported the presence of amyloid microclots in the circulation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigate the presence of related circulating biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and P-selectin. These biomarkers are well-known to interact with, and cause pathology to, platelets and erythrocytes. We also study the structure of platelets and erythrocytes using fluorescence microscopy (using the markers PAC-1 and CD62PE) and scanning electron microscopy. Thromboelastography and viscometry were also used to study coagulation parameters and plasma viscosity. We conclude that structural pathologies found in platelets and erythrocytes, together with spontaneously formed amyloid microclots, may be central to vascular changes observed during COVID-19 progression, including thrombotic microangiopathy, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and large-vessel thrombosis, as well as ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Consequently, this clinical snapshot of COVID-19 strongly suggests that it is also a true vascular disease and considering it as such should form an essential part of a clinical treatment regime.	false
0	Robust and Specific Secretory IgA Against SARS-CoV-2 Detected in Human Milk. The SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk has not yet been examined, although protecting infants and young children from COVID-19 is critical for limiting community transmission and preventing serious illness and death. Here, milk samples from eight COVID-19-recovered and seven COVID-19-suspected donors were tested for antibody (Ab) binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. All samples exhibited significant specific IgA reactivity to the full Spike, whereas 80% exhibited significant IgA and secretory (s)Ab binding to the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Additionally, 67% samples exhibited IgG and/or IgM binding to RBD. IgA and sAb titers were highly correlated, indicating most IgA to be sIgA. Overall, these data indicate that a robust sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in human milk after infection should be expected in a significant majority of individuals. Further research is highly warranted to determine Ab functionality and the potential for exploiting extracted milk sIgA for therapeutic use. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false

0	Retrospective analysis of Chinese epidemic situation model based on elbow cluster analysis. Objective * To explore the correlation patterns of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in various provincial administrative regions in China at the early stage of the epidemic, and forecast the following development of epidemic situation. Methods * The data on the COVID-19 epidemic situation in various provincial administrative regions in China published by National Health Commission of People's Republic of China from Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. The elbow cluster analysis method was used to cluster the provincial administrative regions. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model was used to calculate the basic infection number (R0) of different clusters, whose changing trends were also predicted. Results * According to the prevalence rates, the 34 provincial administrative regions were divided into four types of clusters: Cluster (22 provincial administrative regions), Cluster II (9 provincial administrative regions), Cluster III (2 provincial administrative regions) and Cluster (Hubei). The prevalence rate of Hubei was higher than those of other clusters (P=0.000), but the differences in the cure rate and the case-fatality rate among the four clusters were not statistically significant; the R0 values based on the SEIR model of them were 2.764, 3.056, 3.899 and 3.984, respectively. By Feb. 13, 2020, except for Hubei, the cumulative prevalence curves of the other clusters tended to be stable and the cure rates increased. The prevalence rate and case-fatality rate of Hubei were still higher, and the cure rate was lower. Conclusion * From Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, 34 provincial administrative regions in China can be divided into four clusters according to the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the prevalence rate of Cluster was significantly higher than those of other three clusters; by Feb. 13, 2020, the epidemic situations in the Cluster , II and III has been alleviated, and the epidemic situation in Cluster areas were still severe.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

0	Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality in Older Patients With COVID-19: The COVIDAge Study. OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19 in older patients., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19., METHODS: Data from hospital admission were collected from the electronic medical records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict mortality, our primary outcome. Variables at hospital admission were categorized according to the following domains: demographics, clinical history, comorbidities, previous treatment, clinical status, vital signs, clinical scales and scores, routine laboratory analysis, and imaging results., RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 43% were male, with a mean age of 86 +/- 6.5 years. Seventy-six patients (32%) died. Nonsurvivors had a shorter number of days from initial symptoms to hospitalization (P = .007) and the length of stay in acute wards than survivors (P < .001). Similarly, they had a higher prevalence of heart failure (P = .044), peripheral artery disease (P = .009), crackles at clinical status (P < .001), respiratory rate (P = .005), oxygen support needs (P < .001), C-reactive protein (P < .001), bilateral and peripheral infiltrates on chest radiographs (P = .001), and a lower prevalence of headache (P = .009). Furthermore, nonsurvivors were more often frail (P < .001), with worse functional status (P < .001), higher comorbidity burden (P < .001), and delirium at admission (P = .007). A multivariable Cox model showed that male sex (HR 4.00, 95% CI 2.08-7.71, P < .001), increased fraction of inspired oxygen (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, P < .001), and crackles (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.15-6.06, P = .019) were the best predictors of mortality, while better functional status was protective (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, male sex, crackles, a higher fraction of inspired oxygen, and functionality were independent risk factors of mortality. These routine parameters, and not differences in age, should be used to evaluate prognosis in older patients. Copyright © 2020 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

0	"Pooling RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in 1000 individuals of healthy and infection-suspected patients. Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing reagents are expected to become scarce worldwide. However, little is known regarding whether pooling of samples accurately detects SARS-CoV-2. To validate the feasibility of pooling samples, serial dilution analysis and spike-in experiments were conducted using synthetic DNA and nucleic acids extracted from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative patients. Furthermore, we studied 1000 individuals, 667 of whom were ""healthy"" individuals (195 healthcare workers and 472 hospitalized patients with disorders other than COVID-19 infection), and 333 infection-suspected patients with cough and fever. Serial dilution analysis showed a limit of detection of around 10-100 viral genome copies according to the protocol of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Spike-in experiments demonstrated that RT-qPCR detected positive signals in pooled samples with SARS-CoV-2-negative and -positive patients at 5-, 10-, 20-fold dilutions. By screening with this pooling strategy, by the end of April 2020 there were 12 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in 333 infection-suspected patients (3.6%) and zero in 667 ""healthy"" controls. We obtained these results with a total of 538 runs using the pooling strategy, compared with 1000 standard runs. In a prospective study, we successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 using 10- to 20-fold diluted samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from eighteen COVID-19 patients with wide ranges of viral load. Pooling sample is feasible for conserving test reagents and detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings. This strategy will help us to research the prevalence infected individuals and provide infected-status information to prevent the spread of the virus and nosocomial transmission."	false
0	PHLEGMASIA CERULEA DOLENS: AN ATYPICAL COVID-19 PRESENTATION. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Pulmonary Vascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The worldwide pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused numerous deaths worldwide, most directly due to resultant ARDS and respiratory failure. Physicians have seen an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in COVID-19 patients postulated due to a pro-inflammatory state caused by the virus, with a resultant increase in the frequency of micro thrombotic events [1]. We present the case of a patient with severe Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) in the setting of asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61 yo African American male with no significant past medical history presented with left leg swelling. Arterial and venous doppler ultrasound revealed an extensive thrombus throughout the left femoral and popliteal veins, with occlusion of arterial flow at the distal posterior tibial and peroneal arteries consistent with compartment syndrome and diagnosis of PCD. CT scan of the chest resulted in a finding of a large left main pulmonary artery pulmonary embolism with bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed positive by rapid nasopharyngeal PCR per our admission protocol despite the absence of fever, cough, shortness of breath or exposure. He was started emergently on anticoagulation therapy, intubated prophylactically, and taken to the operating room for emergent fasciotomy. His ICU course was complicated by worsening ventilator support, acute respiratory distress syndrome, worsening kidney injury, septic shock, and persistent bleeding from his wound requiring multiple transfusions. Due to nonviability and poor healing, the extremity was amputated, with noted systemic improvement in the ensuring days. He was extubated, downgraded out of the ICU, but this improvement was short-lived. His respiratory status drastically deteriorated, requiring re-intubation for hypoxia with recurrence of septic shock due to E.coli bacteremia as well as severe bleeding from the stump site. His status-declined with multiorgan failure despite aggressive resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood transfusion, pressor requirement, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The decision was made by the family to withdraw life support, and the patient expired. DISCUSSION: An increased presence of coagulopathy and VTEs has been seen in COVID-19 patients in both the ICU and medical floors [2].To date, the exact mechanism that leads to thromboembolic disease has yet to be determined but is thought to be due to the familiar combination of Virchow's triad: endothelial injury, blood stasis, and a hypercoagulable state [2-3]. CONCLUSION(S): In our case, the patient continued to deteriorate despite anticoagulation for his VTE. While not all patients with COVID-19 develop VTEs, it is important to be aware of the heightened risk for micro- and macro-thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

0	"Peripheral Neuropathy as a Complication of SARS-Cov-2. Previous reports have shown various neurological manifestations in about 36.4% of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. However, peripheral neuropathy was only reported once before. A 40-year-old healthy woman presented with two weeks of cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, intermittent fevers, fatigue, and myalgia but no weakness. She tested positive for the SARS-Cov-2. Physical exam showed no neurologic deficit. Two weeks later, respiratory symptoms were improving but she developed sudden leg pain, numbness, and weakness. She described it as a ""pain crisis"". Neurological exam showed bilateral symmetrical, non-ascending lower extremity weakness and normal, symmetric reflexes. She had normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, spinal fluid analysis, serum studies including creatinine kinase and C-reactive protein. She had elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low serum copper (72.9 (ref: 80.0-155.0 ug/dL)) and low vitamin B6 (14.6 (ref: 20.0-125.0 nmol/L)). A diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2-associated peripheral neuropathy was considered. We pursued empiric treatment with intravenous steroids (1000 mg methylprednisolone for three days), followed by a total of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) given over five days. Pain management was done with gabapentin and ketorolac. We replaced copper and vitamin B6. Six weeks later, she reported improvement and was closer to baseline, but she endorsed residual, exertional, mild bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Previous reports of treatment of SARS-Cov-2-associated neuropathy included corticosteroids and IVIG. Our patient saw the most symptomatic improvement with gabapentin. In our case, the preserved reflexes, lack of ascending pattern, sudden onset of symptoms, and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) argued against Guillain-Barre syndrome. Copper deficiency can result in myelopathy but not peripheral neuropathy, so is unlikely the sole explanation. Awareness and early treatment of peripheral neuropathy in SARS-Cov-2 can result in improved clinical outcomes for patients. Copyright © 2020, Bureau et al."	false

0	The effect of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in preventing sever infectious respiratory diseases other than TB: Implications for the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and its significant health and social impact urges the search for effective and readily avaiabel solutions to mitigate the damages. Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID - 19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of BCG vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal BCG vaccination.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The Association between Colostral density and immunoglubulin concentrations of Dairy Cattle. The colostrum contains diverse and numerous immunoglobulins. The neonatal calf obtains majority of passive immunity from colostrum, which especially has huge effects on calf health. Historically, the amount of immunoglobulins in colostrum has been predicted through the density of the colostrum, but this correlation has not yet been clearly determined. In this study, we determined the correlation between the density and the immunoglobulin concentration, the difference between Holstein and Jersey cattle, and the impact by parity number. Densities were measured with Cruise densimeter. The concentration of immunoglobulins was assayed by ELISA. The concentration of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antibody against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) tend to increase following the density of the colostrum. However, the level of antibody against rota-corona virus was not positively correlated with the density. Regarding species and parity effects, interestingly, Holstein cows had significantly higher values in total IgG and FMDV antibody than Jersey cows. Multiparous dairy cows produced colostrums with higher concentrations of total IgG, FMDV antibody than primiparous dairy cows.	false

0	Innate immunity in coronavirus infection. Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a polymorphic group of respiratory viruses causing acute inflammatory diseases in domestic and agricultural animals (chicken, pig, buffalo, cat, dog). Until recently, this infection in humans was mainly observed during the autumn-winter period and characterized by a mild, often asymptomatic, course. The situation changed dramatically in 2003, when SARS outbreak caused by pathogenic CoV (SARS-CoV) was recorded in China. A decade later, a new CoV outbreak occurred in the form of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), whereas in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases were recorded, which transformed within the first months of 2020 into the pandemic. In all three cases, CoV disease led to severe bronchopulmonary lesions, varying from dry, debilitating cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). At the same time, multiple changes in innate immunity were noted most often manifested as a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the lower respiratory tract, featured by damaged type II pneumocytes, apoptosis, hyalinization of alveolar membranes, focal or generalized pulmonary edema. Destructive processes in the respiratory tract were accompanied by migration of monocytes/macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils to the inflammatory focus. Such events were accompanied by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which magnitude could ascend up to a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV is characterized by symptoms of secondary immunosuppression, manifested by the late onset of interferon production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes - the key inflammatory factor. The reason for such reaction may be accounted for by CoV arsenal containing extensive set of structural and non-structural proteins exerting pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Delayed IFN production allowed CoV to replicate actively and freely, and when type I IFN synthesis was eventually triggered, its activity was detrimental and accompanied by an aggravated infection course. Thus, SARS can surely be referred to immune-dependent infections with a marked immunopathological component. The purpose of this review was to describe some mechanisms underlying formation of innate immune response to infection caused by pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).Copyright © 2020 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

0	E. COLI PNEUMONIA WITH PNEUMATOCELE, EMPYEMA NECESSITANS, AND BRONCHOPLEURAL FISTULA IN A PATIENT WITH SEVERE COVID-19. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor used in rheumatologic disease and cytokine release syndrome, is one of many investigational drugs used for coronavirus disease-19 pneumonia (COVID). While the safety profile has been well studied, there is little known about its effect on opportunistic infections (OI) risk in patients with COVID. We present a 43-year-old man with COVID who received tocilizumab and subsequently developed cavitating lung lesions suspicious for invasive aspergillosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man with diabetes mellitus was admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF). Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction was positive for COVID. He was placed on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and on day 10 he was intubated for worsening HRF. He was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, methylprednisolone, convalescent plasma, and tocilizumab. Antibiotics later included ertapenem due to E. coli with extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) found in sputum culture. He was extubated on day 15 and oxygen requirements were weaned to HFNC. However, bronchial aspirate cultures from day 14 grew mold and subsequent serologies were positive for Aspergillus. Chest computerized tomography (CT) was notable for the development of multiple new cavitary lesions concerning for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient was initially treated with voriconazole and later with amphotericin B due to liver enzyme elevation. The patient's oxygen requirements initially decreased, however on day 30 the patient suffered an aspiration event and was reintubated. Subsequent CT was concerning for worsening of cavitary lung disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected, which tested positive for Aspergillus galactomannan. On hospital day 31, the patient suffered a left-sided tension pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy. At the time of submission the patient remains critically ill. DISCUSSION: Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a known complication of severe influenza.1,2 Similarly, COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) may become an emerging problem given the overwhelming inflammation and use of experimental immunosuppressive therapies in COVID.1,2 While tocilizumab has not been shown to increase risk of Aspergillus infection in rheumatologic disease, it has not been studied in COVID and the risk of OI in an already-susceptible group may outweigh the benefits of using this drug in patients with COVID.3 If CAPA is similar to IAPA, BAL galactomannan is the gold standard for diagnosis.2 CONCLUSION(S): As the medical community searches for COVID treatments, these patients' potentially inherent vulnerability to OI may be under-appreciated. When using immunosuppressive agents to curtail the inflammatory cascade, the risk of OI must be considered and agents like tocilizumab must be further studied in this context.

0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Modeling Study of Factors Driving Variation in Case Fatality Rate by Country. Background: The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has led to a global pandemic in which case fatality rate (CFR) has varied from country to country. This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion:  Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.	false
0	Coronavirus as a new challenge for infection control in dentistry: A literature review. Modes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus are still unclear. The virus could spread through direct routes, including aerosols and saliva, and indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces. Dental practitioners produce airborne infectious particles especially when using rotary instruments during treatment. Oral fluids, blood, and oral mucosa are also sources of infection, so dentists are exposed to coronavirus more than other medical staff. Indeed, designing appropriate protocols and prevention strategies are highly important. In this review paper, we will explain and review the transmission pathways of the coronavirus, clinical signs of infected patients, dental office infection control, and dental treatment considerations.Copyright © 2020, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

0	Convalescent (Immune) plasma therapy with all aspects: Yesterday, today and COVID-19. At the end of 2019, the pandemic, which originated in China, has become a major concern all over the world. A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been defined as the reason for a cluster of unknown pneumonia. Thus far, no precise therapy or vaccine has been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild cases can be treated by supportive care although symptomatic treatment is not enough for critically ill patients. However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, convalescent (immune) plasma (CIP) and certain specific antiviral drugs for this disease are still being investigated for improving the survival rate of cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection whose condition continued to deteriorate. The use of passive immunization, for the prophylaxis and therapy of human contagious diseases, has been gone back to the 20th century. Human whole blood is also a source of antibodies. CIP consists of collecting blood plasma from someone who has recovered from a specific infection. Recent literature data show that human CIP may be an alternative option for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and will be accessible when adequate numbers of individuals have improved. However, such donors should have a high titer of neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma. CIP can be administered to improve the survival rate for COVID-19, together with other drugs and preventive measures, when specific management is not obtainable. On the other hand, randomized clinical trials are still necessary to assess the safety and efficiency of CIP in the therapy of COVID-19. In this article, we want to address the special role of CIP therapy in various infectious diseases from yesterday to today, including COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine.	false
0	Congenital Inner Ear Abnormalities and COVID-19-Related Ear Infections. Congenital deformities of the labyrinth of the inner ear may be associated with an increased risk of infection and varying degrees of otologic and vestibular dysfunction. Lateral semicircular canal abnormalities specifically can be associated with either normal hearing or hearing loss (conductive or sensorineural). In our patient, the acute symptoms of vertigo and tinnitus coincided with the diagnosis of COVID-19. It is unlikely that the symptomatology was related to the acute infection, even in the face of the underlying congenital abnormality. It has been shown that there is no correlation between the severity of the radiological abnormality and vestibular symptomatology in patients with isolated abnormalities of the semicircular canals. The abnormality can be asymptomatic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	New coronavirus (2019-nCoV/COVID-19) and vitamin C. For the first time in December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, China. Then, in addition to China and on the basis of increasing incidence and mor-tality rates in other international countries, the global emergency health status was declared by the World Health Organization Emergency Committee, and a new coronavirus was reported.Due to the very high contagion rate of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19), it has affected and continues to affect quite a lot of people from all age groups in the world. General clinical signs of COVID-19 are high fever, cough, nasal congestion, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, upper and lower respiratory tract infection and diarrhea. The most important and fatal clinical sign of the virus has been described as pneumonia. Un-fortunately, no vaccine or special antiviral drug has been developed against COVID-19 yet. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to ex-amine whether intravenous vitamin C administration is a promising method for the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with the most re-cent evidence. Using vitamin C to prevent or treat diseases is often classified in complementary and alternative medicine. For this rea-son, it should never prevent the actual treatment. Studies have found that high doses of vitamin C reduce lung damage in COVID-19 and other flu infections. Therefore, intravenous vitamin C administration may be useful in addition to COVID-19 treatment.There is a need for high-level clinical studies on the effect of Vitamin C administration on COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by Turkiye Klinikleri.	false

Aim Despite the regular heart damage in patients with coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2, a possibility of developing lymphocytic myocarditis as a part of COVID-19 remains unsubstantiated. The aim of this study was to demonstrate a possibility of lymphocytic myocarditis and to study its morphological features in patients with the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) with a severe course.Material and methods Postmortem data were studied for 5 elderly patients (74.8+/-4.4 years; 3 men and 2 women) with the novel coronavirus infection and bilateral, severe polysegmental pneumonia (stage 3-4 by computed tomography). COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the typical clinical presentation and positive polymerase chain reaction test in nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were treated in different hospitals repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A standard histological study was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and van Gieson staining. Serial paraffin slices were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD3, SD68, CD20, perforin, and toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9. Results In none of the cases, myocarditis was suspected clinically, added to the diagnosis or indicated as a possible cause of death. IHD and acute myocardial infarction were mentioned as error diagnoses not confirmed by the postmortem examination. The morphological examination of the heart identified signs of lymphocytic myocarditis consistent with Dallas criteria for this diagnosis. Myocardial infiltrate was characterized in detail, and a combined inflammatory damage of endocardium and pericardium was described. The immunohistochemical study with cell infiltrate typing confirmed the presence of CD3-positive T lymphocytes and the increased expression of TLR-4. A picture of coronaritis, including that with microvascular thrombosis, was found in all cases. Conclusion A possibility for development of lymphocytic viral myocarditis in COVID-19 was confirmed morphologically and immunohistochemically. Specific features of myocarditis in COVID-19 include the presence of coronaritis and a possible combination of myocarditis with lymphocytic endo- and pericarditis.	false
0	Measurement of filtration efficiencies of healthcare and consumer materials using modified respirator fit tester setup. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there is unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators and surgical masks. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted via respiratory droplets from asymptomatic individuals has necessitated increased usage of both N95 respirators in the healthcare setting and masks (both surgical and homemade) in public spaces. These precautions rely on two fundamental principles of transmission prevention: particle filtration and droplet containment. The former is the focus of NIOSH N95 testing guidelines, and the latter is an FDA guideline for respirators and surgical masks. While studies have investigated droplet containment to provide guidance for homemade mask production, limited work has been done to characterize the filtration efficiency (FE) of materials used in home mask making. In this work, we demonstrate the low-cost (<$300) conversion of standard equipment used to fit-test respirators in hospital and industrial settings into a setup that measures quantitative FEs of materials based on NIOSH N95 guidelines, and subsequently measure FEs of materials found in healthcare and consumer spaces. These materials demonstrate significant variability in filtration characteristics, even for visually similar materials. We demonstrate a FE of 96.49% and pressure drop of 25.4 mmH20 for a double-layer of sterilization wrap used in surgical suites and a FE of 90.37% for a combination of consumer-grade materials. The excellent filtration characteristics of the former demonstrate potential utility for emergent situations when N95 respirators are not available, while those of the latter demonstrate that a high FE can be achieved using publicly available materials.Copyright © 2020 Long et al.

0	Hock-a-loogie saliva as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by a PCR-based assay: A diagnostic validity study. To clarify the effect of different respiratory sample types on SARS-CoV-2 detection, we collected throat swabs, nasal swabs and hock-a-loogie saliva or sputum, and compared their detection rates and viral loads. The detection rates of sputum (95.65%, 22/23) and hock-a-loogie saliva (88.09%, 37/42) were significantly higher than those in throat swabs (41.54%, 27/65) and nasal swabs (72.31%, 47/65) (P < 0.001). The Ct Values of sputum, hock-a-loogie saliva and nasal swabs were significantly higher than that in throat swabs, whereas no significant difference was observed between sputum and saliva samples. Hock-a-loogie saliva are reliable sample types that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, and worthy of clinical promotion.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Hepatitis C virus vaccine design: Focus on the humoral immune response. Despite the recent development of safe and highly effective direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a significant health problem. In 2016, the World Health Organization set out to reduce the rate of new HCV infections by 90% by 2030. Still, global control of the virus does not seem to be achievable in the absence of an effective vaccine. Current approaches to the development of a vaccine against HCV include the production of recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides, DNA vaccines, virus-like particles, and viral vectors expressing various antigens. In this review, we focus on the development of vaccines targeting the humoral immune response against HCV based on the cumulative evidence supporting the important role of neutralizing antibodies in protection against HCV infection. The main targets of HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies are the glycoproteins E1 and E2. Recent advances in the knowledge of HCV glycoprotein structure and their epitopes, as well as the possibility of getting detailed information on the human antibody repertoire generated by the infection, will allow rational structure-based antigen design to target specific germline antibodies. Although obtaining a vaccine capable of inducing sterilizing immunity will be a difficult task, a vaccine that prevents chronic hepatitis C infections, a more realistic goal in the short term, would have a considerable health impact.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

0	Gender Disaggregation in COVID-19 and Increased Male Susceptibility. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing public health crisis. Despite initial focus on the elderly population with comorbidities, it seems that large studies from the worst affected countries follow a sex-disaggregation pattern. Analysis of available data showed marked variations in reported cases between males and females among different countries with higher mortality in males. At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males. Keywords: COVID-19; gender; males; sex disaggregation; susceptibility.	false
0	"COVID 19 vertical transmission: A growing concern. Context: COVID 19 vertical transmission is a great concern in different aspects of mother, child, healthcare staff and community safety and protection. There is lack of definitive evidence confirming or declining mother to child COVID 19 transmission. This article is an update on this challenging issue. Evidence Acquisition: This article is a comprehensive search in scientific major database from 1 January 2020 up to 25 April 2020 with the key words of ""COVID 19"" and ""vertical transmission"" or ""neonatal"". Two researchers reviewed all selected articles to extract data about neonatal COVID 19 and vertical transmission. Those reports that provided the results of PCR on fetus or neonate blood, amniotic fluid or pharyngeal secretion samples or elevated COVID 19 specific IgM were included. Those reports based on clinical COVID 19 characteristics or radiological findings were not included in data extraction. Thirty six articles have been reviewed and evidence supporting or against COVID 19 Vertical transmission have been extracted and discussed. Result(s): Most previous studies on vertical COVID 19 transmission have been tested placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and newborn blood or pharyngeal swab sample using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that may show false negative results due to suboptimal sampling or inefficient viral load. Increased COVID 19 specific IgG/IgM antibodies have been reported in newborns from COVID 19 mothers; however, data is limited and longitudinal follow up is needed. Evidence supporting COVID 19 vertical transmission: Recent reports indicated that pharyngeal PCR test turned positive in first few hours of life in several neonates. Also increased level of COVID 19 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in newborns to COVID 19 positive mothers were observed. Rate of perinatal complications were higher among newborns of COVID 19 mothers. Evidence against COVID 19 vertical transmis-sion: All tissue or blood specimens and pharyngeal swab qRT-PCR tests among neonates born from COVID 19 mothers were negative. Rate of cross reactivity and false positive results are high in serologic studies. Conclusion(s): COVID 19 vertical transmission is a growing health care concern that needs further investigation; however, it is sug-gested to be equipped with PPE on contacts with both COVID 19 pregnant woman and her newborn baby and apply early separation, isolation, testing and close follow up for both mother and child.Copyright © 2020, Author(s)."	false
0	COVID-19 Risk Management and Screening in the Penitentiary Facilities of the Salerno Province in Southern Italy. (1) Background: The emergency linked to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy has led to inevitable consequences on the penitentiary system. The risks of this emergency in prisons is mainly related to the problem of persistent overcrowding that makes social distancing difficult and the isolation of any contagion hard to arrange. The Department of Protection for Adults and Minors of the ASL Salerno Criminal Area has taken steps in order to perform screening operations and minimize the risks for prisoners and operators. (2) Methods: We conducted a two-phase observational study. In the first phase, we offered and then executed serum COVID-19 screening to all the convicted inmates. For those who had a doubtful or positive result, a swab was executed in the shortest time possible. In the second phase, a pharyngeal swab was offered and executed to all the police officers, the penitentiary administrative staff and the medical personnel working in the prison. (3) Results: In the first phase, we executed 485 COVID-19 blood tests on prisoners, 3 (0.61%) of which were positive. The three positive inmates underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing, which ultimately were negative. After that, we executed 276 nasopharyngeal swabs on the prison personnel, penitentiary administrative staff and medical personnel-all were negative. (4) Conclusion: All tests (blood tests and swabs) that were carried out on the prisoners and on the staff were negative for COVID-19. We believe that all prisons in Italy and in the world should take action to ensure preventive and control measures in order to safeguard the health of the prison population and of all the people who work there.	false
0	COVID-19 infections and Africa: Why do the African countries show the least number of cases?. Introduction: The new COVID-19 spread quickly all over the countries. The clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease may be asymptomatic or presented as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ failure. Supportive and symptomatic treatment is the first line of therapy. Until now, no approved treatment for COVID-19 but there is some trials with use of antiviral drugs, intravenous immunoglobulin, interferons, ivermectin and chloroquine. Main Hypothesis: Almost all the countries have been affected by this viral infection with rapidly increasing rates. Although the Africa region has showed an increase in the number of confirmed cases recently, there are still fewer cases than in other parts of the world. This viewpoint review highlights some factors that are hypothesized to be related to the decreased rate of COVID-19 cases in Africa than other regions. Conclusion(s): The decreased rate of COVID-19 cases in Africa than other regions may related to many factors; genetic poly-morphisms of ACE in African people, the prevalence of malaria infection and the widespread use of malaria's treatment.Copyright © 2020 Japan Health Sciences University & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.	false
0	Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states. Although most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting. Reported cases and deaths have been concentrated in younger cohorts than would be expected from observations in higher-income countries, even after accounting for demographic differences across settings. Among 575,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases, infection probabilities ranged from 4.7 to 10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types, respectively. Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk. Case fatality ratios spanned 0.05% at ages of 5 to 17 years to 16.6% at ages of 85 years or more. Primary data from low-resource countries are urgently needed to guide control measures.

0	"Effects of air pollution on the potential transmission and mortality of COVID-19: A preliminary case-study in Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain). The number of studies published on COVID-19 in recent months is certainly impressive. However, there are still important gaps to know a great number of characteristics of this disease. Among these, some potential ways of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and the different reasons for the severity of the disease in different people. Various studies have suggested that certain air pollutants could be increasing the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as the risks of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. In the present preliminary case-study conducted in Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain), we studied the potential association of COVID-19 with PM10, NO2 and O3, as well as the differences in the incidence and lethality of this disease. This Province is divided into two ""health regions"": Camp de Tarragona, with an important industrial complex, and Terres de l'Ebre, with a great agricultural component. In spite of the notable limitations of the current study, our preliminary findings indicate that the industrialized/urban areas of Tarragona Province show a higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than the agricultural/rural zones. These - and previous - results would highlight the importance of conducting specific investigations focused on directly assessing whether air pollutants such as particulate matter can act as carriers of the SARS-CoV-2. If confirmed, the recommendation on keeping the ""social distance"" (1.5-2 m) might need to be adapted to this situation.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc."	false

0	Roles and challenges of coordinated public health laboratory response against COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) continues to rise, many countries have been seeking for medical assistance such as donation or procurement of laboratory test kits and strips. These consumables are largely intended for use in the laboratory investigations of COVID-19 cases, suspected contacts, asymptomatic persons and in discharging cured persons. Thus, this article was instigated to update and remind healthcare providers and policymakers (especially those in developing countries) on the principles of sample collections, storage, transportation, laboratory protocols and networks needed for appropriate public health response against COVID-19 pandemic in Africa and other developing countries. In addition, this article presents challenges that hinder adequate COVID-19 laboratory response and discuss some possible solutions that could ameliorate these constrains.Copyright © 2020 Abdullahi et al.

0	COVID-19 in long-term care facilities in Frankfurt am Main, Germany: incidence, case reports, and lessons learned. As of August 30, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported 24,822,800 COVID-19 infections world wide. Severe disease and deaths occur especially in older people with chronic illnesses. Residents of nursing homes are considered to be the most vulnerable group. In this paper, the experiences with COVID-19 in nursing homes in Frankfurt will be presented and discussed. Materials and methods: Based on the data of the statutory reporting obligation, the reported COVID-19 cases are presented and incidences are calculated in different age groups and among residents of nursing homes. Outbreaks in various homes are described in detail based on the documentation from the public health department. Results: By August 28, 2020, 2,665 COVID-19 infections were reported in Frankfurt am Main (incidence 351/100,000 inhabitants), including 116 (4.3%) residents of nursing homes (2,416/100,000 residents). Almost half (39%) of all deaths in Frankfurt (n=69; incidence 9.1/100,000) were among nursing home residents (n=27; incidence 558/100,000 nursing home residents), with 22 of them in just one long-term care facility (LTCF). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in nursing homes did not increase in the first half of 2020. In one home, 75% of residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 25% died; in two other homes, 6.7% and 14.1% of the residents became infected, and the mortality rate was 0.5% and 1%, resp. In the other 42 homes in the city (3,906 beds), the infection rate remained below 1% and the death rate was 0.1%. Discussion: In many countries, 30-70% of all deaths occur among nursing home residents, including Frankfurt (39%). An increase in overall mortality compared to previous years was not observed in Frankfurt as a whole or in the nursing homes in the city specifically. Due to the measures taken (monitoring of residents and staff, nursing care in protective clothing, prohibition or restriction of visits, physical distancing, isolation of infected people and quarantining of contact persons), only individual cases of COVID-19 illnesses occurred in nursing home residents in most homes and the outbreaks in the three homes could be stopped. We do not recommend regular nontargeted testing in nursing homes, but rather vigilance and the implementation of good hygiene as well as immediate targeted testing if COVID-19 is suspected in residents or staff. In order to mitigate the considerable negative effects of these measures on the residents, a good balance should be sought between infection prevention and the goal of ensuring self-determination and the residents' quality of life.

0	Cardiac damage in patients with the severe type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Studies showed COVID-19 affected not only the lung but also other organs. In this study, we aimed to explore the cardiac damage in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We collected data of 100 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to April 10, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, and treatment. In-hospital mortality were observed. Cardiac damage was defined as plasma hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) over 34.2 pg/ml and/or N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) above 450 pg/ml at the age < 50, above 900 pg/ml at the age < 75, or above 1800 pg/ml at the age >= 75., RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old. 69 (69.0%) had comorbidities, mainly presenting hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fever (69 [69.0%]), cough (63 [63.0%]), chest distress (13 [13.0%]), and fatigue (12 [12.0%]) were the common initial symptoms. Cardiac damage occurred in 25 patients. In the subgroups, hsTnI was significantly higher in elder patients (>= 60 years) than in the young (median [IQR], 5.2 [2.2-12.8] vs. 1.9 [1.9-6.2], p = 0.018) and was higher in men than in women (4.2 [1.9-12.8] vs. 2.9 [1.9-7.4], p = 0.018). The prevalence of increased NTproBNP was significantly higher in men than in women (32.1% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.006), but was similar between the elder and young patients (20.0% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.554). After multivariable analysis, male and hypertension were the risk factors of cardiac damage. The mortality was 4.0%., CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac damage exists in patients with the severe type of COVID-19, especially in male patients with hypertension. Clinicians should pay more attention to cardiac damage.	false

0	Lung computed tomography patterns of a cluster of asymptomatic young males with COVID-19 admitted to a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Background and objective: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Malaysia in March 2020. We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Method(s): This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists. Result(s): In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [+/-SD], 21.64+/-2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thorax for early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older age groups, and not in younger patients.Copyright © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

0	Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology of maxillofacial trauma activity: a French multicentre comparative study. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had a major impact on medical and surgical activities. A decline in facial trauma incidence was noticed during the lockdown period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decline in maxillofacial trauma in France during this particular period. A retrospective multicentre comparative study was initiated in 13 major French public hospital centres. The incidence of facial trauma requiring surgery during the first month of lockdown was compared to that during equivalent periods in 2018 and 2019. Differences in the types of trauma were also analysed. Thirteen maxillofacial departments participated in the study. A significant decline in maxillofacial trauma volumes was observed when compared to equivalent periods in 2018 and 2019 (106 patients compared to 318 and 296 patients, respectively), with an average reduction of 65.5% (P=0.00087). The proportion of trauma due to sports and leisure was reduced when compared to reports in the literature. As a consequence, in the context of a pandemic, the material and human resources related to this activity could be reallocated to the management of other pathologies that cannot be postponed.

0	[Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on anxiety among the elderly in community]. Objective: To compare the prevalence of anxiety among old people before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, and to provide scientific evidence for psychological intervention of the elderly during public health emergencies. Methods: In 2019, the National Psychological Care Project for the Elderly was launched, covering 818 communities across the country, and 188 407 subjects received psychological assessment. In April and May 2020, a convenient sample of 6 467 aged 65 and above subjects were followed up on the anxiety status and its influencing factors during the epidemic period by using structurized questionnaire. Data collection and management were carried out using the national elderly psychological care project data collection platform. McNemar test was used to compare the difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly before (October 2019 to January 23, 2020) and during the epidemic (April-May 2020). The difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly with different characteristics was compared by chi square test. The influencing factors of anxiety before and during the epidemic situation were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the elderly population was 4.95% (95%CI: 4.42%-5.48%) before the outbreak of COVID-19, and 10.10% (95%CI: 9.36%-10.83%) during the epidemic which was twice as high as before the outbreak. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors of anxiety symptoms before the outbreak were with one underlying disease (OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.05-2.37), with two or more underlying diseases (OR=3.10, 95%CI: 2.13-4.51), and the protective factors were with hobbies, good relationship between children, good relationship with spouse, positive aging attitude and good psychological resilience (all P<0.05). The risk factors of developing anxiety symptoms during the epidemic were living in rural areas (OR=1.77, 95%CI: 1.42-2.20), participating in social activities regularly (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.48), having a good relationship with friends (OR=1.42, 95%CI: 1.11-1.82) and were quarantined or people around were quarantined for medical observation (OR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.90-4.13). Conclusion:  The COVID-19 epidemic leads to a double increase in anxiety among the elderly. We should pay more attention to the psychological state of the elderly in rural area and who is being quarantined or people around being quarantined for medical observation.	false
0	Declines in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission, Hospitalizations, and Mortality After Implementation of Mitigation Measures- Delaware, March-June 2020. Mitigation measures, including stay-at-home orders and public mask wearing, together with routine public health interventions such as case investigation with contact tracing and immediate self-quarantine after exposure, are recommended to prevent and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3). On March 11, the first COVID-19 case in Delaware was reported to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH). The state responded to ongoing community transmission with investigation of all identified cases (commencing March 11), issuance of statewide stay-at-home orders (March 24-June 1), a statewide public mask mandate (from April 28), and contact tracing (starting May 12). The relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March-June 2020. Incidence declined by 82%, hospitalization by 88%, and mortality by 100% from late April to June 2020, as the mask mandate and contact tracing were added to case investigations and the stay-at-home order. Among 9,762 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during March 11-June 25, 2020, two thirds (6,527; 67%) of patients were interviewed, and 5,823 (60%) reported completing isolation. Among 2,834 contacts reported, 882 (31%) were interviewed and among these contacts, 721 (82%) reported completing quarantine. Implementation of mitigation measures, including mandated mask use coupled with public health interventions, was followed by reductions in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality. The combination of state-mandated community mitigation efforts and routine public health interventions can reduce the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 25 May 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused 347,192 deaths around the world. The current evidence showed that severely ill patients tend to have a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill. The high level of cytokines also indicates a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Besides, excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly involving macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, has been found in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 by postmortem examination. Recently, increasing studies indicate that the ""cytokine storm"" may contribute to the mortality of COVID-19. Here, we summarize the clinical and pathologic features of the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Our review shows that SARS-Cov-2 selectively induces a high level of IL-6 and results in the exhaustion of lymphocytes. The current evidence indicates that tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is relatively effective and safe. Besides, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antimalarial agents could be potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.© Copyright © 2020 Tang, Liu, Zhang, Xu, Ji and Wen."	false
0	COVID-19 Clinical Characteristics, and Sex-Specific Risk of Mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It was first detected in the Wuhan city of China and has spread globally resulting in a substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified different aspects of this disease. There have been no published systematic reviews that combine clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, and mortality findings. Also, the effect of gender on the outcomes of COVID-19 has not been well-defined. Method(s): We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. P < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Result(s): Out of 1,223 studies, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 5,057 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5-87.6) and cough (65.2%, CI 58.6-71.2) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5%, CI 12.7-24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9%, CI 6.0-23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0%, CI 54.3-84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0-62.4) were the most common. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1-78.0) was the most common CT scan presentation. The pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2-9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): COVID-19 has caused a significant number of hospitalization and mortality worldwide. Mortality associated with COVID-19 was higher in our study compared to the previous reports from China. The mortality was significantly higher among the hospitalized male group. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of different variables resulting in sex disparity in COVID-19 mortality.© Copyright © 2020 Nasiri, Haddadi, Tahvildari, Farsi, Arbabi, Hasanzadeh, Jamshidi, Murthi and Mirsaeidi.	false
0	COVID-19 and late-onset hypertension with hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism. We have observed hypernatraemia and hypokalaemia with normal serum urea and creatinine associated with new-onset hypertension among COVID-19 patients. We assessed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) of 2 patients during the pandemic and found elevated urinary potassium (without causal medications) and hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism in both.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Covid 19 and its cardiovascular effects. COVID-19 pandemic is mainly related with the pulmonary problems initially but now as the pandemic is growing it is observed that almost all organ systems of the body are affected. Up to 20-30% patients who are admitted in Covid hospitals are showing cardiovascular involvement. Severity of cardiovascular disease in a COVID-19 patient depends whether a patient is having pre-existing cardiac disease or not. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease have more severe infection and associated mortality. Severe COVID-19 infection shows close association with myocardial damage and various arrythmias. The cardiovascular involvement occurs by either engagement directly with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or indirectly by the effect of inflammatory mediators which are generated as a result of viral-host response to infection. The COVID-19 disease is said to produce a wide spectrum of affliction ranging between even asymptomatic patient to Cardiovascular syndrome. Even after recovering from COVID-19 patients can reappear in the hospital with cardiomyopathies and arrythmias.	false
0	Clinical manifestations and factors associated with mortality from COVID-19 in older adults: Retrospective population-based study with 9807 older Brazilian COVID-19 patients. Aim: Older adults are the main risk group for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations and factors associated with mortality from COVID-19 among older adults in Brazil. Method(s): A cross-sectional observational study was carried out with data from 9807 cases of COVID-19 among older adults in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. We determined the case fatality rate between age groups and clinical factors associated with mortality. Result(s): A total of 52.5% (n = 5145) were women, and with an average age of 70.21 +/- 8.37 years. The fatality rate was 11.9%, with a higher rate in men (14.4%) compared with women (9.8%). The fatality rate increased with age. The most common manifestations were fever (n = 4926; 50.2%), cough (n = 5737; 58.5%), headache (n = 1980; 20.2%) and fatigue (n = 2022; 20.6%). The most prevalent comorbidities were diabetes (n = 1528; 5.6%), cardiovascular disease (n = 1528; 15.6%) and systemic arterial hypertension (n = 597; 6.1%). The factors associated with mortality were male sex (OR 1.54), age >=75 years (OR 2.40), dyspnea (OR 2.92), diabetes (OR 2.33), hypertension (OR 1.53) and chronic kidney disease (OR 2.02). Conclusion(s): The profile and the risk factors evidenced show the need to adopt mechanisms to protect the elderly population.Copyright © 2020 Japan Geriatrics Society	false
0	Clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has quickly spread throughout the world. In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Method(s): PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. Case reports and case series of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers screened 366 studies and 14 studies were included. Four reviewers independently extracted the features from the studies. We used a random-effects model to analyse the incidence (P) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Result(s): The meta-analysis included 236 pregnant women with COVID-19. The results were as follows: positive CT findings (71%; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93), caesarean section (65%; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), fever (51%; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67), lymphopenia (49%; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), coexisting disorders (33%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44), cough (31%; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), fetal distress (29%; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), preterm labor (23%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.32), and severe case or death (12%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.20). The subgroup analysis showed that compared with non-pregnant patients, pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly lower incidences of fever (pregnant women, 51%; non-pregnant patients, 91%; P < 0.00001) and cough (pregnant women, 31%; non-pregnant patients, 67%; P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The incidences of fever, cough and positive CT findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are less than those in the normal population with COVID-19, but the rate of preterm labor is higher among pregnant with COVID-19 than among normal pregnant women. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through vertical transmission.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for mortality in patients with cancer and COVID-19 in Hubei, China: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study. Background: Patients with cancer are a high-risk population in the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. Method(s): We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020. All patients were either discharged from hospitals or had died by April 20, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of chi2 test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Finding(s): Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56-70; range 14-96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 68 days (IQR 59-78). The most common solid tumour types were breast (40 [20%] patients), colorectal (28 [14%]), and lung cancer (24 [12%]). 54 (30%) of 182 patients received antitumour therapies within 4 weeks before symptom onset. 30 (15%) of 205 patients were transferred to an intensive care unit and 40 (20%) died during hospital admission. Patients with haematological malignancies had poorer prognoses than did those with solid tumours: nine (41%) of 22 patients with haematological malignancies died versus 31 (17%) of 183 patients with solid tumours (hazard ratio for death 3.28 [95% CI 1.56-6.91]; log rank p=0.0009). Multivariable regression analysis showed that receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] 3.51 [95% CI 1.16-10.59]; p=0.026) and male sex (OR 3.86 [95% CI 1.57-9.50]; p=0.0033) were risk factors for death during admission to hospital. Interpretation(s): Patients with cancer and COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had a high case-fatality rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors, including receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset and male sex, might help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of fatal outcomes.

0	MATURE HUMAN OOCYTES AND PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SARS-COV-2 INFECTION BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 PROTEINS. Objective: SARS-CoV-2 entry in host cells requires the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the extracellular receptor, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 to cleave the viral spike protein for incorporation into the host cell. Basigin (BSG/CD147) may also act as an ACE2 independent receptor mechanism. The cysteine protease cathepsin-L (CTSL) may also cleave the viral spike proteins and facilitate cell entry. The objective of this study was to characterize the mRNA and protein expression of these cellular entry receptors and proteases in female reproductive cells to determine their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design(s): Prospective Research Study. Material(s) and Method(s): Material(s) and Method(s): Oocytes (GV, MII), follicular cells (cumulus, CC; granulosa, GC) and embryos (1 cell, 1C; blastocyst, BL) were collected from a minimum of three different patients per sample type, with consent. Samples were analyzed for mRNA expression of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL genes relative to GAPDH using RT-qPCR. Primers were validated using human mixed tissue cDNA. Protein quantification was performed by immunoblotting using the Jess system (ProteinSimple) optimized to detect over 10 proteins/5-10 oocytes or embryos. Antibodies for ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL proteins were validated and then used to determine protein abundance relative to total protein. Data were obtained from three independent biological replicates and analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Result(s): Results from q-PCR analysis revealed high (p<0.05) abundance of ACE2 transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was present in all the samples, but was relatively higher (p<0.17) in M2 oocytes, 1C, BL, and CC compared to GV oocytes and GC. TMPRSS2 protein was abundant in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL, and was present but at low levels in GV oocytes and follicular cells. Protein abundance of CD147 was five-fold higher (p<0.05) in GV and ~1.5 fold higher in GC compared to all other samples analyzed. No CTSL protein was observed with the expected molecular weight (38 kD), although a 55 kD band (a possible isoform) was detected in GV oocytes and CC. Conclusion(s): Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases. Co-expression of the protein for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts suggests that these reproductive cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, using a combined approach of mRNA and protein analysis from the same samples suggests that mature human oocytes and preimplantation embryos have the cellular machinery required for SARS-Cov2 entry, although we do not know if this occurs in vivo. The potential for viral infection in oocytes and embryos has important ramifications for ART. Care must be taken to avoid introduction of the virus to the embryo while in the ART laboratory, as well as potentially introducing the virus from an infected embryo to laboratory workspaces.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 421 Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Treated in a Mobile Cabin Hospital. Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia, now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in Wuhan, China. To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. Research Question: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Study Design and Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. Result(s): Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0degreeC) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days). Interpretation(s): Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and offer an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Copyright © 2020 American College of Chest Physicians	false
0	Clinical characteristics and antibiotics treatment in suspected bacterial infection patients with COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought challenges to health and social care systems. However, the empirical use of antibiotics is still confusing. Presently, a total of 1123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was included in this retrospective cohort study. The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group. Moreover, penicillin and meropenem treatments were associated with increased mortality of the patients with no evidence of bacterial infection. In conclusion, patients with suspected bacterial infection were more likely to have negative clinical outcomes than those without bacterial infection. Empirical use of antibiotics may not have the expected benefits. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein Alleviates Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain 3-Induced Fulminant Hepatitis by Inhibiting Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2 Expression. Background: Fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a serious threat to human life, accompanied by massive and rapid necroinflammation. Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Method(s): A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Result(s): In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN-gamma-treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN-gamma-primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion(s):CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages. Such effects may be mediated by the transcription factor HBP1.	false
0	Characteristics Associated With Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes in an Academic Health Care System. Importance: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. Objective(s): To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. Exposure: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription-PCR tests performed in external labs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). Result(s): Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P=.009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P=.02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P=.02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P<.001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P=.04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P<.001; P for interaction=.02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P=.005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P=.53; P for interaction=.04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P=.001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P=.88; P for interaction=.02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P<.001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P=.59; P for interaction=.046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in high-population density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. Associations of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race.	false

0	Assessing the distribution of elderly requiring care: A case study on the residents in barcelona and the impact of COVID-19. In this work, we establish a methodological framework to analyze the care demand for elderly citizens in any area with a large proportion of elderly population, and to find connections to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Thanks to this analysis, it is possible to detect deficiencies in the public elderly care system, identify the most disadvantaged areas in this sense, and reveal convenient information to improve the system. The methods used in each step of the framework belong to data analytics: choropleth maps, clustering analysis, principal component analysis, or linear regression. We applied this methodology to Barcelona to analyze the distribution of the demand for elderly care services. Thus, we obtained a deeper understanding of how the demand for elderly care is dispersed throughout the city. Considering the characteristics that were likely to impact the demand for homecare in the neighborhoods, we clearly identified five groups of neighborhoods with different profiles and needs. Additionally, we found that the number of cases in each neighborhood was more correlated to the number of elderly people in the neighborhood than it was to the number of beds in assisted living or day care facilities in the neighborhood, despite the negative impact of COVID-19 cases on the reputation of this kind of center.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Analysis of false negative results in throat swab nucleic acid test of severe acute resporatory syndrome coronavirus 2. Objective To investigate the false negative rate of throat swab nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to analyze the causes, so as to provide references for the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on the throat swab nucleic acid test results of 1 452 COVID-19 patients admitted to Guanggu Branch of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital of Hubei Province from Feb. 19 to Mar. 20, 2020. The negative results before positive results at discharge were judged as false negative results, and the false negative rate was calculated. The discharged patients were followed up to screen for the patients who were positive for nucleic acid test again, and the relationship between the times of consecutive negative nucleic acid tests before discharge and the positive again results was analyzed. Results Among the 1 452 COVID-19 patients, 592 (40.77%) were males and 860 (59.23%) were females. A total of 212 cases (14.60%) had false negative results. Twenty-eight cases (1.93%) were discovered nucleic acid positive again after discharge. Among the 918 patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for two consecutive times, 24 (2.61%) were positive again, which was significantly higher than that of the patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for three consecutive times (0.75%, 4/534; chi2=6.21, P=0.012 7). Conclusion The throat swab nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 has a certain proportion of false negative results, which is one of the reasons for COVID-19 patients are found nucleic acid positive again after discharge. Multiple and continuous tests by different testers are recommended before discharge, and negative nucleic acid test for three or more consecutive times can reduce the incidence of nucleic acid positive results again after discharge.Copyright © 2020 Second Military Medical University Press.

0	An adult with COVID-19 kawasaki-like syndrome and ocular manifestations. Purpose: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and its associated infection known as COVID-19 have resulted in a global pandemic. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are nonspecific and include hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, secretions, and eyelid edema. There is a paucity in the literature regarding COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes which may also include ocular manifestations. Observations: In pediatric patients, conjunctivitis has been recently reported in association with a multisystem inflammatory condition related to COVID-19 that shares features with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. We describe the clinical course of an adult patient with symptoms and signs consistent with a Kawasaki-like syndrome. Conclusions and Importance: To our knowledge, this report may be the first case of a Kawasaki-like syndrome in an adult with COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020	false

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In January the disease spread rapidly to other regions and beyond Chinese borders until it reached Italy where, on February 21, the first case of non-imported contagion was found. On the same date, as the commercial activities were still regularly open, the dinner, which saw as protagonists the participants of this retrospective study, took place. Of the 49 people attending the event, 47 joined the study. The participants of this study were all males, with an average age of 57 years old, all asymptomatic during the dinner. The participants voluntarily underwent serological or swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 and answered questions from our telephone interview. From the data obtained it emerges that 26 people (55.3%), after the dinner, developed one or more symptoms. The most frequently encountered symptom was fever, present in 76.9% of the symptomatic. 26 people were positive on the diagnostic tests (55.3% of the total examined), 24 of them were symptomatic. The conceivable R0 (the basic reproduction number) is higher than the one present in the literature (7.7 vs 3.8), this is probably due to the conditions in which the dinner took place (not ventilated environment, absence of safety distances, absence of personal protective equipment).	false
0	Low molecular weight heparin in COVID-19 patients prevents delirium and shortens hospitalization. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 patients present with delirium during their hospitalization., AIMS: To assess the incidence of delirium in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and analyze the possible association with demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacological factors., METHODS: COVID-19 patients were assessed for clinical signs of delirium and administered the assessment test for delirium and cognitive impairment (4AT) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scales., RESULTS: Out of the 56 patients of our cohort, 14 (25.0%) experienced delirium. The use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/daily) was less frequent in patients with delirium (p = 0.004) and was accompanied by lower C reactive protein (CRP) levels (p = 0.006)., DISCUSSION: The use of LMWH was associated with absence of delirium, independently of comorbidities and age., CONCLUSIONS: The use of LMWH may help preventing the occurrence of delirium in COVID-19 patients, with possible reduction of length of stay in the hospital and sequelae.	false

The study of climate and respiratory viral infections using big data may enable the recognition and interpretation of relationships between disease occurrence and climatic variables. In this study, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were used to identify Human respiratory coronaviruses (HCoV). infections in patients below 10 years of age with respiratory infections who visited Dankook University Hospital in Cheonan, South Korea, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Out of the 9010 patients who underwent respiratory virus real-time reverse transcription qPCR test, 364 tested positive for HCoV infections. Among these 364 patients, 72.8% (n = 265) were below 10 years of age. Data regarding the frequency of infections was used to uncover the seasonal pattern of the two viral strains, which was then compared with local meteorological data for the same time period. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 showed high infection rates in patients below 10 years of age. There was a negative relationship between HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections with air temperature and wind-chill temperatures. Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 rates of infection were positively related to atmospheric pressure, while HCoV-229E was also positively associated with particulate matter concentrations. Our results suggest that climatic variables affect the rate in which children below 10 years of age are infected with HCoV. These findings may help to predict when prevention strategies may be most effective.	false

0	Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection after exposure and post-symptom onset. Background: Timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a prerequisite for treatment and prevention. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated. Method: Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results: The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively. The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure (d.p.e.) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset (d.p.o.), respectively. The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6 d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7 d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared with IgM and IgG (33.3% for both; p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 933%, respectively, 2 weeks later. When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays. Conclusions: A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic-specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.	false
0	Serum interleukin-6 is an indicator for severity in 901 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a cohort study. BACKGROUND: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was proposed to be associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study aimed to explore the kinetics of IL-6 levels, validate this association in COVID-19 patients, and report preliminary data on the efficacy of IL-6 receptor blockade., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institutional study of 901 consecutive confirmed cases. Serum IL-6 concentrations were tested on admission and/or during hospital stay. Tocilizumab was given to 16 patients with elevated IL-6 concentration., RESULTS: 366 patients were defined as common cases, 411 patients as severe, and 124 patients as critical according to the Chinese guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The median concentration of IL-6 was < 1.5 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-2.15), 1.85 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-5.21), and 21.55 pg/ml (IQR 6.47-94.66) for the common, severe, and critical groups respectively (P < 0.001). The follow-up kinetics revealed serum IL-6 remained high in critical patients even when cured. An IL-6 concentration higher than 37.65 pg/ml was predictive of in-hospital death (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.95-0.99], P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 95.7%. In the 16 patients who received tocilizumab, IL-6 concentrations were significantly increased after administration, and survival outcome was not significantly different from that of propensity-score matched counterparts (n = 53, P = 0.12)., CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 should be included in diagnostic work-up to stratify disease severity, but the benefit of tocilizumab needs further confirmation. Trial registration retrospectively registered.	false
0	ORAL LESIONS IN A PATIENT WITH HYPER IMMUNOGLOBULIN M: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT. Introduction: Hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndromes are a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by deficiencies in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). Patients with HIGM are predisposed to infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant complications. We describe a case of a 21-year-old male with HIGM presenting with fever and severe oral ulcers. Case Description: A 21-year-old male with HIGM due to a CD40L mutation on immunoglobulin therapy was admitted for 4-week history of painful erosive oral lesions, sore throat, and fever. He had deep ulcers on his hard palate, tonsils, and tongue that worsened despite treatment with valacyclovir and azithromycin as an outpatient. Neutrophil counts were normal. Blood and respiratory cultures were negative; one out of two throat fungal cultures showed Candida albicans. Biopsy of the ulcers was negative for fungal elements and HSV. COVID-19 PCR was negative, but COVID-19 IgM to the receptor-binding domain was positive (1:80). IgG was negative, which was expected with HIGM. The patient was treated with acyclovir, fluconazole, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole while undergoing infectious work-up. He continued to have fevers with no improvement in stomatitis. After adding prednisone, his ulcers and fever quickly resolved. Discussion(s): This remains an unclear case of chronic fevers and severe oral ulcers in a patient with HIGM. Candida albicans was unlikely to be the cause. Surprisingly, COVID-19 IgM was positive, suggesting that an infection had occurred. Mucosal involvement has been increasingly reported with COVID-19, and lesions may be more severe in patients with primary immunodeficiency. Steroids may be an effective therapy once other infections are excluded. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Evolution to Online Education around the globe during a SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: Do develop and underdeveloped cope alike?. Background: Educational institutes around the globe in this 21st century is facing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus infectious disease. They are required to conduct online learning to avoid face to face contact in emergency scenarios such as COVID-19 pandemic and continuing academic year while keeping social distancing. Students need to adapt to new roles of learning through information technology to succeed in academics amid COVID-19., Objective: However, access to the impact of access & use of online learning resources, to what extent, these students are satisfied with online learning amid COVID-19 particularly in handling new challenges are critical to explore. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed to assess and compare the access & use of online learning of Bruneians and Pakistanis amid enforced lockdown imposed by the governments using a five-items satisfaction scale underlying existing literature., Method: For this, a cross-sectional study was done in the first half of June 2020 after the pandemic situation among 320 students' across Pakistan and Brunei and strata with a pre-defined questionnaire. Data were analyzed with statistical software package SPSS 2.0., Results: The finding showed that there is a relationship between students' satisfaction and access & use of online learning. Outcomes of the survey suggest that Bruneian are more satisfied (50%) with the use of online learning amid lockdown as compared to Pakistanis (35.9%). Living in the Urban area as compared to a rural area is also a major factor contributing to satisfaction with the access and use of online learning for both Bruneian and Pakistanis. Moreover, previous experience with the use of online learning is observed prevalent among Bruneians (P=.000), while among friends and family is using online learning (P=.000) were encouraging factors contributed to satisfaction with the use of online learning among Pakistanis amid COVID-19. Correlation results suggest that access and use factors of online learning amid COVID-19 were positively associated with satisfaction among both populations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Bruneian is more satisfied with Internet access (r=.437, P<.000) and affordability of gadgets ((r=.577, P<.000) as compare to Pakistanis((r=.176, P<.050) and (r=.156, P<.050).  Conclusion:  The study suggested that it is crucial for the government and other policymakers worldwide to address access and use of online learning resources of their populace amid pandemic.

0	SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX OCCURRING IN CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Disorders of the Pleura Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: A spontaneous pneumothorax is an abnormal atraumatic accumulation of air within the pleural space. It is classified as primary or secondary pneumothorax with multiple associated precipitants or risk factors(1). Here we present a case of spontaneous pneumothorax following COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Hispanic male, known to have hypertension, presented to the emergency room for dyspnea for one day. This was associated with a non-productive cough, fever and pleuritic left-sided chest pain. He denied any smoking history, recent travel, trauma or ill-contacts. There was no known history of lung disease, autoimmune illnesses or family history of pneumothorax. He reported only taking hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. Initial vitals were normal, except a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Pertinent examination findings were, he was of normal height with tachypnea and diminished air entry over the left hemithorax. Laboratory results were positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab, with mild leukocytosis, normal procalcitonin and lactic acid. The interleukin-6 level (45.13 pg/mL), ferritin, CPK, LDH and ESR were elevated. Initial chest x-ray and computer tomography (CT) chest showed 30-40% left pneumothorax with patchy bilateral and peripheral coalescing infiltrates, typical of COVID-19 of mild to moderate severity, with a CT severity score (CT-SS) of 12 out of 40. He subsequently had left pigtail placement and was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by spontaneous pneumothorax. He was started on antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine and placed on contact and droplet isolation. Ultimately, influenza oropharyngeal swab, urine antigens for mycoplasma and legionella, HIV, collagen vascular screen and blood cultures were otherwise unremarkable. After 8 days, he clinically improved with complete resolution of the pneumothorax post pigtail removal. DISCUSSION: In the United States, the incidence of adult males with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is 7.4-18/100,000 or 6.3/100,000, respectively(2). There are several known risk factors for pneumothorax such as smoking, tall stature, family history and certain genetic disorders. Our index case, with the exception of male gender, exhibited none of these precipitants and had no known history of lung disease or any other risk factors for spontaneous pneumothorax. Sun et al,(3) proposed that diffuse alveolar injury due to COVID-19 may increase the risk of alveolar rupture resulting in pneumothoraces. Another theory included a prolonged cough that is associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION(S): Healthcare providers should consider patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to be, directly or indirectly, predisposed to spontaneous pneumothoraces. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported local presentation of spontaneous pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Reference #1: McKnight CL, Burns B. Pneumothorax.

0	"[Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 PCR Positive Cases in the Pediatric Emergency Department]. In December 2019, a previously unknown type of coronavirus was detected in China and named as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)"". The World Health Organization has named the SARS-CoV-2 related as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and declared it as a pandemic. There is a limited data about the COVID-19 disease for the pediatric patients. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department with the suspicion of COVID-19. Between March 11 and June 16, 2020, patients aged between 1 month-18 years admitted to the pediatric emergency department and who have an indication for sampling for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with the suspicion of COVID-19 according to the current guidelines published by the Ministry of Health were included in the study. The demographic characteristics, symptoms, durations and the history of contact with the suspected/definite COVID-19 cases were questioned in the patients with positive results. Physical examination, laboratory and imaging data of the patients were recorded. According to clinical severity, patients were divided into five groups. Treatment methods, ward/intensive care unit admission, length of stay at hospital, and prognosis were recorded. Of the 237 patients included in the study, 45 (18.9%) of the samples were positive and 192 (81.1%) were negative. There was a history of contact with COVID-19 positive case in 38 (85.6%) of COVID-19 PCR positive patients. The mean time for onset of symptoms after contact was 3.5 +/- 1.7 days. Twenty-one of the patients (46.6%) were asymptomatic and the most common symptom was fever (34.1%) and cough (27.3%). Of the patients whose laboratory tests were requested, lymphopenia wasdetected in 50% and 52.3% of procalcitonin, 23.5% of C-reactive protein and 64.7% of D-dimer values were found to be high. Chest radiography was obtained from 45.4% of the patients; 90.0% were evaluated as normal, bronchovascular change, pleural effusion and consolidation were detected in one of each (5.0%) patient. Thorax computed tomography (CT) was obtained from 4 (9.0%) patients. One patient had normal CT findings, two patients had consolidation, one patient had peripheral ground-glass appearance and one patient had pleural effusion. Antibiotics were started in 38.6% of the patients and the most commonly used antibiotic was azithromycin (34.1%). Oseltamivir was started in one (2.3%) patient, and 10 (24.7%) patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. There were no serious and critical cases according to the clinical severity. Pediatric patients constitute a small part of COVID-19 individuals in the community, and a significant part of them are asymptomatic, and patients who are symptomatic present with a mild clinic. In our study, most of the patients had a history of contact with COVID-19 positive cases, therefore, it should be questioned when evaluating a pediatric patient. There were no specific findings for COVID-19 positive patients in terms of laboratory and radiology."	false
0	Early outcomes of Stanford type A aortic dissection under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: a multicentre study from Hubei province. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to compare the short-term outcomes of Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD), during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with those during normal times and summarize our perioperative management experience of patients with TAAD in the context of COVID-19., METHODS: From 17 January 2020 to 8 March 2020, a total of 27 patients with TAAD were operated on in 8 cardiovascular surgery centres in Hubei Province (COVID-19 group). The data from 91 patients with TAAD from the same centres during the same period last year were extracted from the Hubei Cardiac Surgery Registration System (control group). A propensity score matched subgroup of 26 pairs (1:2) was identified. Perioperative data and short-term outcomes were assessed., RESULTS: Nine patients in the COVID-19 group were categorized as suspicious for the disease (9/27, 33.3%), and others were excluded (18/27, 66.7%). No one was laboratory confirmed preoperatively. The average waiting, cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times were longer in the COVID-19 group (22.9 +/- 8.3 vs 9.7 +/- 4.0 h, P < 0.001; 135 +/- 36 vs 103 +/- 45 min, P = 0.003; 24 +/- 9 vs 17 +/- 8 min, P < 0.001, respectively). The 30-day or in-hospital deaths were 3.8% in both groups (P = 1.0). The COVID-19 group was associated with longer ventilation and intensive care unit times (81 +/- 71 vs 45 +/- 19 h, P < 0.001; 7.4 +/- 3.8 vs 4.5 +/- 2.7 days; P < 0.001, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications such as stroke, neurological deficit, acute kidney injury, pulmonary infection and reoperation. Serum antibody tests for those patients showed 7 out of 9 suspected cases were Immunoglobulin G positive. No cross-infection occurred in other patients or associated medical staff., CONCLUSIONS: With adequate preparation and appropriate protection, satisfactory early outcomes can be achieved after emergency operations for patients with TAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Effect of Triple Combination Therapy With Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine on QT Interval and Arrhythmic Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. Introduction: No data are provided about the effect of triple combination therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPN/RTN), hydroxychloroquine (HQ) and azithromycin (AZT) on corrected QT (QTc) interval and arrhythmic risk, in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to describe the incidence of extreme QTc interval prolongation among COVID-19 patients on this experimental treatment and to identify the clinical features associated with extreme QTc prolongation., Materials and Methods: Data of 87 COVID-19 patients, treated with triple combination including LPN/RTN, HQ and AZT, were analyzed. QT interval was obtained by the tangent method and corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula. Extreme QTc interval prolongation was considered an absolute QTc interval >= 500 ms or an increase in QTc intervals of 60 ms or greater (DELTAQTc >= 60 ms) compared with baseline., Results: Hypertension (66.7%) and diabetes (25.3%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities. Twenty patients (23%) showed extreme QTc interval prolongation; no clinical, electrocardiographic or pharmacological characteristics have been associated to extreme QTc prolongation, except the history of ischemic stroke (P= 0,007). One torsade de pointes (TdP) in patient with QTc extreme prolongation (QTc: 560 ms) after 5 days of therapy was recorded., Conclusions: We observed a high incidence of extreme QTc interval prolongation among COVID-19 patients on triple combination therapy. Since the incidence of malignant arrhythmias seems to be not negligible, a careful electrocardiographic monitoring would be advisable.

0	Clinical time course of COVID-19, its neurological manifestation and some thoughts on its management. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. COVID-19 runs its course in two phases, the initial incubation phase and later clinical symptomatic phase. Patients in the initial incubation phase often have insidious clinical symptoms, but they are still highly contagious. At the later clinical symptomatic phase, the immune system is fully activated and the disease may enter the severe infection stage in this phase. Although many patients are known for their respiratory symptoms, they had neurological symptoms in their first 1-2 days of clinical symptomatic phase, and ischaemic stroke occurred 2 weeks after the onset of the clinical symptomatic phase. The key is to prevent a patient from progressing to this severe infection from mild infection. We are sharing our experience on prevention and management of COVID-19.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

0	Fast and Purification-Free Characterization of Bio-Nanoparticles in Biological Media by Electrical Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Hyphenated with Multi-Angle Light Scattering and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis Detection. Accurate physico-chemical characterization of exosomes and liposomes in biological media is challenging due to the inherent complexity of the sample matrix. An appropriate purification step can significantly reduce matrix interferences, and thus facilitate analysis of such demanding samples. Electrical Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (EAF4) provides online sample purification while simultaneously enabling access to size and Zeta potential of sample constituents in the size range of approx. 1-1000 nm. Hyphenation of EAF4 with Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) detection adds high resolution size and number concentration information turning this setup into a powerful analytical platform for the comprehensive physico-chemical characterization of such challenging samples. We here present EAF4-MALS hyphenated with NTA for the analysis of liposomes and exosomes in complex, biological media. Coupling of the two systems was realized using a flow splitter to deliver the sample at an appropriate flow speed for the NTA measurement. After a proof-of-concept study using polystyrene nanoparticles, the combined setup was successfully applied to analyze liposomes and exosomes spiked into cell culture medium and rabbit serum, respectively. Obtained results highlight the benefits of the EAF4-MALS-NTA platform to study the behavior of these promising drug delivery vesicles under in vivo like conditions.	false

0	Detecting COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application. Background: As many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention., Methods: We performed modelling on longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between 24 March and 29 September, 2020. Combining a symptom-based predictive model for COVID-19 positivity and RT-PCR tests provided by the Department of Health we were able to estimate disease incidence, prevalence and effective reproduction number. Geographically granular estimates were used to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots., Findings: More than 2.6 million app users in England provided 115 million daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 170,000 PCR tests. On a national level our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed similar sensitivity to changes as two national community surveys: the ONS and REACT studies. On a geographically granular level, our estimates were able to highlight regions before they were subject to local government lockdowns. Between 12 May and 29 September we were able to flag between 35-80% of regions appearing in the Government's hotspot list., Interpretation: Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide a cost-effective and agile resource to inform a fast-moving pandemic, serving as an independent and complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance., Funding: Zoe Global Limited, Department of Health, Wellcome Trust, EPSRC, NIHR, MRC, Alzheimer's Society., Research in context: Evidence before this study: To identify instances of the use of digital tools to perform COVID-19 surveillance, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles between 1 January and 14 October 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 AND ((mobile application) OR (web tool) OR (digital survey)). Of the 382 results, we found eight that utilised user-reported data to ascertain a user's COVID-19 status. Of these, none sought to provide disease surveillance on a national level, or to compare these predictions to other tools to ascertain their accuracy. Furthermore, none of these papers sought to use their data to highlight geographical areas of concern. Added value of this study: To our knowledge, we provide the first demonstration of mobile technology to provide national-level disease surveillance. Using over 115 million reports from more than 2.6 million users across England, we estimate incidence, prevalence, and the effective reproduction number. We compare these estimates to those from national community surveys to understand the effectiveness of these digital tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate the large number of users can be used to provide disease surveillance with high geographical granularity, potentially providing a valuable source of information for policymakers seeking to understand the spread of the disease. Implications of all the available evidence: Our findings suggest that mobile technology can be used to provide real-time data on the national and local state of the pandemic, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions in a fast-moving pandemic.	false
0	Delirium and encephalopathy in severe COVID-19: A cohort analysis of ICU patients. Background: Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. We aimed at describing delirium and neurological symptoms of COVID-19 in ICU patients. Method(s): We conducted a bicentric cohort study in two French ICUs of Strasbourg University Hospital. All the 150 patients referred for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 between March 3 and May 5, 2020, were included at their admission. Ten patients (6.7%) were excluded because they remained under neuromuscular blockers during their entire ICU stay. Neurological examination, including CAM-ICU, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in some of the patients with delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The primary endpoint was to describe the incidence of delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The secondary endpoints were to describe the characteristics of delirium, to compare the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in patients with and without delirium and/or abnormal neurological symptoms. Result(s): The 140 patients were aged in median of 62 [IQR 52; 70] years old, with a median SAPSII of 49 [IQR 37; 64] points. Neurological examination was normal in 22 patients (15.7%). One hundred eighteen patients (84.3%) developed a delirium with a combination of acute attention, awareness, and cognition disturbances. Eighty-eight patients (69.3%) presented an unexpected state of agitation despite high infusion rates of sedative treatments and neuroleptics, and 89 (63.6%) patients had corticospinal tract signs. Brain MRI performed in 28 patients demonstrated enhancement of subarachnoid spaces in 17/28 patients (60.7%), intraparenchymal, predominantly white matter abnormalities in 8 patients, and perfusion abnormalities in 17/26 patients (65.4%). The 42 electroencephalograms mostly revealed unspecific abnormalities or diffuse, especially bifrontal, slow activity. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed inflammatory disturbances in 18/28 patients, including oligoclonal bands with mirror pattern and elevated IL-6. The CSF RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one patient. The delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were responsible for longer mechanical ventilation compared to the patients without delirium/neurological symptoms. Delirium/neurological symptoms could be secondary to systemic inflammatory reaction to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and relevance: Delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients are a major issue in ICUs, especially in the context of insufficient human and material resources.

0	The clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with cerebral stroke:a retrospective study of 113 cases from one single center. To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with cerebral stroke. A total of 2474 COVID-19 patients from February 10th to March 24th, 2020 were admitted and treated in two branches (Optic Valley and Sino-French New City branch) of the Tongji Hospital. Data on the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with or without cerebral stroke were collected and comparatively analysed. Of the 2474 COVID-19 patients, 113 (4.7%) patients had cerebral stroke, and 25 (1.0%) patients had new-onset stroke. Eighty-eight (77.9%) patients in the previous-stroke group had cerebral ischaemia, while 25 (22.1%) patients in the new-onset stroke group had cerebral ischaemia. Most COVID-19 patients with stroke were elderly with more comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases than patients without stroke. Laboratory examinations showed hypercoagulation and elevated serum parameters such as IL-6, cTnI, NT pro-BNP and BUN. Consciousness disorders, a long disease course and poor prognosis were also more commonly observed in stroke patients. The mortality rate of stroke patients was almost double (12.4% vs 6.9%) that of patients without stroke. In addition, age, male sex and hypertension were independent predictors for new cerebral stroke in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the high risk of new-onset stroke must be taken into consideration when treating COVID-19 patients with an elderly age combined with a history of hypertension. These patients are more vulnerable to multiorgan dysfunction and an overactivated inflammatory response, in turn leading to an unfavourable outcome and higher mortality rate.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Time-related changes in sex distribution of COVID-19 incidence proportion in Italy. Background: Variable sex-disaggregated data on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence proportion (IP) have been reported in different datasets and studies. Factors explaining the inconsistent distribution of COVID-19 among sexes are still unclear., Objectives: This study aimed to analyse time-related variation of sex-disaggregated COVID-19 IP in Italy since March 9th to May 11th 2020, and to test its association with the frequency of swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., Study design: Sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 cases were collected from Italian publicly accessible databases along with undisaggregated data on the number of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests. Crude and adjusted associations between the frequency of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing and male-to-female (M/F) ratio of COVID-19 IP were performed., Results: COVID-19 IP increased progressively in both sexes. Sex prevalence of COVID-19 IP reversed over time, with the M/F ratio of COVID-19 IP having passed from 1,73 to 0,91. The mean number of daily swabs for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test increased progressively until reaching a plateau in the last three weeks of the study period. The M/F ratio of COVID-19 IP inversely correlated with the number of daily swabs for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test (r = -0,87, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for the median age of COVID-19 cases (beta = -0,66, p < 0,001)., Conclusions: Time-related changes of sex distribution of COVID-19 IP in Italy are strongly influenced by the number of swabs testing for SARS-CoV-2. Whether gender-related disparities in the access to the diagnosis of COVID-19 may explain such a result need to be explored. Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	Safety, efficacy and patterns of failure after single fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastases. PURPOSE: Fewer attendances for radiotherapy results in increased efficiency and less foot traffic within a radiotherapy department. We investigated outcomes after single fraction (SF) SBRT in patients with oligometastatic disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2010 and June 2019, patients who received SF SBRT to 1-5 sites of oligometastatic disease were included in this retrospective study. The primary objective was to describe patterns of first failure after SBRT. Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS) progression-free survival (PFS), high-grade treatment-related toxicity (>=grade 3 CTCAE) and freedom from systemic therapy (FFST). RESULT(S): In total, 371 patients with 494 extracranial oligometastases received SF SBRT ranging from 16Gy to 28Gy. The most common primary malignancies were prostate (n=107), lung (n=63), kidney (n=52), gastrointestinal (n=51), and breast cancers (n = 42). The median follow-up was 3.1 years. The 1, 3 and 5 year OS was 93%, 69% and 55%, respectively, PFS was 48%, 19% and 14%, respectively, and FFST was 70%, 43% and 35%, respectively. Twelve patients (3%) developed grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicity, with no grade 5 toxicity. As the first site of failure, the cumulative incidence of local failure (irrespective of other failures) at 1, 3 and 5-years was 4%, 8% and 8%, locoregional relapse at the primary was 10%, 18% and 18%, and distant failure was 45%, 66% and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): SF SBRT is safe, effective, and a significant proportion of patients remain FFST for several years after therapy. This approach could be considered in resource constrained or bundled payment environments. Locoregional failure of the primary site is the second most common pattern of failure, suggesting a role for optimization of primary control during metastasis-directed therapy.Copyright © 2020.

0	Cerebral venous thrombosis in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy: A case report. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is ongoing pandemic. While a majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection shows asymptomatic or mild disease, hospitalized patients can develop critical condition, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Some cases deteriorate into sever systemic disease and multiorgan failure. Many patients of severe COVID-19 show hypercoagulable state and complicate with venous thromboembolism and atrial thrombosis. We herein reported a case of COVID-19 who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) co-incidence with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). A 56-year-old Japanese man was presented with fever and malaise and diagnosed with COVID-19. He was treated with ciclesonide and azithromycin, but his respiratory condition deteriorated. Thus, systemic corticosteroids and favipiravir were initiated and these treatments resulted in afebrile state, improving malaise and respiratory failure. However, he suddenly developed severe headache and vomiting with increased concentration of D-dimer. Brain CT and MRI showed typical images of CVT in the left transvers sinus and CT pulmonary angiography showed PE. Administration of unfractionated heparin followed by edoxaban treatment reduced the levels of D-dimer and improved his clinical presentation and thrombosis. Monitoring coagulopathy is important in COVID-19 patients and in case of venous thromboembolism, including cerebral venous system, appropriate anticoagulant therapy should be initiated.

0	Management of COVID-19 myopericarditis with reversal of cardiac dysfunction after blunting of cytokine storm: a case report. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a syndrome that has been associated with multiple cardiac complications including myopericarditis. The pathophysiology and treatment for myopericarditis in the setting of COVID-19 infection is still under investigation., Case summary: We present a case of a 60-year-old male admitted for dyspnoea due to COVID-19. He developed new ST-segment elevation, elevated cardiac enzymes, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and high inflammatory markers in the setting of haemodynamic and respiratory collapse from the viral illness. He was diagnosed with COVID-19-induced myopericarditis. He showed rapid clinical improvement with a rapid wean off pressure support, resolution of electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and recovery of left ventricular systolic function following treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone., Discussion: COVID-19's complex and devastating complications continue to create new challenges for clinicians. Cardiac complications, specifically, have been shown to be a signal for worse prognosis in these patients. IVIG and steroids can inhibit the inflammatory cascade and decrease myocardial injury, with implications in treatment of severe myopericarditis. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	COVID-19 IN A PATIENT WITH CVID AND CONTRAINDICATIONS TO SEVERAL POTENTIAL TREATMENTS. Introduction: Despite nearly 18 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 thus far, there is minimal information regarding treatment in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), such as presented here. Case Description: A 59-year-old male with CVID was receiving IVIG infusion when RN noted lethargy, fever, and cough. Chest Xray showed bilateral lower lobe opacities. Labs significant for lymphopenia to 0.5, CRP 4.9, CK 23, ESR 22. SARS-CoV-2 testing positive. Given history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, severe back pain, and 10.5-pack-year smoking history, patient requested to be DNR/DNI. Patient eventually required high flow oxygen with 70% FiO2 at 35L/min. Hydroxychloroquine initiated, but Qtc became prolonged. He received vitamin C and enrolled in convalescent plasma trial. Patient's respiratory status worsened with increasing hypoxia. D-dimer increased to 7.63, ferritin to 2862, and LDH to 533. Prone position poorly tolerated. BiPAP recommended, but patient increasingly anxious and declined, requesting to go home to die. Within 2 days of receiving plasma, mentation improved; within 9 days oxygen requirements decreased; discharge occurred after 24 days in the hospital. Patient subsequently admitted for severe back pain and found to be still SARS-CoV-2 positive, 8.5 weeks from initial test. However, he continued asymptomatic on room air with improved chest xray. Discussion(s): This patient had contraindications to several potential medications, physical limitations with proning, and slow recovery after receiving convalescent plasma, though he did not require ventilator support. There was evidence of hyperinflammation secondary to COVID-19, and it is unknown to what degree immunodeficiency may have been protective against a severe cytokine storm. Further investigation necessary.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Persisting alterations of iron homeostasis in COVID-19 are associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and poor patients' performance: a prospective observational cohort study. Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently associated with hyperinflammation and hyperferritinemia. The latter is related to increased mortality in COVID-19. Still, it is not clear if iron dysmetabolism is mechanistically linked to COVID-19 pathobiology. Method(s): We herein present data from the ongoing prospective, multicentre, observational CovILD cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04416100), which systematically follows up patients after COVID-19. 109 participants were evaluated 60 days after onset of first COVID-19 symptoms including clinical examination, chest computed tomography and laboratory testing. Result(s): We investigated subjects with mild to critical COVID-19, of which the majority received hospital treatment. 60 days after disease onset, 30% of subjects still presented with iron deficiency and 9% had anemia, mostly categorized as anemia of inflammation. Anemic patients had increased levels of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein and survived a more severe course of COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia was still present in 38% of all individuals and was more frequent in subjects with preceding severe or critical COVID-19. Analysis of the mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a correlation of increased ferritin and cytokine mRNA expression in these patients. Finally, persisting hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe lung pathologies in computed tomography scans and a decreased performance status as compared to patients without hyperferritinemia. Discussion(s): Alterations of iron homeostasis can persist for at least two months after the onset of COVID-19 and are closely associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and impaired physical performance. Determination of serum iron parameters may thus be a easy to access measure to monitor the resolution of COVID-19.

0	Fungemia in COVID -19 ICU Patients, a Single Medical Center Experience. A known proportion of patients who are admitted for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires Intensive Care Unit (ICU) level of care. Prolonged ICU stay is a risk factor for the development of nosocomial candidemia. The current study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia among patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19. Patients who developed nosocomial candidemia were identified, and their clinical course was reported. A 1:3 case control matching was used to identify non-candidemia patients who served as controls. 89 patients were admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 during the study period. The incidence of nosocomial candidemia was 8.9% (n=8). Case-control matching identified 24 patients with similar disease severity at the time of ICU admission. Median time to first isolation of yeast was 26 days. Candidemia patients reported longer median ICU stay than controls. (40 vs. 10 days, p=0.004). In hospital death rates were comparable in both groups (38% vs. 54%, p=0.548). Prolonged mechanical ventilation support was associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia.

0	Trend of Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients in a Quarantine Facility. BACKGROUND: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction has been reported as characteristic symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study evaluated olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in mild COVID-19 patients using validated assessment methods., METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted for mild COVID-19 patients who were isolated at the Gyeonggi International Living and Treatment Support Center (LTSC), Korea. Olfactory function was assessed using the Korean version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT). Gustatory function was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale and 6-n-propylthiouracil, phenylthiocarbamide, and control strips. All patients underwent nasal and oral cavity endoscopic examination., RESULTS: Of the 62 patients at the LTSC, 15 patients (24.2%) complained of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction on admission. Four of 10 patients who underwent functional evaluation did not have general symptoms and 2 were asymptomatic. The mean short version of QOD-negative statements and QOD-visual analogue scale scores were 13 +/- 6 and 4.7 +/- 3.6, respectively. The mean CC-SIT score was 8 +/- 2. No patients showed anatomical abnormalities associated with olfactory dysfunction on endoscopic examination. The mean Likert scale score for function was 8 +/- 2, and there were no abnormal lesions in the oral cavity of any patient., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was 24.2% in mild COVID-19 patients. All patients had hyposmia due to sensorineural olfactory dysfunction, which was confirmed using validated olfactory and gustatory evaluation methods and endoscopic examination. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may be characteristic indicators of mild COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.	false
0	Deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Objective: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused devastating morbidity and mortality worldwide. In particular, thromboembolic complications have emerged as a key threat for patients with COVID-19. We assessed our experience with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with COVID-19 who had undergone upper or lower extremity venous duplex ultrasonography at an academic health system in New York City from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020 with follow-up through May 12, 2020. A cohort of hospitalized patients without COVID-19 (non-COVID-19) who had undergone venous duplex ultrasonography from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 was used for comparison. The primary outcome was DVT. The secondary outcomes included pulmonary embolism, in-hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit, and antithrombotic therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for DVT and mortality. Result(s): Of 443 patients (COVID-19, n = 188; and non-COVID-19, n = 255) who had undergone venous duplex ultrasonography, the COVID-19 cohort had had a greater incidence of DVT (31% vs 19%; P =.005) than had the non-COVID-19 cohort. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was not significantly different statistically between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts (8% vs 4%; P =.105). The DVT location in the COVID-19 group was more often distal (63% vs 29%; P <.001) and bilateral (15% vs 4%; P <.001). The duplex ultrasound findings had a significant impact on the antithrombotic plan; 42 patients (72%) with COVID-19 in the DVT group had their therapy escalated and 49 (38%) and 3 (2%) had their therapy escalated and deescalated in the non-DVT group, respectively (P <.001). Within the COVID-19 cohort, the D-dimer level was significantly greater in the DVT group at admission (2746 ng/mL vs 1481 ng/mL; P =.004) and at the duplex examination (6068 ng/mL vs 3049 ng/mL; P <.01). On multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-4.87; P =.035), intensive care unit admission (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.02-11.44; P =.046), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.01-30.13; P =.049) were independently associated with DVT. Conclusion(s): Given the high incidence of venous thromboembolic events in this population, we support the decision to empirically initiate therapeutic anticoagulation for patients with a low bleeding risk and severe COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasonography should be reserved for patients with a high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism for whom anticoagulation therapy could result in life-threatening consequences. Further study of patients with COVID-19 is warranted to elucidate the etiology of vascular thromboembolic events and guide the prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for these patients.Copyright © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery	false
0	Factors of Severity in Patients with COVID-19: Cytokine/Chemokine Concentrations, Viral Load, and Antibody Responses. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from mild to critical diseases. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of viral load and host immune response throughout the disease course depending on disease severity. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed viral load, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, and cytokines/chemokines during the disease course, and identified the factors related to severity. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and plasma specimens were obtained from 31 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Viral RNA in NP specimens was quantified by reverse transcription-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokines/chemokines in plasma specimens were analyzed by ELISA and cytometric bead array. The viral load in patients with COVID-19 peaked at the early stage of the disease and continuously decreased. Severe and critical cases showed higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding than asymptomatic and mild cases. Whereas plasma IgG was gradually increased and maintained during hospitalization, plasma IgM peaked at 3 weeks after symptom onset and dissipated. The antibody response in severe and critical cases was slightly delayed but stronger than those in others. High levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma-induced protein-10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and interleukin-6 at 5-10 days from symptom onset were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our data indicate that high viral load in the respiratory tract and excessive production of cytokines and chemokines between 1 and 2 weeks from the symptom onset were significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19.	false
0	"Infusion of HLA-matched and static magnetic field-exposed allogenic lymphocytes treating lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm syndrome: A treatment proposal for COVID-19 patients. Among haematological parameters of patients seriously ill with the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), leucocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and the abnormal release of circulating cytokines, termed cytokine storm syndrome (CSS, also known as cytokine release syndrome or CRS), were found associated with disease severity. In particular, according to the serum cytokine profiling, pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) were observed to be considerably higher in patients experiencing respiratory distress, septic shock and/or multi-organ failure, namely ""critical cases"" requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, very often resulting in death. Interestingly, the production of these cytokines from human lymphocytes was found to be modulated by exposure of 24 h to a 554.2-553.8 mT inhomogeneous static magnetic field (SMF), which elicits IL-10 and suppresses IL-6. Thus, herein, with the aim of restoring lymphocyte count and physiological serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10, the infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched and SMF-exposed allogenic lymphocytes is proposed for the first time as an easy and affordable treatment option for COVID-19 patients. Even if the count of lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients is very low, SMF exposure may be a valuable tool for reprogramming autologous lymphocytes towards physiological conditions. Furthermore, the same procedure could be extended to include the whole autologous or allogenic white blood cells (WBCs). Time-varying/pulsed magnetic fields exerting comparable cell effects could also be employed."	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on cancer immunotherapy in Italy: A survey of young oncologists. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the health systems worldwide. Data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients (CPs) undergoing or candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are lacking. We depicted the practice and adaptations in the management of patients with solid tumors eligible or receiving ICIs during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a special focus on Campania region. Methods This survey (25 questions), promoted by the young section of SCITO (Societa Campana di ImmunoTerapia Oncologica) Group, was circulated among Italian young oncologists practicing in regions variously affected by the pandemic: high (group 1), medium (group 2) and low (group 3) prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. For Campania region, the physician responders were split into those working in cancer centers (CC), university hospitals (UH) and general hospitals (GH). Percentages of agreement, among High (H) versus Medium (M) and versus Low (L) group for Italy and among CC, UH and GH for Campania region, were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and chi 2 test for trends relative to the questions with 3 or more options. Results This is the first Italian study to investigate the COVID-19 impact on cancer immunotherapy, unique in its type and very clear in the results. The COVID-19 pandemic seemed not to affect the standard practice in the prescription and delivery of ICIs in Italy. Telemedicine was widely used. There was high consensus to interrupt immunotherapy in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and to adopt ICIs with longer schedule interval. The majority of the responders tended not to delay the start of ICIs; there were no changes in supportive treatments, but some of the physicians opted for delaying surgeries (if part of patients' planned treatment approach). The results from responders in Campania did not differ significantly from the national ones. Conclusion Our study highlights the efforts of Italian oncologists to maintain high standards of care for CPs treated with ICIs, regardless the regional prevalence of COVID-19, suggesting the adoption of similar solutions. Research on patients treated with ICIs and experiencing COVID-19 will clarify the safety profile to continue the treatments, thus informing on the most appropriate clinical conducts.

0	Cardiology and COVID-19: do we have sufficient information?. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which originated in Wuhan (China), transformed into a worldwide pandemic. The short span associated with the spread of the virus and its varied manifestations presents a steep learning curve for many clinicians on the front-line of treatment. Cardiology is one such affected area. This paper details the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease resulting from COVID-19, including its proposed pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes under investigation. The consensus is that COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular injury have a shorter duration from symptom onset to deterioration, higher mortality and higher prevalence in older populations. Diagnosis and intervention for patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities is critical.	false
0	Evaluation of COVID-19 Testing Strategies for Repopulating College and University Campuses: A Decision Tree Analysis. PURPOSE: The optimal approach to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection among college students returning to campus is unknown. Recommendations vary from no testing to two tests per student. This research determined the strategy that optimizes the number of true positives and negatives detected and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests needed., METHODS: A decision tree analysis evaluated five strategies: (1) classifying students with symptoms as having COVID-19, (2) RT-PCR testing for symptomatic students, (3) RT-PCR testing for all students, (4) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting symptomatic students with a negative first test, and (5) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting all students with a negative first test. The number of true positives, true negatives, RT-PCR tests, and RT-PCR tests per true positive (TTP) was calculated., RESULTS: Strategy 5 detected the most true positives but also required the most tests. The percentage of correctly identified infections was 40.6%, 29.0%, 53.7%, 72.5%, and 86.9% for Strategies 1-5, respectively. All RT-PCR strategies detected more true negatives than the symptom-only strategy. Analysis of TTP demonstrated that the repeat RT-PCR strategies weakly dominated the single RT-PCR strategy and that the thresholds for more intensive RT-PCR testing decreased as the prevalence of infection increased., CONCLUSION: Based on TTP, the single RT-PCR strategy is never preferred. If the cost of RT-PCR testing is of concern, a staged approach involving initial testing of all returning students followed by a repeat testing decision based on the measured prevalence of infection might be considered.

0	Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor ACE2 with evolutionarily related coronaviruses. The pandemic COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is spreading very rapidly worldwide. To date, the origin and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. In this study, we conducted comparative analysis among SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships. We found: 1, the SARS-CoV-2 strains analyzed could be divided into 3 clades with regional aggregation; 2, the non-SARS-CoV-2 common coronaviruses that infect humans or other organisms to cause respiratory syndrome and epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis could also be divided into 3 clades; 3, the hosts of the common coronaviruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 were Apodemus chevrieri (a rodent), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), Hypsugo savii (bat) , Camelus bactrianus (camel) and Mustela vison (mink); and 4, the gene sequences of the receptor ACE2 from different hosts could also be divided into 3 clades. The ACE2 gene sequences closest to that of humans in evolution include those from Nannospalax galili (Upper Galilee mountains blind mole rat), Phyllostomus discolor (pale spear-nosed bat), Mus musculus (house mouse), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), and Catharus ustulatus (Swainson's thrush). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from a distant common ancestor with the common coronaviruses but not a branch of any of them, implying that the prevalent pandemic COVID-19 agent SARS-CoV-2 may have existed in a yet to be identified primary host for a long time.	false
0	COVID-19 fulminant myocarditis: a case report. Background: Fulminant myocarditis is a catastrophic disease with high mortality and complications. A viral aetiology is frequent and the implication of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known., Case summary: A 38-year-old woman who recently arrived from Spain presented with palpitations that started suddenly 3 days prior to presentation and were associated with haemodynamic instability, without dyspnoea or chest pain. We found features of myopericarditis on the electrocardiogram and severe systolic dysfunction on the echocardiogram. The chest tomography showed findings which suggested COVID-19 infection, and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. The cardiac magnetic resonance image showed Lake Louise criteria for myocarditis. The patient was treated with immunomodulatory, steroid, and immunoglobulin therapy, with a favourable clinical response., Discussion: The importance of this case lies in highlighting the severe cardiac involvement in a young patient, without previous risk factors, positive for COVID-19, and the favourable response to the medical treatment given.

0	Human Hematopoietic Stem, Progenitor, and Immune Cells Respond Ex Vivo to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein. Despite evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is systemic in nature, there is little known about the effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure has on many host cell types, including primitive and mature hematopoietic cells. The hematopoietic system is responsible for giving rise to the very immune cells that defend against viral infection and is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) which are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to treat hematologic disorders, thus there is a strong need to understand how exposure to the virus may affect hematopoietic cell functions. We examined the expression of ACE2, to which SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to facilitate viral entry, in cord blood derived HSCs/HPCs and in peripheral blood derived immune cell subtypes. ACE2 is expressed in low numbers of immune cells, higher numbers of HPCs, and up to 65% of rigorously defined HSCs. We also examined effects of exposing HSCs/HPCs and immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 S protein ex vivo. HSCs and HPCs expand less effectively and have less functional colony forming capacity when grown with S protein, while peripheral blood monocytes upregulate CD14 expression and show distinct changes in size and granularity. That these effects are induced by recombinant S protein alone and not the infectious viral particle suggests that simple exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may impact HSCs/HPCs and immune cells via S protein interactions with the cells, regardless of whether they can be infected. These data have implications for immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and for HCT. Graphical Abstract * Human HSCs, HPCs, and immune cells express ACE2 on the cell surface, making them potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. * SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which binds to ACE2, induces defects in the colony forming capacity of human HPC and inhibits the expansion of HSC/HPC subpopulations ex vivo. These effects can be at least partially neutralized by treatment with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibody, recombinant human ACE2, or Angiotensin1-7. * S protein also induces aberrant morphological changes in peripheral blood derived monocytes ex vivo. * Thus, there are many different manners in which SARS-CoV-2 virus may impact the functional hematopoietic system, which has important implications for hematological manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e. thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia), immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the era of COVID-19.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study. Background: A cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. Aged population with cardiovascular diseases are more likely be to infected with SARS-CoV-2 and result in more severe outcomes and elevated case-fatality rate. Meanwhile, cardiovascular diseases have a high prevalence in the middle-aged and elderly population. However, despite of several researches in COVID-19, cardiovascular implications related to it still remains largely unclear. Therefore, a specific analysis in regard to cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 patients is in great need. Method(s): In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, 116 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled, who admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command (Wuhan, China) from January 20 to March 8, 2020. The demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records. Data were compared between non-severe and severe cases. Result(s): Of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 58.5 years (IQR, 47.0-69.0), and 36 (31.0%) were female. Hypertension (45 [38.8%]), diabetes (19 [16.4%]), and coronary heart disease (17 [14.7%]) were the most common coexisting conditions. Common symptoms included fever [99 (85.3%)], dry cough (61 [52.6%]), fatigue (60 [51.7%]), dyspnea (52 [44.8%]), anorexia (50 [43.1%]), and chest discomfort (50 [43.1%]). Local and/or bilateral patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 1.0 x 109/L [IQR, 0.7-1.3]) was observed in 66 patients (56.9%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245.5 U/L [IQR, 194.3-319.8]) in 69 patients (59.5%). Hypokalemia occurred in 24 (20.7%) patients. Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases were older (64.0 years [IQR, 53.0-76.0] vs 56.0 years [IQR, 37.0-64.0]), more likely to have comorbidities (35 [63.6%] vs 24 [39.3%]), and more likely to develop acute cardiac injury (19 [34.5%] vs 4 [6.6%]), acute heart failure (18 [32.7%] vs 3 [4.9%]), and ARDS (20 [36.4%] vs 0 [0%]). During hospitalization, the prevalence of new onset hypertension was significantly higher in severe patients (55.2% vs 19.0%) than in non-severe ones. Conclusion(s): In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to occur in middle and aged population with cardiovascular comorbidities. Cardiovascular complications, including new onset hypertension and heart injury were common in severe patients with COVID-19. More detailed researches in cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 are urgently needed to further understand the disease.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Antibody Micropatterned Lubricant-Infused Biosensors Enable Sub-Picogram Immunofluorescence Detection of Interleukin 6 in Human Whole Plasma. Recent studies have shown a correlation between elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations and the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, detection of IL-6 at low concentrations permits early diagnosis of worst-case outcome in viral respiratory infections. Here, a versatile biointerface is presented that eliminates nonspecific adhesion and thus enables immunofluorescence detection of IL-6 in whole human plasma or whole human blood during coagulation, down to a limit of detection of 0.5 pg mL-1 . The sensitivity of the developed lubricant-infused biosensor for immunofluorescence assays in detecting low molecular weight proteins such as IL-6 is facilitated by i) producing a bioink in which the capture antibody is functionalized by an epoxy-based silane for covalent linkage to the fluorosilanized surface and ii) suppressing nonspecific adhesion by patterning the developed bioink into a lubricant-infused coating. The developed biosensor addresses one of the major challenges for biosensing in complex fluids, namely nonspecific adhesion, therefore paving the way for highly sensitive biosensing in complex fluids.Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.	false
0	Acute gastrointestinal injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the world. Most critically ill patients have organ injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, or liver dysfunction. However, few studies on acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) have been reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19., AIM: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of AGI in critically ill patients with COVID-19., METHODS: In this retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-d mortality., RESULTS: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients out of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of these patients, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. Forty (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, and septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, a higher incidence of septic shock and 28-d mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (95%CI: 1.374-2.860; P < 0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95%CI: 1.037-1.379; P = 0.014), and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95%CI: 1.020-1.340; P = 0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above., CONCLUSION: The incidence of AGI was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Patients with worse AGI grades had a higher incidence of septic shock and 28-d mortality.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with diabetes have been identified to be more vulnerable to infection and greater risk for hospitalization. As diabetes is one of the major health issues in Saudi Arabia, the current study describes the perspectives of COVID-19 in people with diabetes and the steps taken by the government to minimize the impact of it. Most patients with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, experience mild illness, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of disease severity and mortality. The government of Saudi Arabia has taken several measures to control and mitigate the effect of the pandemic, as Saudi population gradually returning back to normal life. However, currently there are limited studies from Saudi Arabia on COVID-19 among people with diabetes and the effectiveness of interventions. We emphasize the necessity for comprehensive research, which would provide a better understanding of the incidence of COVID-19 and its association with diabetes to develop evidence-based programs and policies in the country.

0	"Incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease: is prior health education more important than shielding advice during the pandemic?. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major changes in clinical practice on a global scale in order to protect patients. This includes the identification of vulnerable patients who should ""shield"" in order to reduce the likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV2. We used national specialty guidance and an adapted screening tool to risk stratify patients identified from our prescribing and monitoring databases, and identify those needing to shield (score >= 3) using information from departmental letters, online general practice records and recent laboratory investigations. We collated underlying rheumatological conditions and risk factors. Two months into the shielding process, we examined the COVID-19 status of these patients using hospital laboratory records and compared to population level data. Of 887 patients assessed, 248 (28%) scored >= 3 and were sent a standard shielding letter. The most common risk factor in the shielding letter group was age >= 70 years and/or presence of a listed co-morbidity (199 patients). The most common rheumatology conditions were rheumatoid arthritis (69.4%), polymyalgia rheumatica (8.5%) and giant cell arteritis (8.5%). Coronavirus incidence rates were similar in the shielding letter group (0.403%) and in the UK population (0.397%). However, we found a trend towards lower incidence (0.113%) in our whole cohort (RR 0.28, 95%CI 0.04-2.01 for the whole cohort compared to UK population). The trend towards lower incidence in this cohort could be because of prior education regarding general infection risk and response to public health messages. While risk stratification and shielding could be effective, prior education regarding general infection risk and public health messages to enhance health protection behaviours during a pandemic may have equal or more important roles. Key Points * Patients on treatment for rheumatic disorders showed a trend for lower incidence of COVID-19 transmission irrespective of shielding letter status * This could potentially be because of prior education regarding infection risk received when starting on disease-modifying medication * Health education influencing health protection behaviours may be of equal or more importance than shielding information in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2."	false
0	A BALANCING ACT: TREATMENT OF COVID-19 AND CYTOMEGALOVIRUS IN A PATIENT WITH PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY. Introduction: Treatment for SARS-CoV-2 has targeted both the infection, and also inflammatory complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Attempts to control associated hyper-inflammation can cause significant co-morbidities. Specifically, immunomodulation in the setting of COVID-19 can result in co-infection with other pathogens. Case Presentation: A 14-year-old female with combined immunodeficiency secondary to NFkappaB2 haploinsufficiency (p.R853x) complicated by alopecia totalis, granulomatous dermatitis, arthritis, uveitis, and non-cholestatic hepatitis was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. She presented with fever, cough and acute dyspnea requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Imaging confirmed multifocal pneumonia and she tested SARS-CoV-2+. Her chronic adalimumab was held, and she was treated with dexamethasone and convalescent plasma. Worsening respiratory distress prompted further immunomodulation with anakinra. Remdesivir was administered only after improvement in her liver biochemistries. She was weaned to room air, but abruptly developed new fevers and tachypnea again requiring HFNC; further testing revealed CMV viremia and pneumonitis. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, CMV-IgG and additional anakinra therapy led to clinical improvement. Discussion(s): Although immunomodulation may play an important role in COVID-19 treatment, broad immunomodulation herein likely contributed to reactivation of CMV. Dexamethasone further weakened our patient's already dysregulated T-cell response, increasing vulnerability to CMV reactivation. Anakinra appeared to dampen her presumed dysregulated pulmonary inflammation and did not hinder the clearance of CMV. This case highlights that it is critical to perform a detailed infectious evaluation in at-risk patients. Additionally, anakinra is a promising immunomodulator for COVID-19, even in patients with concomitant infections.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Differences of SARS-CoV-2 serological test performance between hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. BACKGROUND: Serological severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays differ in the target antigen specificity, e.g. of antibodies directed against the viral spike or the nucleocapsid protein, and in the spectrum of detected immunoglobulins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases., METHODS: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity scores and earlier follow up blood sampling. Sensitivity of the two IgG assays was comparable in hospitalized patients tested >= 14 days (EI-assay: 88%, CI95% 67.6-99.9; VT-assay: 96%, CI95% 77.7-99.8). In outpatient COVID-19 cases sensitivity was significantly lower in the VT-assay (86.2%, CI95% 74.8-93.1) compared with the EI-assay (98.5%, CI95% 90.6-99.9). Assays for IgA and IgM demonstrated a lack of specificity or sensitivity., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may need to be optimized to produce reliable results in outpatient COVID-19 cases who are low or even asymptomatic. Assays for IgA and IgM have limited diagnostic performance and do not prove an additional value for population-based screening approaches. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

0	Disulfiram Ethanol Reaction with Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer: An Exploratory Study. AIMS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence and clinical manifestation of disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER) and isopropanol toxicity (IT) in patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram. Alcohol-based hand rub contains either ethanol or isopropanol or both. COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide scale usage of sanitizers. Patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram, might experience disulfiram ethanol like reactions with alcohol-based sanitizers., METHODS: We telephonically contacted 339 patients, prescribed disulfiram between January 2014 and March 2020. The assessment pertained to the last 3 months (i.e. third week of March to third week of June 2020)., RESULT: The sample consisted of middle-aged men with a mean 16 years of alcohol dependence. Among the 82 (24%) patients adherent to disulfiram, 42 (12.3%) were using alcohol-based hand rubs. Out of these, a total of eight patients (19%; 95% CI 9-33) had features suggestive of DER; four of whom also had features indicative of IT. Five patients (62.5%) had mild and self-limiting symptoms. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by three (37.5%). Severe reactions were observed with exposure to sanitizers in greater amounts, on moist skin or through inhalation., CONCLUSION: Patients on disulfiram should be advised to use alternate methods of hand hygiene.

0	The first cancer patient with COVID-19 in Slovakia. BACKGROUND: In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and affected health care worldwide. Patients with cancer and other comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this infection., CASE: In this case report we present a 75-year-old patient with a localized gastric adenocarcinoma, currently treated by perioperative chemotherapy regimen, who had an rT-PCR proven novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed in order to assess disease severity; however, the findings were not altered in accordance with the findings associated with COVID-19 disease., RESULTS: On the first hospital day the patient had a low grade fever with chills. Subsequently a pharmacological therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was started. After pharmacologic and symptomatic treatment, the patient was reassessed for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results. At discharge, the patient was ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine. After 57 days of follow-up, the patient underwent a new rapid antibody test by Acro Biotech inc., which gave negative results for IgM and IgG., CONCLUSION: An infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a more severe disease in patients with comorbidities and cancer; however, this case patient had a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this case report is to share the information on the clinical course and outcomes of a patient with malignancy. Rapid spreading of information is crucial in the management of COVID-19.	false
0	Identification of therapeutic drugs against COVID-19 through computational investigation on drug repurposing and structural modification. Global prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent development of anti-viral regime. Compared with the development of new drugs, drug repurposing can significantly reduce the cost, time, and safety risks. Given the fact that coronavirus harnesses spike protein to invade host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), hence we see if any previous anti-virtual compounds can block spike-ACE2 interaction and inhibit the virus entry. The results of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that remdesivir exhibits better than expected anti-viral invasion potential against COVID-19 among the three types of compounds including remdesivir, tenofovir and lopinavir. In addition, a positive correlation between the surface area occupied by remdesivir and anti-viral invasion potential was also found. As such, the structure of remdesivir was modified by linking an N-benzyl substituted diamidine derivative to its hydroxyl group through an ester bond. It was found that this compound has a higher anti-viral invasion potential and greater specificity.	false
0	Guidelines for oral fluid-based surveillance of viral pathogens in swine. Recent decades have seen both rapid growth and extensive consolidation in swine production. As a collateral effect, these changes have exacerbated the circulation of viruses and challenged our ability to prevent, control, and/or eliminate impactful swine diseases. Recent pandemic events in human and animal health, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and African swine fever virus, highlight the fact that clinical observations are too slow and inaccurate to form the basis for effective health management decisions: systematic processes that provide timely, reliable data are required. Oral fluid-based surveillance reflects the adaptation of conventional testing methods to an alternative diagnostic specimen. The routine use of oral fluids in commercial farms for PRRSV and PCV2 surveillance was first proposed in 2008 as an efficient and practical improvement on individual pig sampling. Subsequent research expanded on this initial report to include the detection of >=23 swine viral pathogens and the implementation of oral fluid-based surveillance in large swine populations (> 12,000 pigs). Herein we compile the current information regarding oral fluid collection methods, testing, and surveillance applications in swine production.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Trauma center activity and surge response during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic - The Philadelphia story. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed all facets of healthcare delivery. Trauma centers serve as regional resource sites for high-acuity patients; so careful planning is required to maintain access to trauma care during an infectious pandemic. Guidance from the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) provides a general framework for the pandemic response, but these precepts must be contextualized to local and regional factors. The Level I trauma centers in Philadelphia collaborated to implement this guidance and to share insights throughout the early phase of the pandemic. For this report, we examined the volume, acuity, and mechanisms of presenting trauma patients and the number and acuity of COVID-19 admissions during the pandemic. We also assessed the geospatial relationship between firearm incidents and COVID-19 case density. Finally, we collated the collaborative measures taken to maintain trauma access and team safety and evaluated the effect of these measures. Over the first 6 weeks of the pandemic, trauma contacts totaled 1,058 patients across all centers representing a 20% decrease compared with the same time last year. However, the number of penetrating trauma cases increased with a significant correlation between shooting locations and high-density COVID areas. During this time, Philadelphia trauma centers admitted a total of 1,413 confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 23% required mechanical ventilation. Divert status was activated for only 1.6% of available hours, and five of six centers remained open to all trauma transfers over the entire study period. Thus, through deliberate efforts to adapt ACS-COT guidelines and share lessons learned, the Level I trauma centers in Philadelphia maintained trauma access while simultaneously responding to the high-acuity infectious pandemic. This approach can be employed by other metropolitan areas and trauma systems to assure readiness during a prolonged crisis with large volumes of high-acuity trauma and nontrauma patients.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Incidence of COVID-19 among returning travelers in quarantine facilities: A longitudinal study and lessons learned. Introduction: The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had resulted in an unpresented global pandemic. In the initial events, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia implemented mandatory quarantine of returning travelers in order to contain COVID-19 cases. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a longitudinal study of the arriving travelers to Quarantine facilities and the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. Result(s): During the study period, there was a total of 1928 returning travelers with 1273 (66%) males. The age range was 28 days-69 years. Of all the travelers, 23 (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the first swab, 14/1928 (0.7%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 0.63% and 0.92% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.57). The second swab was positive in 9 (0.5%) of the other 1914 who were initially negative with a positivity rate of 0.39% and 0.62% among males and females, respectively (P = 0.49). There was no statistical difference in the positivity rates between first and second swab (P = 0.4). Of all travelers, 40 (n = 26, 1.3%) were admitted from the quarantine facility to the hospital due to COVID-19 related positive results or development of symptoms such as fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms; and 14 (0.7%) were admitted due to non-COVID-19 related illness. Conclusion(s): This study showed the efforts put for facility quarantine and that such activity yielded a lower incidence of positive cases. There was a need to have a backup healthcare facility to accommodate those developing a medical need for evaluation and admission for non-COVID-19 related illnesses.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Longitudinal analysis of serology and neutralizing antibody levels in COVID19 convalescents. BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is crucial for diagnosis of prior infection and predicting future immunity., METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens., RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers., CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	"Comparison of admission chest computed tomography and lung ultrasound performance for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in populations with different disease prevalence. Purpose: Chest computed tomography (CT) is considered a reliable imaging tool for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis, while lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a potential alternative to characterize lung involvement. The aim of the study was to compare diagnostic performance of admission chest CT and LUS for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method(s): We included patients admitted to emergency department between February 21-March 6, 2020 (high prevalence group, HP) and between March 30-April 13, 2020 (moderate prevalence group, MP) undergoing LUS and chest CT within 12 h. Chest CT was considered positive in case of ""indeterminate""/""typical"" pattern for COVID-19 by RSNA classification system. At LUS, thickened pleural line with >= three B-lines at least in one zone of the 12 explored was considered positive. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC were calculated for CT and LUS against real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology as reference standard. Result(s): The study included 486 patients (males 61 %; median age, 70 years): 247 patients in HP (COVID-19 prevalence 94 %) and 239 patients in MP (COVID-19 prevalence 45 %). In HP and MP respectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90-95 %, 43-69 %, 96-72 %, 20-95 % for CT and 94-93 %, 7-31 %, 94-52 %, 7-83 % for LUS. CT demonstrated better performance than LUS in diagnosis of COVID-19, both in HP (AUC 0.75 vs 0.51; P < 0.001) and MP (AUC 0.85 vs 0.62; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Admission chest CT shows better performance than LUS for COVID-19 diagnosis, at varying disease prevalence. LUS is highly sensitive, but not specific for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V."	false
0	Double burden of covid-19 pandemic and military occupation: Mental health among a palestinian university community in the west bank. Background: The Covid-19 pandemic created major global health crises, with serious effects on all aspects of life. The pandemic reached the Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine in early March 2020, and lock-down immediately ensued. Objective(s): To assess the prevalence and predictors of distress and insecurity among Birzeit University's community during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Method(s): An online survey completed in March-April 2020 using standardized and previously validated distress and insecurity scales. The survey was placed on the University portal accessed by students, faculty and employees, and was sent by email to faculty and employees. Data were weighted to reflect the University community's distribution. Finding(s): There were 1,851 participants in the study: 84% were undergraduate students, 10% graduate students, and 6% faculty and employees. Sixty two percent were women. Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 24 +/- 9.7). Prevalence of moderate/high distress and insecurity were 40% and 48% respec-tively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women, those under 35 years old and those with worse reported income, had significantly higher odds of distress and insecurity compared to their counterparts. Undergraduate students or living with a person at home with high risk of illness with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of distress compared to their counterparts (OR = 1.56, 95%CI[1.13-2.15]) and (OR = 1.34, 95%CI[1.11-1.62]) respectively. A COVID-19 worry score was significantly associated with higher odds of distress and insecurity (OR = 1.77, 95%CI[1.46-2.14]) and (OR = 4.3, 95%CI[3.53-5.23]) respectively. Conclusion(s): This study emphasizes the need to pay attention not only to physical health but also to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among young people, women, those with lower economic status, and those living with high risk persons during the pandemic. We hope that this study will inform the policies and interventions of the Palestinian Authority, local non-governmental organization, international groups working in the occupied Palestinian territory, and beyond.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	"Skin manifestations in COVID-19: Prevalence and relationship with disease severity. Background: Data on the clinical patterns and histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 related skin lesions, as well as on their relationship with the severity of COVID-19 are limited. Methods and Materials: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from 1 April to 1 May 2020. Clinical, microbiological and therapeutic characteristics, clinicopathological patterns of skin lesions, and direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical findings in skin biopsies were analyzed. Result(s): Fifty-eight out of the 2761 patients (2.1%) either consulting to the emergency room or admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 suspicion during the study period presented COVID-19 related skin lesions. Cutaneous lesions could be categorized into six patterns represented by the acronym ""GROUCH"": Generalized maculo-papular (20.7%), Grover's disease and other papulo-vesicular eruptions (13.8%), livedo Reticularis (6.9%), Other eruptions (22.4%), Urticarial (6.9%), and CHilblain-like (29.3%). Skin biopsies were performed in 72.4%, including direct immunofluorescence in 71.4% and immunohistochemistry in 28.6%. Patients with chilblain-like lesions exhibited a characteristic histology and were significantly younger and presented lower rates of systemic symptoms, radiological lung infiltrates and analytical abnormalities, and hospital and ICU admission compared to the rest of patients. Conclusion(s): Cutaneous lesions in patients with COVID-19 appear to be relatively rare and varied. Patients with chilblain-like lesions have a characteristic clinicopathological pattern and a less severe presentation of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Genetic variations among SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in China. The rapid spread of COVID-19, which has led to a global pandemic, has placed public health systems under severe pressure. Identifying variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains from different regions is a key factor for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms, aid in diagnosis, prevention and therapy of this disease. The present study is an analytical descriptive study aimed to determine genetic variations among SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in China. Sixty six complete genome sequences of the virus were retrieved from NCBI, the sequence of original Wuhan strain accession number NC 045512 was used as the reference sequence. Each genome sequence was blasted against the original Wuhan strain; the analysis was done using NCBI Nucleo-blast. The collected sequences showed 10 different variants. One hundred and thirty four mutations were identified among the variants of SARS-CoV-2 in this study; most of them 52.2% (70/134) were missense point mutation, majority of the mutations 65.7% (88/134) occurred in the open reading frame a/b (ORFab), few mutations occurred in the structural viral genome, each of spike (S) gene and nucleocapsid (N) gene showed 4 mutations; 2 silent point mutations and 2 missense point mutations occurred in each gene whereas membrane (M) gene showed silent point mutation and no mutation observed in the envelope E gene. The remarkable observation in this study showed by Yunnan variant accession number MT226610 which exhibited high incidence of mutations, it displayed 28 different point mutations; only 3(10.7%) of them were silent mutations while the rest were missense mutations. Our analysis showed several mutations including spike S gene and membrane M gene which may be responsible for a change in the structures of target proteins.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Performance of serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG detection in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the rapid diagnostic value of serum novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) IgM/IgG detection in COVID-19, aiming to further improve the diagnostic and screening system of COVID-19. Method(s): Blood samples were collected from 32 patients with COVID-19 (tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by RT-PCR and presented with clinical symptoms) and 34 non-COVID-19 patients (tested negative for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by RT-PCR and clinically confirmed as non-COVID-19 patients). Colloidal gold-based immunochromatography was used for rapid detection of 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG in these samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the test, and the correlation of serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG with disease course were analyzed. Result(s): Among the 32 COVID-19 patients, nine tested positive for 2019-nCoV IgM with a positive rate of 28.1% (9/32) and 25 positive for 2019-nCoV IgG with a positive rate of 78.1% (25/32). The total positive rate was 84.4% (27/32). Two of the 34 non-COVID-19 patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV IgG with a positive rate of 5.9% (2/34), while none of them was positive for 2019-nCoV IgM. The positive rates of serum IgM were 42.9% (3/7), 30.8% (4/13) and 16.7% (2/12) at 10-20 d, 21-30 d and 31-40 d after the patients developed the symptoms of COVID-19, respectively, which showed a decreasing tread with prolonged disease course. The positive rates of serum IgG in COVID-19 patients were 57.1% (4/7), 84.6% (11/13) and 83.3% (10/12) at 10-20 d, 21-30 d and 30-40 d after symptom onset. The rate showed an increasing trend with prolonged disease course and reached the peak in about 21-30 d. Conclusion(s): Serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG detection (using colloidal gold method) had high sensitivity (84.4%) and strong specificity (94.1%) in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. It had a great value in the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19 and could be used as a valuable complementary method to the COVID-19 diagnostic system due to its advantages of flexibility, rapidity and simplicity.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	COVID-19 disparity among racial and ethnic minorities in the US: A cross sectional analysis. AIM: To analyze racial disparities in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the United States of America and discuss possible reasons behind this inequality., SUBJECT AND METHODS: We obtained estimated case counts of African-American, Caucasian, Native American, Asian and Hispanic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)infection through May 5, 2020, from publicly available data on state departments of health websites. We calculated race-specific fractions as the percentage of the total population and analyzed the reasons behind this disparity., RESULTS: The incident rates of COVID-19 were higher among African Americans and among Latinos disproportionately higher than their representation in 14 states and 9 states, respectively. A similar observation was also reported for New York city. The percentage of deaths reported among African Americans was disproportionately higher than their represented share in the population in 23 out of 35 states. It was reported that 22.4% of COVID-19 deaths in the USA were African American, even though black people make up 13.4% of the USA population., CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows the disparity of coronavirus disease outcomes by ethnicity and race. Additional research is needed to determine the factors behind this inequality. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Anxiety and coping strategies among nursing students during the covid-19 pandemic. Anxiety is highly prevalent among nursing students even in normal circumstances. In Israel during the covid-19 pandemic and mandatory lockdown, nursing students encountered a new reality of economic uncertainty, fear of infection, challenges of distance education, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) at work etc. The objective of this study was to assess levels of anxiety and ways of coping among nursing students in the Ashkelon Academic College, Southern District, Israel. A cross-sectional study was conducted among all 244 students in the nursing department during the third week of a national lockdown. Anxiety level was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale with a cut-off point of 10 for moderate and of 15 for severe anxiety. Factor analysis was used to identify coping components. The prevalence of moderate and severe anxiety was 42.8% and 13.1% respectively. Gender, lack of PPE, and fear of infection were significantly associated with a higher anxiety score. Stronger resilience and usage of humor were associated with significantly lower anxiety levels, while mental disengagement with higher anxiety levels. The nursing department's staff may contribute in lowering student anxiety by maintaining a stable educational framework, providing high quality distant teaching and encouraging and supporting students through this challenging period.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	COVID-19 Outbreak in a Hemodialysis Center: A Retrospective Monocentric Case Series. Background: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to patients treated with kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Moreover, the impact of the disease on hemodialysis centers, the patients, and the health care workers is still not completely understood. Objective(s): We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design(s): A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting(s): A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patient(s): A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients' characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Method(s): Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and chi2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Result(s): Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P =.4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P =.3). Advanced age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were all found to be significantly related to death. Of the 18 infected health care professionals, 13 (72%) were symptomatic and 2 (11%) were hospitalized. There was no reported death among the health care workers. Limitation(s): Limited follow-up time compared with the course of the disease along with a small sample size. Conclusion(s): Patients treated with KRT show a high mortality rate secondary to COVID-19. CVD and age are shown to impact survival. Proactive measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the virus in such facilities. Trial Registration: Not applicable as this is a retrospective study.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	Liver and Kidney Transplant During a 6-Month Period in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Center Experience. Objectives: With the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, many studies have indicated that elective surgeries should be postponed. However, post-ponement of transplants may cause diseases to get worse and increase the number in wait lists. We believe that, with precautions, transplant does not pose a risk during pandemic. Here, we aimed to evaluate our transplant results, which we safely performed during a 6-month pandemic period. Materials and Methods: Until September 2020, 3140 kidney and 667 liver transplants have been performed in our centers. We evaluated 38 kidney transplants and 9 liver transplants procedures performed during the pandemic (March 1 to September 2, 2020). Recipient and donor candidates were screened for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction and thoracic computed tomography. All recipients had routine immunosuppressive protocol. During hospitalization at our COVID-19-free transplant facility, we restricted the interactions during multidisciplinary rounds. Results: During the pandemic, 38 kidney transplants with an average length of hospital stay of 8.1 days were performed. Mean serum creatinine values of recipients were 0.91, 0.86, and 0.74 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. During the pandemic, 9 living donor liver transplants (1 adult, 8 pediatric) were performed with an average length of hospital stay of 17.1 days. Mean serum total bilirubin levels were 0.9, 0.5, and 0.4 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. Mean serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were 38.1, 28.3, and 22.3 U/L on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. All recipients and donors were successfully discharged. Only 1 liver recipient died (on day 55 after discharge as a result of oxalosis-induced heart failure). Conclusions: According to our results, when precautions are taken, transplant does not pose a risk to patients during the pandemic period. We attribute the safety and success shown to our newly developed protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Happy hypoxia in critical COVID-19 patient: A case report in Tangerang, Indonesia. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern with increasing cases globally, including in Indonesia. COVID-19 clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, acute respiratory illness, respiratory failure that necessitate mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit (ICU), to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Some patients might present with happy hypoxia, a condition where patients have low oxygen saturations (SpO2 < 90%), but are not in significant respiratory distress and often appear clinically well, which is confusing for the doctors and treatment strategies. Most infections are mild in nature and have a relatively low case fatality rate (CFR); however, critical COVID-19 patients who need support in ICU have high CFR. We would like to report a case of happy hypoxia in a critical COVID-19-positive ICU hospitalized patient who survived from Indonesia. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Novel COVID-19 global outbreak and a need for proactive dental care. The global pandemic Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, has affected the countries worldwide and has been declared as a public health emergency by World Health Organisation. Because of the exclusive features of dental healthcare set-ups, risk of cross-contamination is greater between patients and dental personnel due to high chances of getting in contact with suspected or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Preventive measures are essential to be taken for prevention of furthermore spread of nosocomial infection. The present article provides a brief overview on COVID-19 in dental settings and recommended protocols for screening/assessment, patient management and precautions for dental health care professionals.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

0	Newly identified limitations of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and consequences. COVID-19 caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas RT-PCR based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised. This article is protected by copyright.

0	A needle in the haystack? Assessing the significance of envelope (E) gene-negative, nucleocapsid (N2) gene-positive SARS-CoV-2 detection by the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-COV-2 assay. The clinical significance of high crossing threshold (Ct) detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR is inadequately defined. In the course of universal admission screening with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay at our institution, we observed that 3.9 % (44/1123) of SARS-CoV-2 positive results were negative for the envelope (E) gene target but positive for the nucleocapsid (N2) target. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate during the three-month study period was 15.4 % (1123/7285), spanning April-June 2020. The majority of patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were asymptomatic, with 29.5 % of patients symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of presentation. Asymptomatic patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were significantly younger than symptomatic patients with the same results (average 37.6 vs. 58.4, p = 0.003). Similar proportions of prior SARS-CoV-2 positivity were noted among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (38.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.82). Among the 16 asymptomatic patients with radiographic imaging performed, four (25 %) had chest radiographic findings concerning for viral pneumonia. Interestingly, we observed an E-negative, N2-positive result in one patient with a previous SARS-CoV-2 by the Xpert Xpress that occurred 71 days prior. Critically, E-negative, N2-positive results were observed in 8 symptomatic patients with a new diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, though concerns remain about extended SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in some patients, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect patients with high Ct values (including E-negative, N2-positive results) is vital for retaining maximal sensitivity for diagnostic purposes. Our data show that a finding of E-positive, N2-negative SARS-CoV-2 should not be used to rule out the presence of subclinical infection. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Chicken Egg Yolk Antibodies (IgYs) block the binding of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants to human ACE2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is still spreading worldwide, and there is an urgent need to effectively prevent and control this pandemic. This study evaluated the potential efficacy of Egg Yolk Antibodies (IgY) as a neutralizing agent against the SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the neutralizing effect of anti-spike-S1 IgYs on the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as its inhibitory effect on the binding of the coronavirus spike protein mutants to human ACE2. Our results show that the anti-Spike-S1 IgYs showed significant neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, various spike protein mutants, and even SARS-CoV in vitro. It might be a feasible tool for the prevention and control of ongoing COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false

0	Preventing vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic: UK definitions of vitamin D sufficiency and recommended supplement dose are set too low. There is growing evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with risk of COVID-19. It is therefore distressing that there is major disagreement about the optimal serum level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and appropriate supplement dose. The UK Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has set the lowest level for defining sufficiency (10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L) of any national advisory body or scientific society and consequently recommends supplementation with 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day. We have searched for published evidence to support this but not found it. There is considerable evidence to support the higher level for sufficiency (20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and the American Institute of Medicine and hence greater supplementation (20 micrograms or 800 IU per day). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the UK typically fall by around 50% through winter. We believe that governments should urgently recommend supplementation with 20-25 micrograms (800-1,000 IU) per day.

0	Higher Sensitivity Provided by the Combination of Two Lateral Flow Immunoassay Tests for the Detection of COVID-19 Immunoglobulins. SARS-Cov-2 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic in March of 2020. COVID-19 has now been reported on every continent. In the United States, the total number of confirmed reported cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 1.8 million with the total death exceeding 100,000 people. The most common investigational diagnostics of this disease are RT-PCR and serology testing. The objective of this work was to validate two commercial kits for the detection of IgM and IgG using lateral flow immunoassay tests and to study the effect of the combination of both serology kits for better detection of immunoglobulins. A total of 195 patients presenting with respiratory symptoms suggestive of infection with SARS-Cov-2 were subject to serology and molecular testing. Two lateral flow immunochromatographic assay kits were used: the Healgen Scientific for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and the Raybiotech for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. Sensitivity and specificity of each kit alone and in combination were determined and compared. The limit of detection, inter and intra test variations, as well interfering substances and cross reactivity were also studied for both kits. The results show sensitivities for IgM detection varying between 58.9 and 66.2% for the kits alone and 87.7% of the combination of both kits. IgG detection was not significantly affected by this combination. Both kits manifested high specificities (99.2-100%). Both kits showed high clinical performance in terms of cross reactivity and interfering substances. Our results suggest using combinatory testing for the serology of COVID-19 after a full evaluation study, assessing all the parameters affecting their clinical performance before deciding on this combination.	false
0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospital wastewater from a low COVID-19 disease prevalence area. Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reported the detection of viral RNA in the stool of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. These clinical observations suggest that municipal and hospital wastewater from affected communities may contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Recent studies have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human feces. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given catchment population, as wastewater contains viruses from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The current study reports the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Slovenia. Two sizes of centrifugal filters were tested: 30kDa and 10 kDA AMICON R Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters, where 10 kDA resulted in a higher concentration factor and higher recovery efficiency. The results in hospital wastewater show that WBE can be used for monitoring COVID -19 and could be applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants as a potential complementary tool for public health monitoring at population level.

0	"SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality in racial/ethnic minority populations: A window into the stress related inflammatory basis of health disparities?. Health disparity related to race/ethnicity has been cited as ""the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time""(Peterson et al., 2018). A portion of the now recognized disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities is attributable to social determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES), physical living situation, health care access, and the psychosocial factors associated with socioenvironmental circumstances such as bias, victimization, trauma and toxic stress as well as structural factors that reduce the capacity to practice physical distancing (Agurs-Collins et al., 2019). In this paper, we hypothesize that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionate socio-economic and environmental stressors in the BIPOC population promoted heightened stress-associated neurobiological activity (Stress-NbA). This chronic elevation in Stress-NbA results in down-stream complications of chronic stress including underactivation of anti-viral type I IFN pathway genes. This results in an increase in susceptibility to viral diseases, including coronavirus illnesses. Additionally, Stress-NbA chronically potentiates systemic inflammation (from hematopoietic system activation with myelopoiesis) increasing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and setting the stage for stress-related chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This process was propelled by overactivation of immune cell gene expression in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation pathway and underactivation of gene expression in the anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) pathway. The higher prevalence of MetS and NCDs in minority populations turned out to be predictive of the elevated risk they would face in the presence of a highly contagious viral pandemic. The stress-related generation of a chronic non-pathogen associated molecular pattern (non-PAMP) immunoactivation state led to decreased viral immune defense and increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased risk of severe illness induced by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS).Copyright © 2020 The Authors"	false

The discussion around those with drug use disorders in the midst of the pandemic has focused on the need to ensure uninterrupted treatment access; however, very few in this population actually receive treatment, and retention is a substantial issue among those who do. Evidence from other chronic conditions suggests persons at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications are foregoing care due to fear of contracting the virus. Persons with drug use disorders tend to fall into this high-risk category, and thus may be avoiding healthcare facilities. Our data suggest this is true. If so, adverse outcomes, and increased severity of use disorders and associated health complications, could become prevalent. Clinicians should identify persons with drug use disorders who may be foregoing treatment, and engage them using methods that minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

0	MASSIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY DEPARTMENTS AND DOCTORS IN SPAIN. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Significant human and material resources have been diverted to COVID-19. Healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments and specialists in Spain., METHODS: Nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures and physicians of Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service., RESULTS: Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of Gastroenterology and Hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancellation of elective liver transplant and TIPS. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in >80% hospitals but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing., CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of Gastroenterology-related complications is expected due to resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection and quick reorganization of healthcare resources are still needed. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

0	Point mutation bias in SARS-CoV-2 variants results in increased ability to stimulate inflammatory responses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces severe pneumonia and is the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have RNA proofreading enzymes in their genomes, resulting in fewer gene mutations than other RNA viruses. Nevertheless, variants of SARS-CoV-2 exist and may induce different symptoms; however, the factors and the impacts of these mutations are not well understood. We found that there is a bias to the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 variants, with disproportionate mutation to uracil (U). These point mutations to U are mainly derived from cytosine (C), which is consistent with the substrate specificity of host RNA editing enzymes, APOBECs. We also found the point mutations which are consistent with other RNA editing enzymes, ADARs. For the C-to-U mutations, the context of the upstream uracil and downstream guanine from mutated position was found to be most prevalent. Further, the degree of increase of U in SARS-CoV-2 variants correlates with enhanced production of cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, in cell lines when compared with stimulation by the ssRNA sequence of the isolated virus in Wuhan. Therefore, RNA editing is a factor for mutation bias in SARS-CoV-2 variants, which affects host inflammatory cytokines production.	false
0	Successful treatment of acute heart failure in COVID-19-induced cytokine storm with tocilizumab: a case report. Background: SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce a cytokine storm, a hyperinflammatory state driven by up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and immunomodulatory chemokines that may result in acute heart failure., Case summary: A 65-year-old woman with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 developed shock with multiorgan system failure, including acute biventricular heart failure, 2 weeks after the initial onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient experienced myocardial recovery within 48 h after administration of tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, and multiple supportive vasoactive medications., Discussion: The differential diagnosis of acute heart failure in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection is broad, including sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, viral lymphocytic myocarditis, and acute coronary syndrome. Immunomodulatory treatment with tocilizumab may benefit patients who develop cardiogenic shock associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	The Association of Inflammatory Cytokines in the Pulmonary Pathophysiology of Respiratory Failure in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. Objectives: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 mortality and morbidity is attributable to respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The pathogenesis underpinning coronavirus disease 2019-induced respiratory failure may be attributable to a dysregulated host immune response. Our objective was to investigate the pathophysiological relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and respiratory failure in severe coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Multicenter prospective observational study., Setting: ICU., Patients: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and noncoronavirus disease 2019 critically ill patients with respiratory failure (ICU control group)., Interventions: Daily measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines., Measurements and Main Results: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collected daily. Daily serum samples were drawn for measurements of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Pulmonary outcomes were the ratio of Pao2/Fio2 and static lung compliance. Twenty-six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and 22 ICU controls were enrolled. Of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 58% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 62% required mechanical ventilation, 12% underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 23% died. A negative correlation between interleukin-6 and Pao2/Fio2 (rho, -0.531; p = 0.0052) and static lung compliance (rho, -0.579; p = 0.033) was found selectively in the coronavirus disease 2019 group. Diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with significantly elevated serum interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta on the day of diagnosis., Conclusions: The inverse relationship between serum interleukin-6 and Pao2/Fio2 and static lung compliance is specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Similar observations were not found with interleukin-beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Novel coronavirus infection and acute kidney injury in two renal transplant recipients: a case report. BACKGROUND: The causative virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may cause severe fatal pneumonia. The clinical presentation includes asymptomatic infection, severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. Data pertaining to acute renal injury due to COVID-19 in patients who have undergone renal transplantation are scarce. We herein report two cases of COVID-19 along with acute kidney injury following kidney transplantation. Case presentation: Two patients with COVID-19 underwent renal transplantation and were subsequently diagnosed with acute kidney injury. The first patient presented with progressive respiratory symptoms and acute renal injury. He was treated with diuretics and suspension of immunosuppressive therapy; however, the patient died. The second patient presented with respiratory tract symptoms, hypoxemia, and progressive deterioration of renal function followed by improvement. Her mycophenolate mofetil was stopped after admission, and tacrolimus was discontinued 10 days later. Moxifloxacin and methylprednisolone were continued in combination with albumin and gamma globulin infusion. A diuretic was administered, and prednisone was gradually reduced along with tacrolimus. The patient exhibited a satisfactory clinical recovery., CONCLUSION: Patients who develop COVID-19 after kidney transplantation are at risk of acute kidney injury, and their prednisone, immunosuppressant, and gamma globulin treatment must be adjusted according to their condition.	false

0	Clinical characteristics of inpatients with Coronavirus disease 2019 and acute ischemic stroke: from epidemiology to outcomes. Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) is currently the most frequently reported neurological complication of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article will elaborate on the clinical features of inpatients with COVID-19 and AIS and the pathophysiological mechanism of AIS under the background of COVID-19. Through a detailed search of relevant studies, we found that the incidence of AIS among COVID-19 patients varied from 0.9% to 4.6%, and AIS has been observed in many people without underlying diseases and cardiovascular risk factors as well as young people. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of COVID-19 patients with AIS was higher than historical AIS patients, and the proportion of large vessel occlusion (LVO) was about 64.2%. COVID-19 patients with AIS have commonly high levels of D-D dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. The pooled mortality of COVID-19 patients with AIS was 38% and the mortality of LVO patients is higher (45.9%). Compared with COVID-19-negative AIS patients in the same period in 2020 and 2019, COVID- 19 patients with AIS had a worse prognosis.

Asthma is a prevalent pediatric disease causing important health, economic, and emotional burdens around the world. Asthma attacks can be controlled with standardized management, but no cure exists for the disease. Many attacks are triggered by respiratory tract infections and children with basic airway diseases are at high risk for developing severe or critical illnesses. The new COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt children's asthma control management and we have set out to summarize the main factors that need to be considered by pediatricians treating children with asthma at times like these. We discuss the intrinsic nature of asthma and its treatment, and the effects of irregular treatment giving recommendations such as the use of the WeChat platform and WeChat Official Accounts for follow-ups to improve children's asthma compliance during the pandemic. We also cover the COVID-19 protection strategies, and the importance of stress reduction, a balanced diet, exercise, and the avoidance of known attack triggers for maintaining good control of asthma during the pandemic.

0	Toward to establish selection criteria for rapid serological tests for COVID-19. COVID-19, the new pandemic is associated to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Social distancing and the testing have been the principal measures that have shown to be effective for the reduction of critical cases. Although the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is the RT-PCR, rapid serological tests could also be used for prevalence studies, and for epidemiological monitoring. In order to characterize the humoral immune response, we analyzed eight immuno-chromatographic test and one ELISA test, as a verification or secondary validation analysis used positive and negative control serum samples. Sera from negative and positive individuals [asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals, outpatient or inpatientor (intensive care unit)] were analyzed, and the following results were found: of all these rapid tests, only 4 exhibit clear banding patterns for IgG and two of these also showed results for IgM (only in a few symptomatic patients). Instead, with an ELISA test a preferential recognition was observed for symptomatic patients who were critically ill, whereas in asymptomatic individuals it did not show more than 25% of positivity. Understanding and validating molecular and serological tests are an essential component for the design of public health measures to response to the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 PeerJ Inc..

0	Antiviral functional foods and exercise lifestyle prevention of coronavirus. Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing global mortality and lockdown burdens. A compromised immune system is a known risk factor for all viral influenza infections. Functional foods optimize the immune system capacity to prevent and control pathogenic viral infections, while physical activity augments such protective benefits. Exercise enhances innate and adaptive immune systems through acute, transient, and long-term adaptations to physical activity in a dose-response relationship. Functional foods prevention of non-communicable disease can be translated into protecting against respiratory viral infections and COVID-19. Functional foods and nutraceuticals within popular diets contain immune-boosting nutraceuticals, polyphenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, unsaturated fatty-acids, micronutrient vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate, and trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper. Foods with antiviral properties include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods and probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, peptides, and cyclotides. Regular moderate exercise may contribute to reduce viral risk and enhance sleep quality during quarantine, in combination with appropriate dietary habits and functional foods. Lifestyle and appropriate nutrition with functional compounds may offer further antiviral approaches for public health.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of penn class 3 and 4 cytokine release syndrome complicating COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure. This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients., METHODS: Five single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period. In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients., RESULTS: Non-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE. The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFalpha, IFNgamma and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. All patients demonstrated significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFalpha., CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with Penn class 3 and 4 CRS complicating COVID-19, TPE demonstrated a prompt improvement in oxygenation and reduction in cytokine load without compromising patient safety. As this pilot study was envisioned to be hypothesis generating, expanded trials using TPE alone and in conjunction with novel pharmacologic agents are warranted., REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04374149.

0	Sustainable and fast saliva-based COVID-19 virus diagnosis kit using a novel GO-decorated Au/FBG sensor. Monitoring the COVID-19 virus through patients' saliva is a favorable non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and infection control. In this study, salivary samples of COVID-19 patients collected from 6 patients with the median age of 58.5 years, ranging from 34 to 72 years (2 females and 4 males) were analyzed using an Au/fiber Bragg grating (FBG) probe decorated with GO. The probe measures the prevalence of positivity in saliva and the association between the virus density and changes to sensing elements. When the probe is immersed in patients' saliva, deviation of the detected light wavelength and intensity from healthy saliva indicate the presence of the virus and confirms infection. For a patient in the hyperinflammatory phase of desease, who has virus density of 1.2 x 108 copies/mL in saliva, the maximum wavelength shift and intensity changes after 1600 s were shown to be 1.12 nm and 2.01 dB, respectively. While for a patient in the early infection phase with 1.6 x 103 copies/mL, these values were 0.98 nm and 1.32 dB. The precise and highly sensitive FBG probe proposed in this study was found a reliable tool for quick detection of the COVID-19 virus within 10 s after exposure to patients' saliva in any stage of the disease.

0	Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales causing secondary infections during the COVID-19 crisis at a New York City hospital. BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for secondary bacterial infections with MDR pathogens, including carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)., OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene detection and phylogenetic analysis., RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K. pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3); one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by Illumina sequencing data., CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future impact.

0	Acute arterial occlusion of the lower limb as the main clinical manifestation in a patient with Covid-19 - Case Report. Introdution: COVID-19 infection may predispose to venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and disseminated intravascular coagulation; however, there are few reports of lower limb ischemia as the main manifestation of the disease., Presentation of Case: Male patient, 69 years old, asthmatic, ex-smoker and bearer of systemic arterial hypertension, has been admitted to the emergency department with sudden onset of pain in the right lower limb (RLL), associated with cyanosis and reduced temperature of the limb. He has been tested for COVID-19 in the OR with positive result for IGG and IGM. Computed tomography angiography (AngioCT) was performed, showing signs of arterial embolization to both limbs, right internal iliac artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Faced with the threat of limb loss and the absence of signs and symptoms of visceral ischemia, the patient underwent full anticoagulation and RLL thromboembolectomy and tricompartmental fasciotomy. He was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization and demonstrated no other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, following outpatient follow-up., Discussion: COVID-19 is associated with high risk of thrombotic complications being related to the clinical severity of the patient, with few studies that show symptoms of sudden pain in the lower limb without other complaints., Conclusion: Individuals infected with COVID-19 are at risk for arterial thromboembolic events, and knowledge of such cases is essential in order to create specific protocols for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in these patients, in addition to increasing the suspicion of infection in individuals with acute arterial occlusion, mostly during pandemic times.

0	A case of a new CoVID-19 coronavirus infection in a patient being treated with programmatic hemodialysis. Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by a new strain of the virus of the genus coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with the aerosol-droplet and contact-household transmission mechanism; patogenetically local and systemic inflammatory process, hyperactive impulsive cascade, endotheliopathy, hypoxia, leading to the development of micro - and microthrombosis; it occurs from asymptomatic to clinically significant forms of intoxication, vascular lesions, lungs, heart, kidneys, and GI tract with risk of complications (ARF, ARDS, sepsis, shock, multiple organ dysfunction SYNDROME, pulmonary embolism). Currently, there are few data on the course of this disease in patients undergoing treatment with program hemodialysis, as well as methods of specific treatment of this group of patients. The article describes the case of the first patient in the Clinical Infectious Hospital named after S.P.

0	Comparative analysis of three laboratory based serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 in an Australian cohort. Many unanswered questions remain regarding the role of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in this unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. These include their utility for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, past infection or exposure, correlation with immunity and the effective duration of immunity. This study examined the performance of three laboratory based serological assays, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, MAGLUMI 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM/IgG and EDI Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG immunoassays. We evaluated 138 samples from a reference non-infected population and 71 samples from a cohort of 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. The samples were collected at various intervals of 0-45 days post symptoms onset (PSO). Specificity and sensitivity of these assays was 60.9%/71.4% (IgA) and 94.2%/63.3% (IgG) for EUROIMMUN; 98.5%/18.4% (IgM) and 97.8%/53.1% (IgG) for MAGLUMI; and 94.9%/22.5% (IgM) and 93.5%/57.1% (IgG) for EDI, respectively. When samples collected >=14 days PSO were considered, the sensitivities were 100.0 and 100.0%; 31.0 and 82.8%; 34.5 and 57.1%, respectively. Using estimated population prevalence of 0.1, 1, and 10%, the positive predictive value of all assays remained low. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA lacked specificity for acute diagnosis and all IgM assays offered poor diagnostic utility. Seroconversion can be delayed although all patients had seroconverted at 28 days in our cohort with the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Despite this, with specificity of only 94% this assay would not be satisfactory for seroprevalence studies in the general Australian population given this is likely to be currently <1%.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia	false

0	Antibody Response to a Nucleocapsid Epitope as a Marker for COVID-19 Disease Severity. Characterization of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to predict COVID-19 disease trajectories. Ineffective antibodies or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) could derail patients' immune responses, for example. ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis epitope-mapped plasma from 86 COVID-19 patients. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including ICU stay, requirement for ventilators, and death. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate both with various comorbidities and ADE hallmarks, including increased IL-6 levels and early IgG response. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within five days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 diagnostic for the early prediction of disease severity to guide more effective therapeutic interventions., One Sentence Summary: Antibodies targeting a specific location within a SARS-CoV-2 structural protein are linked to poor COVID-19 disease outcomes.	false

0	Outpatient Ultrafiltration to Prevent Hospital Readmission During Covid 19 Pandemic in Diuretic Intolerant Patient: Case Study. Introduction: Heart Failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults greater than 65 years of age in the U.S. and results in over 1,000,000 hospitalizations annually. Despite advances in medical therapeutics, mortality remains high. Adjustments in workflow across hospital systems have been instituted to reduce HF hospitalizations. Ambulatory HF clinics have helped in this regard. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need to minimize utilization of hospital resources and limit patient hospital admissions is paramount. Inpatient ultrafiltration (UF) has been utilized to improve congestion in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Less is known of outpatient utilization of UF in the ambulatory HF patient. We present a case of outpatient UF to reduce congestion in an ambulatory HF patient to minimize hospitalization in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. Case: A 70-year-old female with HF preserved ejection fraction, combined pre and post pulmonary capillary hypertension, with chronic dyspnea on continuous home oxygen, who presented to the HF clinic. The patient had previous multiple hospitalizations due to recurrent congestion, with therapies limited by dermatologic biopsy proven allergy to sulfa based diuretics. She had failed various diuretic regimens with recurrent desquamating whole body rash. She had recurrent weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and again was refractory to outpatient therapies. Given her co-morbidities, she was deemed high risk for COVID-19 exposure. A decision to proceed with outpatient UF was made. The day of outpatient HF clinic visit, we placed a brachial dual lumen 16-gauge extended length catheter. A heparin drip was initiated thirty minutes prior to the start of UF per protocol. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl and estimated GFR was 44. Initial outpatient session was performed over a total of 4-hours with isolated veno-venous UF utilizing the Aquadex Flex Flow system at a rate of 200 cc/hr fluid removal. The patient completed a total of 4 sessions, and total fluid removal was 4950mL. (Table 1) The patient had immediate improvement in symptoms. Discussion(s): UF is a method of decongestion that can be used as an alternative to loop diuretics. Simplified UF devices can utilize peripheral venous access, low blood flows, and small extracorporeal blood volume. Previous experience with intermittent outpatient UF utilizing peritoneal dialysis and hemofiltration has been reported, though not widely utilized. This is the first case to report the use of the Aquadex Flex Flow system to provide outpatient UF therapies in the COVID-19 era. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing cardiac and pulmonary disease, including congestive HF, increase risk of serious complications from exposure to SARS-COVID-2 virus. We report a novel case of minimizing exposure risk of a congested HF patient using outpatient isolated veno-venous UF in the ambulatory setting.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Immunity, endothelial injury and complement-induced coagulopathy in COVID-19. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China. This pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a pathogenic condition that has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached pandemic proportions. As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases. In the early stages of the disease, most patients experience mild clinical symptoms, including a high fever and dry cough. However, 20% of patients rapidly progress to severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Almost 10% of these critically ill patients subsequently die. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression are emerging and highlight the critical role of the immunological hyper-response - characterized by widespread endothelial damage, complement-induced blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy - in disease exacerbation. These insights may aid the identification of new or existing therapeutic interventions to limit the progression of early disease and treat severe cases.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.	false
0	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a patient with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab: a case report. Background: The understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, other manifestations, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, and immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, have been described. We present a case of a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab with a marked biochemical improvement. Case presentation: In this case report we present a Caucasian patient with COVID-19 who developed a marked elevation of inflammatory parameters with ferritin 36,023 mug/L, but also elevated C-reactive protein 334 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L, 1 week after admission to the intensive care unit. He met five of eight criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but he lacked the high fever and cytopenia seen in the majority of cases. He was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, and over the next days, a rapid decrease in ferritin and C-reactive protein levels was observed. However, his respiratory failure only improved gradually, and he was weaned off the respirator 11 days later. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 may induce a hyperinflammatory clinical picture and in some cases develop into hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In our patient's case, therapeutic interleukin-6 blockade abrogated signs of hyperinflammation but did not seem to improve pulmonary function. Measurement of ferritin and C-reactive protein, as well as quantification of interleukin-6 on indication, should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19. Specific treatment in such patients must also be contemplated, preferably in randomized controlled trials.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false

0	Lupus anticoagulant and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a procoagulant state that can lead to fatal thromboembolic events. Several studies have documented a high prevalence of lupus anticoagulant that may at least partially explain the procoagulant profile of COVID-19. However, the association between lupus anticoagulant and thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is controversial and no study has specifically evaluated the impact of lupus anticoagulant on mortality. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between lupus anticoagulant and mortality in a large group of 192 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Lupus anticoagulant was found in 95 patients (49.5%). No difference in the percentage of patients with lupus anticoagulant was observed between 130 survivors and 62 non-survivors (47.7 versus 53,2%; p = 0.4745). When the combined outcome of death or need for mechanical ventilation in survivors was taken into account, the difference in the prevalence of patients with lupus anticoagulant between the patients with the combined outcome (n = 76) and survivors who did not require mechanical ventilation (n = 116) was not significant (52.6% versus 47.4%; p = 0.4806). In multivariate analysis predictors of mortality or need for mechanical ventilation in survivors were obesity, low oxygen saturation and elevated troponin levels measured on admission. In conclusion, our study did not show any association of lupus anticoagulant with mortality and with need for mechanical ventilation in survivors. The role of obesity, low SaO2 and elevated troponin levels as predictors of a worse prognosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was confirmed.	false

0	An Outbreak of Covid-19 on an Aircraft Carrier. BACKGROUND: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurred on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a crew of 4779 personnel., METHODS: We obtained clinical and demographic data for all crew members, including results of testing by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms., RESULTS: The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and 1 died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms.

0	Unexpected Ground-Glass Opacities on Abdominopelvic CT of a Patient With a Negative SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test Result and No Respiratory Symptoms Upon Admission. One of the biggest challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be the detection of asymptomatic and presymptomatic persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 may transmit the virus to others and may have subclinical lung abnormalities. Some hospitals use SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests for pre-admission screening testing because they are relatively inexpensive, have a rapid turnaround time, and can be performed at the point of care; however, antigen tests are generally less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification tests with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Moreover, as the local COVID-19 prevalence increases, the negative predictive value of antigen tests may decrease, meaning that the probability of having false-negative results may increase. We present a case of a patient who, prior to admission for a surgical procedure, had a negative antigen test result for SARS-CoV-2, had no respiratory symptoms, and had no suspected or known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after admission. The only factor that led the healthcare team to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection was an unexpected finding of bilateral ground-glass opacities on an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), which was performed to assess the extent of a perianal abscess the patient presented. This case highlights the importance of using highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2 tests for pre-admission screening testing in the hospital setting. Copyright © 2020, Soler-Luna et al.	false
0	Mutation profile of over 4500 SARS-CoV-2 isolations reveals prevalent cytosine-to-uridine deamination on viral RNAs. Aim: The inference of coronavirus evolution is largely based on mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. Misinterpretation of these mutations would mislead people about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Materials & methods: With 4521 lines of SARS-CoV-2, we obtained 3169 unique point mutation sites. We counted the numbers and calculated the minor allele frequency (MAF) of each mutation type. Results: Nearly half of the point mutations are C-T mismatches and 20% are A-G mismatches. The MAF of C-T and A-G mismatches is significantly higher than MAF of other mutation types. Conclusion:  The excessive C-T mismatches do not resemble the random mutation profile. They are likely to be caused by the cytosine-to-uridine deamination system in hosts.	false
0	Variety of radiological findings in a family with COVID-19: a case report. Introduction: In December 2019, a case series of pneumonia associated with seafood and wet animal market was reported as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The COVID-19 less frequently affects the pediatric group, and asymptomatic children are commonly reported. This feature is important due to the potential transmissibility of COVID-19 through these cases. There is a variety of atypical clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations among children infected with COVID-19. Case presentation: We report two sisters with COVID-19 pneumonia who had close contact with their 77-year-old grandmother. Their grandmother expired with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The older sister (15 years old) firstly presented with severe cough, fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed atypical lobar pneumonic infiltration only in the left lower lobe. The younger sister (6 years old) was affected the following day with milder symptoms (i.e., fever and cough). Her chest CT scan demonstrated typical mild generalized patchy ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening scattered in both lungs. The CT presentation of their grandmother showed typical bilateral white lungs with crazy paving appearance. The standard regimen for both sisters was administrated, and the patients' respiratory conditions improved after 5 days of treatment. Both cases were discharged with good general conditions. Conclusion(s): Children are considered potentially important causes of COVID-19 transmission. The symptoms in children are milder, and clinicians should be aware of taking a definite history of infected family members. Atypical clinical symptoms and imaging features are more common in children than adults; therefore, it is necessary to identify the typical and atypical imaging patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pediatric population.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Pneumatosis Intestinalis in COVID-19: Case Series. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed pneumatosis intestinalis (PI)., METHODS: This case series was conducted in intensive care units at two large tertiary care centers within the Northwell Health System, located in New York State. Patients were included if they were identified as having confirmed COVID-19 as well as pneumatosis intestinalis from March 16, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, vasopressor use, anticoagulation use, opiate use, paralytic use, COVID-19 treatment regimen, serum lactate, arterial pH, serum bicarbonate, subsequent intervention, and outcomes during hospitalization were collected. Results: A total of nine patients were identified. Average serum lactate was 4.33 mmol/L at time of diagnosis. Portal venous gas (56%) and bowel dilation (56%) were common radiographic findings. Subsequent morbidity (increased vasopressor requirements - 67%, acute kidney injury - 67%, increased oxygen requirements - 44%) and mortality (78%) were high. PI occurred despite a majority of patients being on anticoagulation (78%). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors were commonly administered (56%) prior to development of PI., CONCLUSION: Pneumatosis intestinalis in COVID-19 is clinically significant, with high morbidity and mortality, and is also likely underdiagnosed.

0	Production and application of polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein. Development to rapid, highly sensitive diagnosis kit for early Corona viral detection among the population. Pathogenic novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a recently rising infection that causes a high death rate in contaminated individuals. Many of the individuals who are infected are unaware of the infection because they may be asymptomatic carriers of the virus.To early analyze the viral disease, we proposed advancement of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins-explicit polyclonal antibodies-based kit described in this specific circumstance. The tests, if made accessible from variety of makers, can help smooth out early immunodetection of the crown viral infection. The survey Safe and Patient Friendly Healthcare suggests early diagnosis as the key to patients recovering from this deadly ailment.	false
0	Sex differences in self-report anxiety and sleep quality during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and home isolation has impacted quality of life, but the perceived impact on anxiety and sleep remains equivocal. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders on self-report anxiety and sleep quality, with a focus on sex differences. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased anxiety and decreased sleep quality, with stronger associations in women. METHOD(S): One hundred three participants (61 female, 38 +/- 1years) reported perceived changes in anxiety and sleep quality due to stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Chi-square and T test analyses were utilized to assess sex differences in reported anxiety and sleep. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the associations between reported impact of COVID-19 and anxiety/sleep parameters. RESULT(S): Women (80.3%) reported higher prevalence of increased general anxiety due to COVID-19 when compared to men (50%; p = 0.001) and elevated STAI state anxiety compared to men (43 +/- 1 vs. 38 +/- 1a.u., p = 0.007). Despite these differences in anxiety, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on PSQI was not different between sexes. However, when stratified by perceived changes in anxiety due to COVID-19, participants with higher anxiety responses to COVID-19 had higher ISI compared to those with no perceived changes in anxiety (9 +/- 1 vs. 5 +/- 1a.u., p = 0.003). Additionally, participants who reported reduced sleep quality due to COVID-19 reported higher state anxiety (45 +/- 1a.u.) compared to those that perceived no change (36 +/- 2a.u., p = 0.002) or increased (36 +/- 2a.u., p < 0.001) sleep quality. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 and state-ordered home isolation was associated with higher anxiety and reduced sleep quality, with a stronger association in women with respect to anxiety.	false
0	COVID-19 Outbreak at an Overnight Summer School Retreat - Wisconsin, July-August 2020. During July 2-August 11, 2020, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred at a boys' overnight summer school retreat in Wisconsin. The retreat included 152 high school-aged boys, counselors, and staff members from 21 states and territories and two foreign countries. All attendees were required to provide documentation of either a positive serologic test result* within the past 3 months or a negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests result for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) <=7 days before travel, to self-quarantine within their households for 7 days before travel, and to wear masks during travel. On July 15, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) began an investigation after being notified that two students at the retreat had received positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. WDHS offered RT-PCR testing to attendees on July 28 and serologic testing on August 5 and 6. Seventy-eight (51%) attendees received positive RT-PCR results (confirmed cases), and 38 (25%) met clinical criteria for COVID-19 without a positive RT-PCR result (probable cases). By the end of the retreat, 118 (78%) persons had received a positive serologic test result. Among 24 attendees with a documented positive serologic test result before the retreat, all received negative RT-PCR results. After RT-PCR testing on July 28, WDHS recommended that remaining susceptible persons (asymptomatic and with negative RT-PCR test results) quarantine from other students and staff members at the retreat. Recommended end dates for isolation or quarantine were based on established guidance (1,2) and determined in coordination with CDC. All attendees were cleared for interstate and commercial air travel to return home on August 11. This outbreak investigation documented rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, likely from a single student, among adolescents and young adults in a congregate setting. Mitigation plans that include prearrival quarantine and testing, cohorting, symptom monitoring, early identification and isolation of cases, mask use, enhanced hygiene and disinfection practices, and maximal outdoor programming are necessary to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in these settings (3,4).	false
0	Unemployment in Switzerland in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic: an intertemporal perspective. The following contribution compares the unemployment situation arising from the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 pandemic with previous employment crises in Switzerland. In addition, it forecasts the future trajectory of unemployment based on ongoing changes in hazard rates. From a historical perspective, current unemployment as well as that expected by the federal authorities in the medium term do not seem that dramatic. Current hazard rates present a different picture, however, predicting increases in both the unemployment rate and long-term unemployment to record levels. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	Mental health of people in Australia in the first month of COVID-19 restrictions: a national survey. Objectives: To estimate the population prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety, thoughts of being better off dead, irritability, and high optimism about the future, and of direct experience of COVID-19, loss of employment caused by COVID-19 restrictions, worry about contracting COVID-19, or major disadvantage because of the restrictions; to examine the relationship between these experiences and reporting mental symptoms. Design, setting, participants: Anonymous online survey of adult Australian residents, 3 April - 2 May 2020. Main Outcome Measure(s): Self-reported psychological status during the preceding fortnight assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; symptoms of depression) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Optimism about the future was assessed with a 10-point study-specific visual analogue scale. Result(s): 13 829 respondents contributed complete response data. The estimated prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 >= 10) was 27.6% (95% CI, 26.1-29.1%) and of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 >= 10) 21.0% (95% CI, 19.6-22.4%); 14.6% of respondents (95% CI, 13.5-16.0%) reported thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm (PHQ-9, item 9) on at least some days and 59.2% (95% CI, 57.6-60.7%) that they were more irritable (GAD-7, item 6). An estimated 28.3% of respondents (95% CI, 27.1-29.6%) reported great optimism about the future (score >= 8). People who had lost jobs, were worried about contracting COVID-19, or for whom the restrictions had a highly adverse impact on daily life were more likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, and less likely to report high optimism than people without these experiences. Conclusion(s): Mental health problems were widespread among Australians during the first month of the stage two COVID-19 restrictions; in addition, about one-quarter of respondents reported mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. A public mental health response that includes universal, selective and indicated clinical interventions is needed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Individual Perceived Stress Mediates Psychological Distress in Medical Workers During COVID-19 Epidemic Outbreak in Wuhan. Background: Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, thousands of medical workers have been dispatched to support Wuhan against the virus. The purpose of this study was to identify the independent risk factors for psychological distress in order to develop a more effective strategy and precise evidence-based psychological intervention for medical workers., Methods: This multisite cross-sectional survey recruited doctors and nurses from local and nonlocal medical teams working at 16 hospitals in Wuhan to complete this online survey from February to March, 2020. Psychological status was evaluated through Perceived Stress Scales (PSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS)., Results: Of 966 participants, the prevalence of stress (95.9%), depression (46.0%) and anxiety (39.3%) were high. Local medical workers exhibited even higher scores of PSS, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ASDS than those from outside Hubei (P<0.001). Females had more severe perceived stress, depression and anxiety than males (P<0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed that perceived stress is associated with increased odds of depression (OR=1.413; 95% CI: 1.338-1.493; P<0.001) and anxiety (OR=1.515; 95% CI: 1.407-1.631; P<0.001)., Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated a high prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and acute distress among medical workers on the front-line during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. The level of psychological impact may be mediated by individual perceptions of stressful events. Copyright © 2020 Zhang et al.	false
0	Gender differences of depression and anxiety among social media users during the COVID-19 outbreak in China:a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the outbreak of infectious diseases would result in mental health problems. Females are in greater risk for psychological problems than males. The present study investigated gender differences of depression and anxiety and explored associated factors during the COVID-19 epidemic among Chinese social media users., METHODS: We recruited 3088 participants through social media cross China. Participants completed sociodemographic and the COVID-19 epidemic related questions, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2), the Chinese version of the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. We applied Chi-square test and ANOVA for data description and linear regression analysis for exploring factors associated with depression and anxiety., RESULTS: Of 3063 participants eligible for analysis, the total prevalence of depression and anxiety was 14.14 and 13.25%. Females were experiencing more severe stress and anxiety symptoms, while males showed better resilience to stress. The severity of depression symptoms would decrease with the increase of age resilience, and it would increase if being unemployed, feeling less adapted, being more stressed. The severity of anxiety symptoms would decrease with higher education and better resilience, and it would increase if being female, spending over 60 min on COVID-19 related information, less adapted, and being more stressed., CONCLUSION: The findings show the increased prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese population during the COVID-19 epidemic, and females are experiencing more severe anxiety symptoms than males. As social media is the current main resource of information related to COVID-19, interventions should be implemented to help users to limit the time they spend on social media and to get key information related to the epidemic from authoritative and authentic resource to avoid infodemic and prevent mental health problems.	false
0	Changes in Depression and Physical Activity Among College Students on a Diverse Campus After a COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Order. The numerous negative health impacts of COVID-19, which include expected changes to psychiatric illness and physical activity (PA), are disproportionately distributed in the United States. Mental illnesses and physical inactivity are prevalent among U.S. college students. This study examined whether there was a change in minutes of PA and depression scores after a stay-at-home order and examined predictors of these changes. An online survey was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students attending a large, diverse university via an electronic newsletter. The survey requested information about demographic and academic data, cardiorespiratory fitness, and depression symptoms. Paired t-tests and logistic regression were employed. Our sample (n = 194) was predominantly female (73%), young (mean age of 25), not a sexual minority (82%), and had a mean 3.4 GPA. Students reported worse depression scores (p < 0.01) and fewer minutes of PA (p = 0.01) after the stay-at-home order. There was a small but significant (p = 0.04) correlation between changes in total minutes of PA and depression scores. Senior (p = 0.05) and Hispanic (p = 0.03) students were less likely to report worsening depression scores than freshmen and white students, respectively. Asian students were significantly more likely than white students to report decreased PA. This study suggests that COVID-19 and its consequences may be contributing to reduced PA and greater depression symptoms in college students and that sub-groups have been affected differently. Targeted interventions to promote PA and support mental health may bolster the ability for resilience of college students.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on the Emergency Presentation of Acute Appendicitis. BACKGROUND: The global crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic has imposed a large burden on health systems worldwide. Nonetheless, acute abdominal surgical emergencies are major causes for nontrauma-related hospital admissions and their incidences were expected to remain unchanged. Surprisingly, a significant decrease in volume and a higher proportion of complicated cases are being observed worldwide., METHODS: The present study assesses the local impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the emergency presentation of acute appendicitis in a Brazilian hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing emergency surgery for the clinically suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the 2-month period of March and April 2020 and the same time interval in the previous year. Data on demographics, timing of symptom onset and hospital presentation, intraoperative details, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and histological examination of the specimen were retrieved from individual registries., RESULTS: The number of appendectomies during the pandemic was 36, which represents a 56% reduction compared to the 82 patients operated during the same period in 2019. The average time of symptom onset to hospital arrival was significantly higher in 2020 (40.6 vs. 28.2 hours, P = .02). The classification of appendicitis revealed a significant higher proportion of complicated cases than the previous year (33.3% vs. 15.2%, P = .04). The rate of postoperative complications and the average length of stay were not statistically different between the groups., CONCLUSION: Further assessment of patients' concerns and systematic monitoring of emergency presentations are expected to help us understand and adequately address this issue.	false
0	Head-to-head evaluation on diagnostic accuracies of six SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. In this study, we evaluated and compared six SARS-CoV-2 serology kits including the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, Beckman Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, OCD Vitros OCD Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assay, Roche Elecsys Anti SARS-CoV-2 assay, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total assay, and cPass surrogate viral neutralising antibody assay. A total of 336 non-duplicated residual serum samples that were obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients (n=173) on PCR and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic were used for the study. These were concurrently analysed on the different immunoassay platforms and correlated with clinical characteristics. Our results showed all assays had specificity ranging from 99.3% to 100.0%. Overall sensitivity across all days of symptoms, in descending order were OCD (49.1%, 95% CI 41.8-56.5%), cPass (44.8%, 95% CI 37.5-52.3%), Roche (41.6%, 95% CI 34.5-49.0%), Siemens (39.9%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%), Abbott (39.8%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%) and Beckman (39.6%, 95% CI 32.5-47.3%). Testing after at least 14 days from symptom onset is required to achieve AUCs greater than 0.80. OCD and cPass performed the best in terms of sensitivity for >21 days symptoms with 93.3% (95% CI, 73.5-99.2%) and 96.7% (95% CI, 82.8-99.9%), respectively. Both also shared the greatest concordance, kappa 0.963 (95% CI 0.885-1.0), p<0.001, and had the lowest false negative rates. Serology results should be interpreted with caution in certain cases. False negatives were observed in a small number of individuals with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive therapy, pauci-symptomatic or who received antiretroviral therapy. In conclusion, all assays exhibited excellent specificity and total antibody assays with spike protein configurations generally outperformed nucleocapsid configurations and IgG assays in terms of diagnostic sensitivity.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia	false
0	UNIVERSAL SCREENING OF COVID-19 IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS STARTING FERTILITY TREATMENT IN NEW YORK CITY. Objective: To evaluate a protocol of universal symptom and viral screening prior to initiation of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation among patients receiving care in New York City. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Material(s) and Method(s): Prior to initiation of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for oocyte cryopreservation or in vitro fertilization cycles, patients were screened by phone for symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, recent travel or contact with confirmed COVID cases. If negative, patients were scheduled for nasopharyngeal swabs at our center the following day, with visits spaced at 15 minute intervals to avoid crowding. Upon presentation for swab testing, patients were again screened for symptoms and fever. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in accordance with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, and delivered to the university's clinical microbiology laboratory. The swabs were tested using the Roche Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test, a qualitative assay, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Roche Diagnostics, USA), with results delivered in the same day. A negative test result was required prior to patients' baseline ultrasound and bloodwork the following morning. This study was conducted from April 21- May 21, 2020, Results: The study sample included 151 asymptomatic patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 149 (98.68%) tested negative for COVID-19, 1 (0.66%) tested indeterminate, 2 (1.32%) tested invalid, and 0 (0%) tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 149 patients who have tested negative, 81 have successfully undergone oocyte retrieval without complications. One patient screened positive for symptoms at the time of swab presentation and was instructed to return for testing in 2 weeks. Conclusion(s): The incidence of COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic patients seeking fertility treatment in NYC is low. We have demonstrated that fertility care can safely resume in a way to limit risk to our patients, staff, and our physicians working in the epicenter of infection.Copyright © 2020	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 virus infection: Targets and antiviral pharmacological strategies. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), transmitted person-to-person by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a threat to global public health. To present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for SARS-CoV-2, which makes it difficult for controlling the associated pandemic, limited to monitoring and containment. This situation generates a new need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares phylogenetic traits with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, antiviral medicines may provide some insight into the development of COVID-19 therapeutics. Besides that, they are being prioritized several FDA-approved drugs due to the pandemic state. Despite recent advances in the control of the current COVID-19 pandemic, challenges such as the rapid virus spread and the socioeconomic cost of this outbreak remain for the inexistence of therapeutics agents against SARS-CoV-2. From this moment, the in vivo evaluation of FDA-approved drugs, which until then appears to be effective are recommended, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, and ivermectin; besides new targets: Mpro, spike glycoprotein, and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, these investigations are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of these potential candidates, including their side effects.Copyright © 2020 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd	false
0	DECODING COVID-19: A NOVEL ROLE OF ANTITHROMBIN DEFICIENCY IN THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The mechanisms by which the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causes coagulopathy are still being studied (1,2). Herein we present a case of a 38-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit for severe COVID-19 infection. Work-up for fever of unknown origin revealed bilateral deep venous thromboses, and a mechanism of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 infection that is not well-defined in the emerging literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity (BMI 71.5 kg/m2) presented to the emergency room with fevers, malaise and myalgias for three days. He endorsed shortness of breath and cough. Vitals on presentation were temperature 38.8 degreeC, heart rate 124 beats/min, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, blood pressure 91/79 mmHg and SpO2 55 %. On non-rebreather SpO2 was 88% with increased work of breathing and crackles on examination of the chest. He was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin were started as empiric coverage for multifocal pneumonia. He tested positive for SARS-COV-2 and parainfluenza. Hydroxychloroquine was started. PaO2/FiO2 ratio worsened from 99 to 73. Interleukin 2 and 6 were 2371 pg/mL and 173 pg/mL respectively. Hemodynamics improved with Tocilizumab, pressor support and stress-dose steroids. However he had persistent fever and tachycardia after antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and meropenem. Repeat work-up was negative for new infectious source of fever. Doppler ultrasound revealed deep vein thromboses in bilateral popliteal veins. CTPE was not done due to patient's BMI of 71.5 kg/m2. High-intensity heparin drip was started. Hypercoagulability work up revealed Antithrombin Activity 71.0%, Antithrombin Antigen 56%. ANA screen and lupus anticoagulant were negative. There was clinical improvement and he tested negative for SARS-COV-2 on day 16 of treatment. He was stable for discharge by day 37. There was normalized Antithrombin Activity 93.0% and Antithrombin Antigen 85%. DISCUSSION: This case provides evidence that antithrombin 3 deficiency should be included as a differential for hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 infection. Other previously identified causes of hypercoagulability, such as lupus anticoagulant (3), were negative. Though fevers may occur in COVID-19 infection, this case shows the benefit of excluding other potential sources. High intensity heparin was started once deep vein thromboses were discovered. However other cases of antithrombin 3 deficiency may be resistant to the heparin therapy that is being used to treat venous thromboembolism in COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): Antithrombin 3 Deficiency is a mechanism for hypercoagulability and fever of unknown origin in patients with COVID-19. Recognition of these roles of antithrombin 3 deficiency, can better guide therapy in future cases as there may be resistance to the standard heparin therapy being adopted in COVID-19.

Background: In the COVID-19 pandemic, elderly people with cardiovascular risk factors and/or cardiovascular disease have been the most seriously affected. We sought to evaluate the impact of the pandemic, due to both the social confinement and the infection itself, in the population of patients older than 75 years of age with previous percutaneous coronary revascularization. Method(s): A subgroup of patients from the SIERRA 75 registry were included in the study. This is a prospective registry of patients older than 75 years undergoing percutaneous revascularization in 42 centers in Spain and Portugal. The follow-up of the patients has been updated, covering the entire period of outbreak and confinement (March 14 to May 10) through direct telephone contact to carry out a specific questionnaire for patients and their relatives. In addition, all electronic health records have been reviewed. Result(s): A total of 709 patients have been included. Among those, 17 had died in the 12.5 +/- 3.4 months follow-up prior to the start of the outbreak-confinement period. Therefore, 692 patients were followed during the study period: (mean age of 80.8 +/- 4.2 years, 37% were women, 83% with hypertension, 44% with diabetes, 75% with previous STEMI/NSTEMI, 100% with previous PCI). During this period, 11 (1.6%) had confirmed COVID-19 (age 81.2 +/- 5 years, 36% women). Eight were admitted to the hospital but none in the ICU. Among the 11 cases, 2 (18%) died, an 80-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman, both in the hospital. COVID-19 incidence was higher than in the global population in the region (1.6% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.0001). During this period of confinement, 91 patients (13%) presented cardiac symptoms (21 stable angina, 82 dyspnea and 6 syncope). Medical attention was demanded by 43 (6.2%), of whom 22 were admitted to the hospital. There were 4 (0.6%) cases with acute coronary syndrome and 4 (0.6%) underwent revascularization. Death was reported in 7 (1%) patients (2 due to COVID-19, 4 due to cardiovascular disease, and 1 due to multiple pathologies). The monthly mortality rate in this period was 2.6 times higher than in the previous months. Outpatient visits were canceled in 119 cases (17%) but 108 were contacted by phone. Conclusion(s): In this elderly population with coronary artery disease revascularized before the pandemic, an increase in cardiovascular and general morbidity as well as in total mortality was observed during the outbreak and confinement. Incidence of COVID-19 was higher than in the general population. Mortality among COVID-19 patients was very high. Categories Other: COVID-19Copyright © 2020	false

0	Considerations for the Management of Oncology Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Worldwide incidence and mortality due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is greatest in the United States, with the initial epicenter in New York. In Nassau County, New York, where we practice, our institution has had more than 2500 cases and has discharged from the hospital more than 1000 patients. As many academic and private institutions have swiftly shifted their clinical and research priorities to address the pandemic, data are emerging regarding both the impact of malignancy on COVID-19 outcomes as well as the challenges faced in assuring that cancer care remains unimpeded. Of concern, recent studies of cancer patients primarily in China and Italy have suggested that advanced malignancy is associated with increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection. At present, more than 500 clinical trials are underway investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19, including expanded use of oncology drugs, such as small molecular inhibitors of cytokine pathways. Here, we begin by reviewing the latest understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and then focus our attention on the impact of this virus on hematologic and oncologic practice. Finally, we highlight ongoing investigational treatment approaches that are so relevant to the care of oncology patients during this extraordinary pandemic.	false
0	Status quo and review of clinical application of antibody detection for 2019-nCoV. With the gradual progress of epidemic prevention and control work, the process of epidemic prevention and control in COVID-19 has entered a critical period. As the main method to diagnose patients with COVID-19,the disadvantages of nucleic acid detection are gradually revealed. As an important immune response product, specific antibodies have been rapidly applied to the laboratory detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), combined with nucleic acid detection for rapid diagnosis and screening of patients with COVID-19. This paper explores and discusses the production pattern and common detection methods of 2019-nCoV specific antibodies and the application and limitations of antibody detection in the clinical work to promote the application and development of specific antibody in COVID-19 diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	Alternative clinical specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review. The collection of nasopharyngeal swabs to test for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an invasive technique with implications for patients and clinicians. Alternative clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract may offer benefits in terms of collection, comfort and infection risk. The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tested saliva or nasal specimens compared with RT-PCR tested nasopharyngeal specimens. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and NHS evidence from December 2019 to 20 July 2020. Eighteen studies were identified; 12 for saliva, four for nasal and two included both specimen types. For saliva-based studies, the proportion of saliva samples testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 82.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 76.7% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 65.4% to 100%. For nasal-based studies, the proportion of nasal swabs testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 81.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 70% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 62.3% to 100%. The results indicate an inconsistency in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the specimen types included, often with neither the index nor the reference of interest detecting all known cases. Depending on the test environment, these clinical specimens may offer a viable alternative to standard. However, at present the evidence is limited, of variable quality, and relatively inconsistent.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	SARS-COV, MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 comparison of three emerging coronaviruses. In December 2019, in Wuhan, China began the outbreak of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. As a result of rapid spread, it turned into a pandemic announced by WHO on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological factor of a new disease called COVID-19. The virus is transmitted mainly through the droplet route. In most cases, it causes mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, weakness, and muscle pain; less common symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, and chills. However, among people with impaired immunity and comorbidities, as well as among older people, it leads to lifethreatening complications in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic in humans and easily spreading coronavirus after the virus of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 and virus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. This review summarizes current information on the emergence, origin, diversity, and common characteristics, as well as the epidemiology of the above three highly contagious coronaviruses.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).	false
0	Neurological manifestations of Coronavirus Infections: Role of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in COVID-19. In December 2019, a highly pathogenic coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (formerly identified as2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan, China, and has since been spreading rapidly around the world. The most specific manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 patients is pulmonary distress, and several patients admitted to intensive care units were not able to breathe spontaneously. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has a significant effect on nervous systems and may even lead to serious neurological damage. The neuroinvasive pathobiology is still not fully elucidated and thus the effect of CoV infections on the nervous system needs to be explored. The spike protein of the virus and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) lead to the presence of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the cells and, subsequently,decreased ACE2 expression. The therapeutic possibilities of ACE2 antibody, ACE2-derived peptides, and small molecule blockers of ACE2 include a receptor-binding domain blocking approach. Hence,future studies of ACE2 may be very helpful in discovering a therapy for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the neurological manifestations of this infection and the potential of ACE2 in the nervous system.	false
0	Management of severe hyperinflammation in the COVID-19 era: the role of the rheumatologist. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (i) to describe the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally related to Sars-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in children; (ii) to propose a framework to guide multidisciplinary team (MDT) management; and (iii) to highlight the role of the paediatric rheumatologist in this context., METHODS: This study involved a retrospective case notes review of patients referred to a single specialist paediatric centre with suspected PIMS-TS, with a focus on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome in the context of an MDT framework., RESULTS: Nineteen children of median age 9.1 years fulfilled the definition of PIMS-TS and were managed within an MDT framework: 5/19 were female; 14/19 were of Black, Asian or minority ethnicity; 9/19 also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). Severe systemic inflammation, shock, and abdominal pain were ubiquitous. Treatment was stratified within an MDT framework and included CSs in all; i.v. immunoglobulin in all; anakinra in 4/19; infliximab in 1/19; and antiviral (aciclovir) in 4/19., CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant diagnostic equipoise using a current definition of PIMS-TS, overlapping with KD. Outside of clinical trials, an MDT approach is vital. The role of the paediatric rheumatologist is to consider differential diagnoses of hyperinflammation in the young, to advise on empiric immunomodulatory therapy, to set realistic therapeutic targets, to gauge therapeutic success, to oversee timely step-down of immunomodulation, and to contribute to the longer-term MDT follow-up of any late inflammatory sequelae.

0	An impact of national lockdown towards emergency department visits and admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand: A hospital-based study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic towards the Emergency Department (ED) visits and admission rates in Thailand. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical database of patients presenting to the ED during the national lockdown period (26 March to 30 June 2020). We used the same time interval in the year 2019 as the control period in our analysis. We collected baseline characteristics and outcomes of each patient in the ED. The primary outcome was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the average daily ED visits. Secondary outcomes included the IRR with 95% CI of total admissions and ICU admissions. RESULT(S): The average number of daily ED visits decreased significantly from 89.1 to 57.0 (-36.0%, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.70). However, the proportions of 'Resuscitation' and 'Emergency' triage level were increased (29.1% vs. 19.2%, p<0.001). Total ED admission rate and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate were also increased (33.5% vs. 28.3%, p<0.001 and 10.2% vs. 7.5%, p<0.001, respectively). The IRR for the admission rate was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26), and the IRR for the ICU admission rate was 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.52). CONCLUSION(S): The national lockdown in Thailand was associated with a significant reduction in average daily ED visits across traumatic and non-traumatic patients. Communication from healthcare professionals and public health officers is necessary to reinforce the importance of timely ED visits for acute health conditions.

0	Thrombosis and COVID-19: The Potential Role of Nutrition. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is a contagion that has rapidly spread around the globe. COVID-19 has caused significant loss of life and disrupted global society at a level never before encountered. While the disease was predominantly characterized by respiratory symptoms initially, it became clear that other systems including the cardiovascular and neurological systems were also involved. Several thrombotic complications were reported including venous thrombosis, vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, and stroke. Thrombosis and inflammation are implicated in various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This is of significant concern as people with pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, renal disorders, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Consequently, the research surrounding the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 is of critical importance. The adoption of a healthy diet, physical exercise, and lifestyle choices can reduce the risk factors associated with NCDs and the thrombo-inflammatory complications. In this review, these thrombotic complications and potential foods, nutraceuticals, and the antithrombotic constituents within that may prevent the onset of severe thrombotic complications as a result of infection are discussed. While nutrition is not a panacea to tackle COVID-19, it is apparent that a patient's nutritional status may affect patient outcomes. Further intensive research is warranted to reduce to incidence of thrombotic complications. Copyright © 2020 Tsoupras, Lordan and Zabetakis.	false
0	COVID-19: Molecular and serological detection methods. Since COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared as a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization in early 2020, many countries, organizations and companies have tried to find the best way to diagnose the virus and contain its spreading. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single RNA (+ssRNA) coronavirus and mainly spreads through droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact. The early detection of the virus plays a central role in lowering COVID19 incidents and mortality rates. Thus, finding a simple, accurate, cheap and quick detection approach for SARS-CoV-2 at early stage of the viral infection is urgent and at high demand all around the world. The Food and Drug Administration and other health agencies have declared Emergency Use Authorization to develop diagnostic methods for COVID-19 and fulfill the demand. However, not all developed methods are appropriate and selecting a suitable method is challenging. Among all detection methods, rRT-PCR is the gold standard method. Unlike molecular methods, serological methods lack the ability of early detection with low accuracy. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge about COVID-19 detection methods aiming to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of molecular and serological methods.Copyright 2020 Dhamad and Abdal Rhida.	false
0	Mini-Review on the Roles of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Selenium in the Immune System against COVID-19. Low levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections. Therefore, to maximize the nutritional defense against infections, a daily allowance of vitamins and trace elements for malnourished patients at risk of or diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be beneficial. Recent studies on COVID-19 patients have shown that vitamin D and selenium deficiencies are evident in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D improves the physical barrier against viruses and stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides. It may prevent cytokine storms by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. Selenium enhances the function of cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, selenium is important for maintaining T cell maturation and functions, as well as for T cell-dependent antibody production. Vitamin C is considered an antiviral agent as it increases immunity. Administration of vitamin C increased the survival rate of COVID-19 patients by attenuating excessive activation of the immune response. Vitamin C increases antiviral cytokines and free radical formation, decreasing viral yield. It also attenuates excessive inflammatory responses and hyperactivation of immune cells. In this mini-review, the roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, and selenium in the immune system are discussed in relation to COVID-19.	false
0	COVID-19: Insight into the asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection and transmission. The existence of a substantial but unclear number of asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients worldwide has raised concerns among global public health authorities. In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients.Copyright © The author(s).	false
0	Extracorporeal Hemoperfusion as a Potential Therapeutic Option for Severe COVID-19 patients; a Narrative Review. The 2019 novel coronavirus (officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV2) was first found in Wuhan, China. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as an emergency of international concern. Based on the current epidemiological surveys, some COVID-19 patients with severe infection gradually develop impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI), multiple organ failure, and ultimately, death. Currently, there is no established pharmacotherapy available for COVID-19. As seen in influenza, immune damage mediated by excessive production of inflammatory mediators contributes to high incidence of complications and poor prognosis. Thus, removal or blocking the overproduction of these mediators potentially aids in reducing the deleterious cytokine storm and improving critically ill patients' outcomes. Based on previous experience of blood purification to treat cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), here we aimed to review the current literature on extracorporeal hemoperfusion as a potential therapeutic option for CSS-associated conditions, with a focus on severe COVID-19.	false
0	Utilization and Results of Repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing in a Presumptive Low Prevalence Population. INTRODUCTION: Early reports have raised concerns regarding the clinical sensitivity of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for patients with COVID-19 symptoms, which has led to requests for repeat testing at our institution. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice., METHODS: The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed., RESULTS: Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%., CONCLUSION: In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases.

0	Research initiatives of blood services worldwide in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Background and Objectives While coronavirus (COVID-19) is not transfusion-transmitted, the impact of the global pandemic on blood services worldwide is complex. Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. Materials and Methods Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. Results A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. Conclusion Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency. It is important to track and coordinate research efforts across jurisdictions to gain a composite evidence-based view that will influence future practice and preparative strategies.	false
0	Quality Assessment of the Chinese Clinical Trial Protocols Regarding Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background: With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an increasing number of clinical trials are being designed and executed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19. We conducted this survey to assess the methodological quality of registry protocols on potential treatments for COVID-19. Method(s): Clinical trial protocols were identified on the ClinicalTrials.gov and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Protocols were screened by two investigators independently against pre-defined eligibility criteria. Quality of the included protocols was assessed according to the modified 14-item SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 Statement. Result(s): We included 82 randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocols investigating treatment modalities for COVID-19. These ongoing trials are being conducted in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China, and study interventions were either Western medicines (n = 56) or traditional Chinese medicine (n = 26). Findings of our quality assessment indicated that the existing trial protocols could be further improved on several aspects, including selection and definition of outcome measures, descriptions of study interventions and comparators, study subject recruitment time, definition of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and allocation concealment methods. Descriptions of random sequence generation methodologies were accurate for the majority of included trial protocols (n = 64; 78.05%); however, reporting of allocation concealment remained unclear in 63 (76.83%) protocols. Therefore, the overall risk of selection bias across these RCTs was judged to be unclear. A total of 52 (63.41%) included RCT protocols were open-label trials and are thus associated with a high risk of performance bias and detection bias. Conclusion(s): Quality of currently available RCT protocols on the treatments for COVID-19 could be further improved. For transparency and effective knowledge translation in real-world clinically settings, it is important for trial investigators to standardize baseline treatments for patients with COVID-19 and assess clinically important core outcome measures. Despite eager anticipation from the public on the results of effectiveness trials in COVID-19, robust design, execution, and reporting of these trials should be regarded as high priority.© Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Lu, Kwong, Li, Zheng and He.	false

0	Overview of management of children with COVID-19. The widespread and contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become a burden in the global health domain. The subsequent discovery of the virus features and pathogenesis, and prompt and adequate management are still lacking and remain inconclusive. Children usually present milder symptoms than adults, and management focuses on providing symptomatic and respiratory supports. Several treatment modalities, including the utilization of mechanical ventilation (MV), antivirals, immune-modulating drugs, or other agents, may present promising results in reducing the symptoms of COVID-19, particularly in severe cases. Although no randomized clinical trials have been published to date, it is interesting to explore potential modalities for treating COVID-19 in children, based on review articles, case reports, and recent guidelines.Copyright © 2020 by The Korean Pediatric Society.	false
0	Laboratory diagnostics in COVID-19: What we know so far. COVID-19 took the world by storm in early 2020 which rapidly escalated to a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Containment of the outbreak requires a robust public health system of surveillance, contact tracing and laboratory preparedness. Technological advancement in molecular diagnosticshas helped identify patients in the initial stages of the outbreak. RT-PCR remains the gold standard in COVID-19 testing. However, as the pandemic continues, there is need for rapid and point of care tests (POCT) for mass screening and rapid decision making. Current serological tests and POCT have high sensitivity but need to be interpreted with caution. This review aims to discuss current laboratory tests available for the diagnosis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.	false
0	Global vitamin c status and prevalence of deficiency: A cause for concern?. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that must be obtained through the diet in adequate amounts to prevent hypovitaminosis C, deficiency and its consequences-including the potentially fatal deficiency disease scurvy. Global vitamin C status and prevalence of deficiency has not previously been reported, despite vitamin C's pleiotropic roles in both non-communicable and communicable disease. This review highlights the global literature on vitamin C status and the prevalence of hypovitaminosis C and deficiency. Related dietary intake is reported if assessed in the studies. Overall, the review illustrates the shortage of high quality epidemiological studies of vitamin C status in many countries, particularly low-and middle-income countries. The available evidence indicates that vitamin C hypovitaminosis and deficiency is common in low-and middle-income countries and not uncommon in high income settings. Further epidemiological studies are required to confirm these findings, to fully assess the extent of global vitamin C insufficiency, and to understand associations with a range of disease processes. Our findings suggest a need for interventions to prevent deficiency in a range of at risk groups and regions of the world.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Covid-19 Pandemic: Through the Lens of Science, a Painstaking Review. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has imperiled human lives and global infrastructure since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China. The current review meticulously summarizes the COVID-19 pandemic situation through the lens of science from the inception of the outbreak to the current progression, which is valuable to mitigate the current pandemic situation. METHOD(S): We reviewed all the relevant literature available on PubMed, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and World Health Organization (WHO) website related to COVID-19 from the inception of the outbreak to 18 June 2020. We selected ninety different scientific studies and reports to compile the current review. RESULT(S): Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus with four major structural proteins encoded by S, M, E, and N genes and distinct in morphology. The potential provenance of SARS-Cov-2 is zoonotic, and it binds to the host cell receptors by spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle carries on through direct contact, air, inanimate objects, and contaminated surfaces. The reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2 to 3.5, representing that one infected patient can spread this virus to two to three people. An expeditious laboratory diagnosis has a pivotal role in patient management and prevention. Due to the lack of definitive treatment, symptomatic medication regimen and supportive organ therapies are adapted for debilitated patients. CONCLUSION(S): Nucleoside analogs and protease-inhibitors have approved to attenuate the viral infection until the discovery of a specific drug. The other treatment strategies comprise antimalarial drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and glucocorticoids. The use of alcoholic scrubs, sodium hypochlorite, masks, social distancing, and quarantine the affected individual is inevitable to eradicate the infection vector and to break the transmission path.	false
0	Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons learnt from recent studies to define future applications. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is successful in the detection of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This review examines the methods used and results of recent studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. WBE becomes essential, especially with virus transmission path uncertainty, limitations on the number of clinical tests that could be conducted, and a relatively long period for infected people to show symptoms. Wastewater surveillance was used to show the effect of lockdown on the virus spread. A WBE framework tailored for SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates lessons learnt from the reviewed studies was developed. Results of the review helped outline challenges facing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. A comparison between the various studies with regards to sample concentration and virus quantification was conducted. Five different primers sets were used for qPCR quantification; however, due to limited data availability, there is no consensus on the most sensitive primer. Correlating the slope of the relationship between the number of gene copies vs. the cumulative number of infections normalized to the total population served with the average new cases, suggests that qPCR results could help estimating the number of new infections. The correlation is improved when a lag period was introduced to account for asymptomatic infections. Based on lessons learnt from recent studies, it is recommended that future applications should consider the following: 1) ensuring occupational safety in managing sewage collection and processing, 2) evaluating the effectiveness of greywater disinfection, 3) measuring viral RNA decay due to biological and chemical activities during collection and treatment, 4) assessing the effectiveness of digital PCR, and 5) conducting large scale international studies that follow standardized protocols.

0	Tocilizumab exerts anti-inflammatory activity in six critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective analysis. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic, affecting countries across the globe. With no current vaccine, treatment is still a critical intervention for minimizing morbidity and preventing disease-specific mortality. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients using Tocilizumab treatment to provide recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of medical records of six critically ill patients admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, China, from January 11 to February 26, 2020. Patient-related outcomes, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics before and after the initiation of Tocilizumab, were descriptively analyzed. Four to eight milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) of Tocilizumab was prescribed, with Chinese treatment guidelines. Result(s): By the end of the last follow-up, Patient 1 and Patient 2 developed complications and died after using Tocilizumab for three to four days. Patient 4 died of multiple organ failure caused by cerebral infarction after using Tocilizumab for 39 days. Patient 3 and Patient 6 were discharged after 29 days and 33 days on Tocilizumab, respectively. Clinical symptoms, including fever, heart rate, and oxygen levels, improved after Tocilizumab use. Two patients appeared transient abnormal of liver or renal function indicator, and they can gradually recover. All elevated serum levels of inflammatory factors gradually decreased, except in Patient 2. Patient 3 and Patient 6's inflammatory lesions also significantly improved after initiating Tocilizumab. Conclusion(s): Anti-inflammatory treatment with Tocilizumab was found to improve inflammatory responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Although some side reactions will occur, patients can gradually recover without affecting the efficacy of the therapy. However, the proper timing to start patients on Tocilizumab patients should be explored. Further prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials are called for.Copyright © 2020 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.	false

The causative agento f the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, and in the first months of 2020 it spread throughout the world as a pandemic. Method(s): The most relevant publications concerned with the aims of the review were examined. Result(s): The disease, known as COVID-19. Patients show cough, fever, and respiratory distress. The most severe forms, mainly affecting the elderly and associated with various comorbidities, are manifested by impaired respiratory function, requiring mechanical ventilation, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which can lead to septic shock with multi-organ failure and high mortality rates. This review examines the current state of knowledge about the characteristics and origin of SARS-CoV-2, its replication, and the pathogenesis, clinical, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are well known. PCR is the reference technique for laboratory diagnosis; assays for the detection of antigens and antibodies are available, with optimization possibilities. Treatment protocols include attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response and administration of antiviral agents. There are vaccines in development.Copyright © 2020 Editorial Universida de Granada. All rights reserved.	false
0	Treatment strategies to fight the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: A challenge for a Rubik's Cube solver. SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the new lung disease COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV, and together with MERS-CoV are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation with higher transmissibility and infectivity compared with SARS and MERS. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness. The prevalent cause of mortality is pneumonia that progresses to ARDS. The ongoing pandemic has already resulted in more than 135,000 deaths and an unprecedented burden on national health systems worldwide. Pending the availability of a vaccine, there is a critical need to identify effective treatments and a number of clinical trials have been implemented worldwide. Trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other infections, have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy at present, as it is still unclear how well these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Most of those emerging re-introduced drugs are administered to patients in the context of clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the strategies currently employed in the treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Insights into the COVID-19 pandemic: Origin, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the human coronavirus (HCoV) family that targets the lower part of the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In a short span of time, this infection has led to a global pandemic and has become a significant threat to the existence of present human society. Currently, there are no treatments for this infection and the measures established across various countries such as social distancing, usage of mask to prevent entry of the virus into the respiratory tract, quarantine, and containment together have reduced the prevalence of this disease and mortality in highly susceptible individuals. Here, we examine the structure, replication cycle, phylogeny and genomic organization of this virus and discuss the role of spike (S) protein of the virus, an important structure that interacts with the host ACE2 receptor facilitating viral entry. Further, we explore the epidemiology, symptoms of the disease, describe the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that establishes the diagnosis of the disease and also review its unique diagnostic features in the chest CT-Scan. Finally, we review the current approaches to develop therapies and vaccines as a measure for disease prevention and control.	false

0	Dendritic cells in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis: insights for a possible role in determining disease outcome. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This novel coronavirus emerged in China, quickly spreading to more than 200 countries worldwide. Although most patients are only mildly ill or even asymptomatic, some develop severe pneumonia and become critically ill. One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.	false
0	A PAN-POSITIVE, RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE PULMONARY RENAL PUZZLER. SESSION TITLE: Fellows Pulmonary Manifestations of Systemic Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Fellow Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: A 78-year-old male with history of aortic sclerosis and anemia was admitted with two weeks of dyspnea, profound weakness, cough, and orthopnea. On presentation he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with normal oxygen saturations but was notably tachypneic which improved on simple nasal cannula. On exam he had bilateral crackles to auscultation posteriorly with no peripheral edema. Labs revealed hemoglobin 5.6g/dL with MCV 112.1, new acute kidney injury with creatinine 1.8mg/dL, and mildly elevated total and indirect bilirubin. B-type natriuretic peptide was 518pg/mL. Chest x-ray showed bilateral left greater than right hazy opacities. CASE PRESENTATION: Initial concern was for Covid-19 with superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics he declined over the following two days and was ultimately intubated. He was noted to have a small blood clot in his posterior oropharynx at intubation. Following two negative Covid-19 rt-PCR he underwent bronchoscopy with BAL that showed no blood in large airways but grossly bloody lavage return from right middle lobe and lingula. Further workup was significant for elevated CRP (150 mg/dL), ANA 1:320 (homogenous) with weakly positive anti-histone antibodies, elevated anticardiolipin and anti-beta-2 microglobulin IgM, and positive p-ANCA with titer 1:640 and elevated anti-MPO and anti-PR3. Due to worsening creatinine he underwent renal biopsy which revealed crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis without thrombotic microangiopathy, and with IgG and C3 deposition. After initiation of high dose steroids and rituximab the patient rapidly improved, was extubated and transferred to the floor. Plasma exchange was deferred due to stabilization. Further chart review revealed that he had been taking hydralazine for several years in increasing doses, most recently increased two months prior to his presentation. DISCUSSION: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage should be suspected in patients with systemic symptoms, anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. High dose steroids should be empirically started if there is high suspicion for inflammatory cause, particularly in the presence of concurrent renal dysfunction. Immunomodulatory agents such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab should then be initiated based on serologies or pathology, as well as plasma exchange in patients with rapidly declining renal function or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with respiratory compromise. CONCLUSION(S): Unexpected overlap in rheumatologic markers should prompt consideration of drug-induced vasculitis. Hydralazine induced vasculitis in particular is commonly associated with dual ANCA positivity with concurrent antiphospholipid and antihistone antibodies. Renal biopsy shows pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and may also show IgM, IgG and C3 deposits without immune complexes. Management consists of halting the offending agent and long-term immunosuppression. Reference #1: Babar, F., Posner, J. N., & Obah, E. A. (2016).

Objectives: To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and no criteria for hospitalisation. Trial design: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label controlled superiority trial. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:1 to the following strategies:Arm 1: Control armArms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial. Participant(s): Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale >=7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage >=B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations. Intervention and comparator: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalite), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. Main outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. Randomisation: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). Blinding (masking): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim ndegree3 and final) will be performed successively. Trial Status: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15th, 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15th, 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age >=65 replaced by age >=60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites. Trial registration: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22nd, 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10th, 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27).

0	ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND MYOCARDIAL INJURY IN COVID-19 PATIENT. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Pulmonary Vascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) main presenting feature is hypoxia which coincidentally is a feature of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. COVID-19 causes excessive inflammation that can induce expression tissue factors, which is a major coagulation activator1,2. Therefore, PE should also be a consideration for those presenting with COVID-19 with worsening hypoxia. CASE PRESENTATION: 79-year-old a man with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with Ejection Fraction (EF) 45- 50% presented with worsening shortness of breath, dry cough, and bilateral lower limb edema for 2 weeks. On presentation, he was afebrile normotensive with tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. On physical examination, he was in respiratory distress with faint bilateral crackles and bilateral lower limb edema. Lab Investigations showed elevated Brain Natriuretic Peptide to 1830 pg/ml (normal range 0-100 PG/ml), troponin level to 6.89 ng/ml (normal range 0.00-0.03 ng/ml) and the D-dimer level was >20.00 UG/ml FEU (normal range 0.00-0.40 UG/ml FEU). Viral PCR confirmed COVID-19. No ischemic changes noted in EKG. Echocardiography (Echo) revealed EF (Ejection Fraction) at 10-15%, dilated right ventricle with reduced function, and left ventricular thrombus. In CT chest with contrast noted to have acute segmental right middle lobe pulmonary arterial embolus. He was therapeutically anti-coagulated with enoxaparin. He received antibiotics, systemic steroids, and diuresis On day 3 of admission, he had worsening hypoxia and dyspnea while on 100% oxygen therapy. The patient opted for no escalation in care with ventilation or resuscitation. As he had no clinical improvement, the family agreed on comfort care. He died on day 5 of admission. DISCUSSION: We described a case of COVID-19 complicated by PE, which is found among 13% of COVID-19 patients in a study done in Netherland1. Studies showed that elevated D-dimer levels can correlate with risk for pulmonary embolism. In this case, D-dimer found to be elevated which is consistent with prior cases 3. The patient found to have cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction at 15% during presentation despite prior Echo done about 6 months earlier revealed an EF 45%. Evidence of myocardial injury was found in previous articles from China as found in 19.7% of patients (total 416) with evidence of cardiac injury including elevated troponin and reduced ejection fraction. It was noted to be independently associated with a higher risk of mortality 4. CONCLUSION(S): Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in COVID19 patients may represent a diagnostic challenge as hypoxia is arguably the feature of COVID19 that could be explained by a viral lung infection. Thus, it is necessary to have a lower index of suspicion and CT chest to be considered in patients with worsening hypoxia so as to evaluate for pulmonary embolism especially among patients with an elevated D- dimer level.

0	SARS-COV-2 INDUCED MYOCARDITIS. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Cardiovascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The cardiac implications of Covid-19 are variable. Here we describe a gentleman with Covid-19 induced myocarditis with resultant atrial fibrillation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39 year-old male with no past medical history presented to the hospital with fevers and lower extremity swelling that started 7 days prior. In the ED an EKG revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR, while a TTE showed newly reduced EF of 10%. An infectious workup was conducted and positive for Covid-19. Inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP were found to be significantly elevated, along with mildly elevated troponin T which remained flat. Other etiologies of heart failure such as valvular disease, thyroid disorders, etc. were ruled out. Coronary angiography was deferred as suspicion for ACS remained low. It was noted that the patient's heart rate began to normalize as the fevers improved and the markers of inflammation decreased. Cardiac MRI was performed which revealed late gadolinium enhancement involving the subepicardium, consistent with myocardial injury and a diagnosis of myocarditis. Prior to discharge, the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm and repeat bedside echocardiogram suggested moderate improvement in ejection fraction. Patient was discharged medically stable with a repeat TTE scheduled to be performed in three months. DISCUSSION: The patient was suspected to have Covid-19 induced myocarditis leading to atrial fibrillation. Acute myocarditis is supported by new onset heart failure developing over the course of three months or less. It is further characterized by symptom onset following a GI or respiratory infection and/or dysrhythmias. This patient's cardiomyopathy occurred during the acute phase of a Covid-19 infection. Other typical etiologies of viral myocarditis such as coxsackie B were ruled out via negative respiratory viral panel and serologic titers. While there is limited knowledge on Covid-19 induced myocarditis, the presumed mechanism is thought to be secondary to direct viral damage and cytokine expression. Furthermore, these cytokines, including CRP and IL-6, produce oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that leads to cardiac remodeling precipitating atrial fibrillation. This patient's dysrhythmia was noted to improve as inflammatory markers improved. While myocarditis was considered to be the precipitant of this patient's cardiomyopathy-induced atrial fibrillation, the severely elevated inflammatory markers were presumed to play a secondary role. CONCLUSION(S): The importance of this case highlights the severe cardiac manifestations of the novel SARS-COV-2 virus. With continued research and awareness, it is reasonable for clinicians to include Covid-19 on the differential for viral myocarditis.

0	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 537 CASES OF COVID-19 IN DIFFERENT ALTITUDE OF SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: There are no published studies concerning the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resident in high altitude. We aim to analyze the unique cohort and investigated the relationship among the patients resident in different altitude areas of Sichuan province, China. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical data including clinical features, imaging findings, laboratory characteristics and received treatment of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in Sichuan province from Jan 12th to March 12th, 2020. Outcomes were also compared between patients from high-altitude and non-high-altitude area. RESULT(S): 537 patients were included in this study, 78 were from high-altitude area and 459 from non-high-altitude area. The high-altitude area group was less likely had a clear travel history of Wuhan (9.0% vs. 64.3%, p<0.001) or contact with people from Wuhan (10.3% vs. 25.5%, p=0.003) within recent two weeks, but more likely contact with people infected of COVID-19 never been to Wuhan (60.3% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001) or of unknown origin (20.5% vs.7.0%, p<0.001). The high-altitude area group was more likely asymptomatic before admission (50.6% vs. 8.7%, p<0.001). Less patients with cough, sputum production and fever in the cohort comparing with those in non-high-altitude area. Lower body temperature, slower heart rate, and lower blood pressure relatively on admission were also found in high-altitude patients as well. The period from onset of illness to visit was 3 days (range, 1-7 days) and to diagnosis was 4 days (range,1-7 days), which were both significantly shorter in the group of high-altitude area. The patients from high-altitude had significantly higher lymphocyte count, lower platelet count and lower level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p all<0.05). Less patients with abnormally elevated C-reactive protein were also observed in high-altitude group (p<0.05). The most common patterns seen in these population on chest CT were bilateral distribution, ground-glass opacity, and consolidation and nodules. Multifocal distribution and consolidation were noted and showed significant in high-altitude patients. The proportion of patients with mild illness was significantly higher in the high-altitude area group (16[20.5%] vs. 33[7.2%], p<0.001). More likely to receiving antiviral and glucocorticoid therapies and less likely to receiving antibiotic drugs were shown in the patients in high-altitude area. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age, gender, diabetes and recent travel history of Wuhan were predictors of severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION(S): The disease severity of COVID-19 in Sichuan province was milder than Wuhan. More patients in high-altitude area were asymptomatic. It could owe to the active prevention, early detection and timely treatment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Active prevention, early detection and timely treatment is critical in COVID-19.

0	Adjusting working conditions and evaluating the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic in different workplace settings in Germany: a study protocol for an explorative modular mixed methods approach. INTRODUCTION: Currently, many countries, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, discuss how the 'lockdown-restrictions' could be lifted to restart the economy and public life after the first wave of the COVID-19 disease has subsided. This study protocol describes an approach designed to provide an in-depth understanding of how companies and their employees in Germany deal with their working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also interested in how and why the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could vary across different professional activities, company sites and regions with different epidemiological activity or infection control measures in Germany. We expect the results of this study to contribute to the development of working conditions protecting the health of employees during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An explorative multimodal mixed methods approach will be applied. Module 1 comprises a document analysis of prevailing federal and regional laws and regulations at the respective location of the participating company. Module 2 includes qualitative interviews with key actors at different companies. Module 3 is a repeated standardised employee survey designed to capture potential changes in the participants' experiences and attitudes towards working conditions, occupational safety regulations/measures, and infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Module 4 comprises SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence testing. This is carried out by the medical service of the participating company sites as a voluntary offer for employees.

0	Mental wellbeing during the lockdown period following the COVID-19 pandemic in nepal: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected all aspects of society, including mental and physical health. Often missed is the fact that the pandemic is occurring against the backdrop of a very high prevalence of mental health issues. Protecting the mental health of people and healthcare workers is important for long-term positive health outcomes and proper control of the outbreak. Method(s): This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review committee of Nepal Health Research Council (reference no. 2467). Open access, pre-validated questionnaires were used. Participants with significantly poor Mental wellbeing were identified using the WHO well-being index threshold score. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Result(s): Five hundred and fifty-six participants were included in the analysis. Forty percent of the participants reported a WHO well-being index score of below 13, indicative of poor mental wellbeing and a need for further assessment for depression. Poor Mental wellbeing was more prevalent among participants less than 30 years of age, female gender, never married, diagnosed mental disorder, living alone and those using informal sources for COVID-19 related information. More participants with lower sleep quality score and higher perceived stress score reported poor Mental wellbeing. Conclusion(s): Combating this challenge requires integration across disciplines. One potential part of the solution is psychological intervention teams. An emerging positive connotation to the pandemic is that it needs to be harnessed as a tool for improving health facilities, community participation, and fighting misinformation.Copyright © 2020, Nepal Medical Association.

0	Symptomatic COVID-19 infections in outpatient image-guided corticosteroid injection patients during the lockdown phase. BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain is a debilitating problem treated with image-guided corticosteroid injections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple societies issued caution statements because of the unknown effect of corticosteroids on the patient's immune system. The purpose is to determine if image-guided corticosteroid injections administered during the COVID-19 lockdown phase were associated with a higher infection rate compared to the general population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, patients undergoing image-guided corticosteroid injections for pain management during the lockdown phase between April 15 and May 22, 2020, were enrolled. One month after the injection, patients were surveyed by telephone for any COVID-19-related symptoms, and the electronic medical record (EMR) was reviewed for symptoms and test results., RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects were recruited, 31 (44%) females, 40 (56%) males, ages 58 +/- 17 (20-92) years. Follow-up was available in 66 (93%) of subjects, 60 (91%) by phone survey and EMR, 6 (9%) by EMR only, 45 +/- 22 (19-83) days after injection. One (1/66, 1.52%; 95% CI 0.04-8.2%) 25-year-old male subject developed symptomatic infection 19 days after a tibiotalar injection. The prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the state of Massachusetts was 0.91% (62,726/6,892,503) during the study period. There was no significant difference in the rate of occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 infection between the corticosteroid injection group and the general population (p = 0.44)., CONCLUSION: Image-guided corticosteroid injections for pain management performed during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were not associated with a higher infection rate compared to the general population.	false
0	Venous thromboembolism and COVID-19: a single center experience from an academic tertiary referral hospital of Northern Italy. Preliminary evidence supports the notion that COVID-19 patients may have an increased susceptibility to develop venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the magnitude of this association still needs to be defined. Furthermore, clinical predictors of thrombogenesis, and the relationship with the inflammatory status are currently unknown. On this basis, we conducted a retrospective, observational study on 259 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy between March 19th and April 6th, 2020. Records of COVID-19 patients with a definite VTE event were reviewed for demographic information, co-morbidities, risk factors for VTE, laboratory tests, and anticoagulation treatment. Twenty-five cases among 259 COVID-19 patients developed VTE (9.6%), all of them having a Padua score > 4, although being under standard anticoagulation prophylaxis since hospital admission. In the VTE subcohort, we found a significant positive correlation between platelet count (PLT) and either C reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.0001) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0013), while a significant inverse correlation was observed between PLT and mean platelet volume (p < 0.0001). Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001). The majority of VTE patients was male and younger compared to non-VTE patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005, respectively). No significant difference was found in d-dimer levels between VTE and non VTE patients, while significantly higher levels of LDH (p = 0.04) and IL-6 (p = 0.04) were observed in VTE patients in comparison to non-VTE patients. In conclusion, our findings showed a quite high prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Raised inflammatory indexes and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines should raise the clinical suspicion of VTE.	false

0	Humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; implications in pathogenesis and protective immunity. The magnitude and the quality of humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with clinical outcome. Although the elicitation of humoral responses against different viral proteins is rapid and occurs in most infected individuals, its magnitude is highly variable among them and positively correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. This rapid response is characterized by the almost concomitant appearance of virus-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies that contain neutralizing antibodies directed against different epitopes of the Spike glycoprotein. Of particularly interest, the antibodies against domain of the Spike that interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD), are present in most infected individuals and are block viral entry and infectivity. Such neutralizing antibodies protect different animal species when administered before virus exposure; therefore, its elicitation is the main target of current vaccine approaches and their clinical use as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being explored. Yet, little information exists on the duration of humoral responses during natural infection. This is a key issue that will impact the management of the pandemic and determine the utility of seroconversion studies and the level of herd immunity. Certainly, several cases of reinfection have been reported, suggesting that immunity could be transient, as reported for other coronaviruses. In summary, although the kinetics of the generation of antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 and their protective activity have been clearly defined, their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the length of these responses are still open questions.

0	Structural basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spike glycoprotein plays a critical role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. It is also the major target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. This review summarizes recent studies on the structure and function of spike glycoprotein, which revealed the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection., RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding. Receptor binding and spike glycoprotein priming by host proteases such as furin and transmembrane protease serine 2 induce pre to postfusion conformational changes of the spike trimer that enable membrane fusion. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 were elucidated at atomic resolution using high-resolution crystal structures. These structures, together with adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains, further revealed critical residues of the spike glycoprotein for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission., SUMMARY: Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein provide important structural knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission.	false
0	Seasonal incidence of respiratory viral infections in Telangana, India: utility of a multiplex PCR assay to bridge the knowledge gap. Objective: The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. Method(s): A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. Result(s): Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. Conclusion(s): There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritised and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false
0	The development of a quarantine strategy is an important path to a normalized response to COVID-19. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still in a global pandemic that has affected more than 200 countries. When prevention and control of COVID-19 is gradually normalized, communication between countries needs to be gradually restored due to development needs. There are 34 vaccines in the clinical evaluation stage and 145 vaccines in the preclinical evaluation stage in the global COVID-19 vaccine research and development program, but the rate and process of vaccination may not be sufficient to meet the current needs of society for restoring development and communication. Studies have found that chloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir and other drugs are useful for COVID-19, but currently there is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The main detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 at present include pathogenic detection methods, molecular biology detection methods and antibody detection, of which molecular biology detection technology is the main detection method at present. There are some more convenient and rapid detection methods. A study showed that salivary nucleic acid testing could be used for large-scale screening of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results showed that the probability of true concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva was stubbornly 0.998 (90% CI: 0.996-0.999). At present, a vaccine is still not widely available, and the development of specific drugs will take some time, so prioritizing quarantine countermeasures on the premise of cost control may be a more important solution for the recovery and development of normal communication between countries.	false
0	BCG revaccination of health workers in Brazil to improve innate immune responses against COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Objectives: The BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiania (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. Trial design: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. Participant(s): The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiania - Goias, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. Intervention and comparator: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. Main outcomes: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. Randomisation: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. Blinding (masking): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated. Trial Status: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021. Trial registration: The protocol number was registered on August 5th, 2020 at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clinicos). Register number: RBR-4kjqtg and WHO trial registration number UTN: U1111-1256-3892. Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

0	Progress and Pitfalls in the Quest for Effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccines. There are currently around 200 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials throughout the world. The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical. Careful evaluation and ongoing surveillance for safety will be required to address theoretical concerns regarding immune enhancement seen in previous contexts. Herein, we review the current knowledge about the immune response to this novel virus as it pertains to the design of effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the range of novel and established approaches to vaccine development being taken. We provide details of some of the frontrunner vaccines and discuss potential issues including adverse effects, scale-up and delivery.© Copyright © 2020 Flanagan, Best, Crawford, Giles, Koirala, Macartney, Russell, Teh and Wen.	false
0	Prediction and mitigation of mutation threats to COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the raging COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, are prone to over 1,800 mutations uncovered by a Mutation Tracker. It is urgent to understand how vaccines and antibodies in the development would be impacted by mutations. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the spike (S) protein, which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development. We provide a strategy to prioritize the selection of mutations for designing vaccines or antibody cocktails.	false

0	Challenges of remote assessment in higher education in the context of COVID-19: a case study of Middle East College. Due to the unprecedented COVID-19 incident, higher education institutions have faced different challenges in their teaching-learning activities. Particularly conducting assessments remotely during COVID-19 has posed extraordinary challenges for higher education institutions owing to lack of preparation superimposed with the inherent problems of remote assessment. In the current study, the challenges of remote assessment during COVID-19 incident in higher education institutions were investigated taking Middle East College as a case study. For the study, questionnaires were prepared and data from 50 faculties were collected and analyzed. The study focused on the challenges of remote assessment in general and academic dishonesty in particular. The main challenges identified in remote assessment were academic dishonesty, infrastructure, coverage of learning outcomes, and commitment of students to submit assessments. To minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to each student was found to be the best approach. Online presentation was also found to be good option to control academic integrity violations. Combining various assessment methods, for instance report submission with online presentation, helps to minimize academic dishonesty since the examiner would have a chance to confirm whether the submitted work is the work of the student.

0	The relationship between psychological resilience, burnout, stress, and sociodemographic factors with depression in nurses and midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in Turkey. PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the relationship between psychological resilience, burnout, stress, and sociodemographic factors with depression in nurses and midwives during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic., DESIGN AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study included 377 midwives and nurses., RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in midwives and nurses in our sample was 31.8%. In the logistic regression analysis, the risk of depression in midwives was 1.92 times higher than that of nurses. A high perceived stress score increased the risk of depression by 1.16 times, and a high emotional exhaustion score increased the risk of depression by 1.11 times. A high psychological resilience score was found to be protective against depression (<0.001)., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results showed that one-third of midwives and nurses had symptoms of depression.

0	A Therapeutic Non-self-reactive SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Protects from Lung Pathology in a COVID-19 Hamster Model. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb, CV07-209, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 3.1 ng/mL. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 A revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss, and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy., Kreye et al. report isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, some of which were found to display autoreactivity with mammalian self-antigens in different organs. Crystal structures of two antibodies in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD reveal antibody engagement with the ACE2 binding site from different approach angles. One antibody was evaluated further for in vivo efficacy and found to be both protective and efficacious post-challenge in a hamster infection model.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	The utilization of rapid serological tests in COVID-19 diagnostics - a high risk of false-negative results in outpatient care, with particular emphasis on dental treatment. In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, in the early stages of the pandemic outbreak, postponing elective procedures was recommended all around the world. Outpatient care and dental care were limited to telephone advice and emergency services. Dental staff is particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 contraction, because of the inevitable contact with patients' body fluids during aerosol-generating procedures. The implementation of diagnostic tests among ambulatory patients could improve the occupational safety among outpatient care personnel. The aim of this review was to introduce information regarding COVID-19 diagnostics with a particular focus on the methods which can be utilized in an outpatient and dental care setting. An online PubMed database review of articles on COVID-19 diagnostics, published on February 12-May 15, 2020, was conducted. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnostics, which determines if a person has an active infection. Unfortunately, its utilization in outpatient care is limited. Serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identify people who were infected, including those who have had an asymptomatic infection, but they do not give sufficient information about the acute infection. Rapid serological assays developed to facilitate testing outside of laboratories, especially in dental offices, are not recommended by the World Health Organization to be used outside research settings, and they should not constitute the basis for clinical decision-making because of frequent false-negative results which may consequently contribute to personnel infections. Out of all available COVID-19 diagnostic methods, rapid serological assays seemed to be a method of choice in outpatient medical care. Unfortunately, their results turned out to be unreliable. The best methods to ensure the occupational safety of medical staff and to avoid cross-infections in outpatient care facilities include a thorough epidemiological interview, temperature measurement to rule out patients with an active infection, and the implementation of strict infection control procedures.

0	Tocilizumab use in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study. What is known and objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated cytokine activation can lead to a rapid progression into respiratory failure, shock and multiorgan failure. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that likely contributes to the pathogenesis of cytokine release syndrome. It is hypothesized that modulating IL-6 levels or its effects with tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, may alter the course of disease. Method(s): We examined the association between tocilizumab use and intubation or death at a community hospital in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results and Discussion: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study involving 1225 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the probability to respiratory failure, which was measured as intubation or death, was less frequent in patients who received tocilizumab. What is new and conclusion: Tocilizumab and other IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies may evolve as a viable option in treating patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false
0	Brainstem Dysfunction in SARS-COV-2 Infection can be a Potential Cause of Respiratory Distress. Background: A terrible pandemic, Covid-19, has captivated scientists to investigate if SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the central nervous system (CNS). A crucial question is if acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the main cause of death in this pandemic, and often refractory to treatments, can be explained by respiratory center dysfunction., Objective: To discuss that ARDS can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem., Materials and Methods: I reviewed literature about SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to infect the respiratory center in the brainstem., Results and Conclusions: An increasing amount of reports demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronavirus, which have been found in the brains of patients and experimental models, where the brainstem was severely infested. Recent studies have provided tremendous indication of the incidence of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brainstem. SARS-CoV-2 might infect the CNS through the olfactory bulb, spreading from the olfactory nerves to the rhinencephalon, and finally reaching the brainstem. Hence, the virus infection causes respiratory center dysfunctions, leading to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. I conclude that acute ARDS in Covid-19 can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion of brainstem respiratory center, suggesting the needs of more specific and aggressive treatments, with the direct participation of neurologists and neurointensivists.	false
0	"Comprehensive Literature Review and Evidence evaluation of Experimental Treatment in COVID 19 Contagion. Importance: Coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID 19) is caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) virus. The pandemic is affecting the livelihood of millions of people all over the world. At the time of preparing this report, the pandemic has affected 1 827 284 patients, with 113 031 deaths in 185 countries as per Johns Hopkins University. With no proven treatment for the disease, prevention of the disease in the community and healthcare setting is need of the hour. Objective(s): To perform a comprehensive literature search for preventive measures and experimental treatment options. In this review, we have focused our discussion on the risk of disease transmission, supportive treatment, and possible treatment options based on available evidence. Evidence Review: We performed a literature search on google scholar, PubMed, and society guidelines for literature related to COVID 19 and previous coronavirus pandemics. We included data review articles, observational studies, and controlled trials to synthesize the treatment options for COVID 19. Finding(s): In this article, we have extensively reviewed and discussed recommendations from various world organizations for the public and healthcare workers. We have also discussed currently available experimental treatments since there is no proven treatment for COVID 19. The best method of dealing with the current outbreak is to reduce the community spread and thus ""flatten the curve."" Although Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Azithromycin have been tried, passive immunity through convalescent serum and vaccine is still at an experimental stage. Patients with severe COVID 19 infections could be considered for this experimental treatment through various national randomized control trials, which may eventually lead to an evidence-based treatment strategy. Conclusions and Relevance: Awareness of currently available experimental treatment among healthcare providers and exploration of possible treatment options through evidence is need of the hour. We have discussed the most recently available literature and evidence behind experimental treatment in this article.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020."	false

0	What we know about covid-19 and its treatment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the human coronavirus and a member of the Coronaviridae family leads to fatal pneumonia cases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 attaches to the cells in the human body through binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the spike (S) protein. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 arised in China in late 2019 and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). The World Health Organization named the disease caused by this virus as corona virus disease (COVID)-19. SARS-CoV-2 which has human-to-human transmission through droplets, direct contact and aerosol routes have affected more than 10 million people and caused more than 500 thousand deaths. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, sore throat, respiratory distress, lung damage, and diarrhea. In severe cases, mechanical ventilation is required and multiple organ damage is encountered. COVID-19 is diagnosed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique which is applied to saliva and swab samples taken from the nose or nasal cavity. Lung damage is detected by computerized tomography (CT). COVID-19 develops more severely in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer. While vaccine and drug development studies are continuing all over the world, available antiviral drugs such as umifenovir, remdesivir, favipiravir are also tested against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the plasma donated from the recovered patients are tested for COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, treating the inflammatory conditions developing due to COVID-19 and applying antimicrobial drugs against co-infections are among the current approaches.Copyright © 2020 Marmara University Press.	false
0	Current Options in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Review. Novel Coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019 in China and spread rapidly all around the world infecting many people. To date, no specific vaccines and drugs have been developed for this disease. Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and high prevalence of the infected patients, the drugs and the therapies of other past viral epidemics have been used for this disease. Many studies have been performed on the specific treatments to find whether or not they are effective on COVID-19 patients. In this review, we collected information about the most widely used drugs to treat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) belonging to groups of antivirals, antibiotics, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. Some of these compounds and drugs were used directly by inpatients, so researchers have examined others in laboratory conditions. This study considered the pros and cons of using these treatments separately and together and compared their results. By studying this review, we hope to provide useful information for researchers.

0	Therapeutic options for COVID - 19: Pandemic - a review. Covid-19 is an outbreak of a severe acute respiratory disorder which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then the virus has spread to many countries and has become and pandemic. The mortality rate of the disease is very high but it varies from country to country depending on the medical facilities and the observance of isolation among the population. As the disease is very contagious many different treatment modalities have been tried. The therapeutic methods which are used are Ayurvedic and homeopathic along with that some Allopathic drugs are also used. Ayurvedic and home-opathy were found to be useful in asymptomatic patients rather than symp-tomatic patients. The drug which is used for treatment is antiviral drugs, pro-tease inhibitors, antimalarial drugs, and neuraminidase inhibitors. But most promising results were obtained by using hydroxychloroquine, thus many countries are using this drug for treatment. Research related to vaccine development is still in progress. but there is still an absence of data regarding the effectiveness of these methods. Clinical trials need to be performed to prove the drug or the measure effective. While the search for a vaccine is still under-way, preventive measures should be taken to curb the chain of infection. This includes the use of face mask, washing hands frequently, at least 1meter dis-tance while in public places. This Literature review summarizes all the measures that have been used for the treatment of COVID 19 pandemic all around the world.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a candidate vaccine antigen that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to virus entry. Here, it is shown that rapid conversion of recombinant RBD into particulate form via admixing with liposomes containing cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP) potently enhances the functional antibody response. Antigen binding via His-tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum-stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen-presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes. QS-21 inclusion in the liposomes results in an enhanced antigen-specific polyfunctional T cell response. In mice, high dose immunization results in minimal local reactogenicity, is well-tolerated, and does not elevate serum cobalt levels. Taken together, these results confirm that particulate presentation strategies for the RBD immunogen should be considered for inducing strongly neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2.

0	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Biosynthesis, Structure, Function, and Antigenicity: Implications for the Design of Spike-Based Vaccine Immunogens. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a grave threat to global public health and imposes a severe burden on the entire human society. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes spike (S) glycoproteins, which protrude from the surface of mature virions. The S glycoprotein plays essential roles in virus attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. Surface location of the S glycoprotein renders it a direct target for host immune responses, making it the main target of neutralizing antibodies. In the light of its crucial roles in viral infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein is the focus of most vaccine strategies as well as therapeutic interventions. In this review, we highlight and describe the recent progress that has been made in the biosynthesis, structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, aiming to provide valuable insights into the design and development of the S protein-based vaccines as well as therapeutics.© Copyright © 2020 Duan, Zheng, Zhang, Niu, Lou and Wang.	false
0	"Is ""no test is better than a bad test""? Impact of diagnostic uncertainty in mass testing on the spread of COVID-19. Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle epidemics. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus."	false

0	Effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on protein structures and intraviral protein-protein interactions. Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all >=1% as of September 1st, 2020, then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD >=5.0 A), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-S and Orf3a-Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations could change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby might have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

0	Immune Correlates of COVID-19 Control. COVID-19 caused by SARS CoV2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and soon become a pandemic. Since the virus is novel, pre-existing CoV2-specific immunity is not expected to exist in humans, although studies have shown presence of CoV2 cross-reactive T cells in unexposed individuals. Lack of effective immunity in most individuals along with high infectiousness of the virus has resulted in massive global public health emergency. Intense efforts are on to study viral pathogenesis and immune response to help guide prophylactic and therapeutic interventions as well as epidemiological assessments like transmission modeling. To develop an effective vaccine or biologic therapeutic, it is critical to understand the immune correlates of COVID-19 control. At the same time, whether immunity in recovered individuals is effective for preventing re-infection will be important for informing interventions like social distancing. Key questions that are being investigated regarding immune response in COVID-19 which will help these efforts include, investigations of immune response that distinguishes patients with severe versus mild infection or those that recover relative to those that succumb, durability of immunity in recovered patients and relevance of developed immunity in a cured patient for protection against re-infection as well as value of convalescent plasma from recovered patients as a potential therapeutic modality. This is a broad and rapidly evolving area and multiple reports on status of innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV2 are emerging on a daily basis. While many questions remain unanswered for now, the purpose of this focused review is to summarize the current understanding regarding immune correlates of COVID-19 severity and resolution in order to assist researchers in the field to pursue new directions in prevention and control.© Copyright © 2020 Poonia and Kottilil.	false
0	"The Determinants of Conspiracy Beliefs Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Nationally Representative Sample of Internet Users. An overwhelming flood of misinformation is accompanying the pandemic of COVID-19. Fake news and conspiracy theories are so prevalent that the World Health Organization started as early as February 2020 to use the term ""infodemic"". This paper is focused on the assessment of the prevalence of beliefs in conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 in Polish society. The association of support for conspiracy theories with sociodemographic variables, health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (eHL) was studied. The analysis reported here was based on the data from an online survey of a representative sample (n = 1002) of the adult population of Polish Internet users. The multivariate linear regression for the COVID-19-related conspiracy belief score (CCBS) and logistic regression models for the support of individual conspiracy theories was developed. The percentage of supporters of particular conspiracy theories in the study sample ranged from 43% to 56%. The CCBS was significantly associated with age, education level, vocational status and both HL and eHL. However, it was lower for persons with higher HL (regression coefficient (B) = -0.04, p < 0.001) but higher for those with higher eHL (B = 0.04, p = 0.038). The most influential predictors of CCBS were age (standardised regression coefficient (beta) = -0.21) and education level (beta from 0.08 to 0.16 for respondents with lower education levels and those with master's degrees). In conclusion, younger persons rather than older, those with a lower rather than with a higher level of education, employees rather than students and persons with lower rather than higher HL were more likely to believe the conspiracy theories. Surprisingly, contrary to expectations, higher eHL was significantly associated with greater belief in such theories."	false
0	Shorter incubation period is associated with severe disease progression in patients with COVID-19. The diagnosed COVID-19 cases revealed that the incubation periods (IP) varied a lot among patients. However, few studies had emphasized on the different clinical features and prognosis of patients with different IP. A total of 330 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and classified into immediate onset group(IP<3 days, I group, 57 cases) and late onset group(IP>10 days, L group, 75 cases) based on IP. The difference of clinical characteristics and prognosis of the two groups were compared. There were more patients with fever in I group than in L group(P = 0.003), and counts of all the total lymphocytes, total T lymphocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes were significantly different between the two groups(all P < 0.01). Besides, patients in L group had more GGOs in CT scan than I group and there were more patients in I group receiving antibiotic treatment than in L group(P < 0.001). For disease aggravation, the median CT scores were comparable between the two groups, but individually, there were more patients with increased CT score during hospitalization in I group than in L group. The aggravation incidence of CT presentation was 21.1% in I group, significantly higher than L group(8.0%, P = 0.042). Multivariable COX models suggested that IP was the only independent factors for CT aggravation. Conclusively, patients with different IP were different in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and CT presentations. Shorter IP was associated with the aggravation of lung involvement in CT scan.	false
0	The importance of overweight in COVID-19: A retrospective analysis in a single center of Wuhan, China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between overweight and severity, drug response, and clinical outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed medical records of 240 COVID-19 patients admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between December 24, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Physical, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome data were abstracted. Patients who were obese [body mass index (BMI) >=28 kg/m], underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m), under 18 years old, pregnant, or still in hospital were excluded. Disease severity was classified as moderate or severe pneumonia based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. Overweight was defined as BMI >=24 kg/m and <28 kg/m. Patients were followed for discharge or death through April 10, 2020. We used logistic regression models to identify risk factors for severe disease, Cox proportional hazard models to explore associations between medications and patient outcomes (discharge or in-hospital death), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital death.One-half of patients (120, 50.0%) had severe pneumonia, while nearly one-half (114, 47.5%) were overweight. Among patients over 45 years old, overweight patients had significantly lower rates of fatigue, higher rates of headache, and higher median C-reactive protein levels. Patients under 45 years old had higher rates of cough and myalgia and higher proportions of increased alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase, as well as more pulmonary lobes involved in the pneumonia revealed by chest computed tomography scans. Overweight patients were at higher risk of developing severe pneumonia. Although weight was not a risk factor for in-hospital death, overweight patients showed different responses to medications compared with normal weight patients. Intravenous interferon-alpha, intravenous glucocorticoids, and antifungal drugs were associated with reduced mortality in overweight patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin, oseltamivir, and ribavirin were associated with reduced mortality in normal weight patients.Overweight is a worldwide health problem. We found overweight to be related to the COVID-19 severity but not to in-hospital death. Clinicians should be aware that overweight COVID-19 patients require increased attention for different clinical features and treatment response.	false
0	Modeling latent infection transmissions through biosocial stochastic dynamics. The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.	false

With the exponentially growing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, clinicians continue to seek accurate and rapid diagnosis methods in addition to virus and antibody testing modalities. Because radiographs such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are cost-effective and widely available at public health facilities, hospital emergency rooms (ERs), and even at rural clinics, they could be used for rapid detection of possible COVID-19-induced lung infections. Therefore, toward automating the COVID-19 detection, in this paper, we propose a viable and efficient deep learning-based chest radiograph classification (DL-CRC) framework to distinguish the COVID-19 cases with high accuracy from other abnormal (e.g., pneumonia) and normal cases. A unique dataset is prepared from four publicly available sources containing the posteroanterior (PA) chest view of X-ray data for COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases. Our proposed DL-CRC framework leverages a data augmentation of radiograph images (DARI) algorithm for the COVID-19 data by adaptively employing the generative adversarial network (GAN) and generic data augmentation methods to generate synthetic COVID-19 infected chest X-ray images to train a robust model. The training data consisting of actual and synthetic chest X-ray images are fed into our customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model in DL-CRC, which achieves COVID-19 detection accuracy of 93.94% compared to 54.55% for the scenario without data augmentation (i.e., when only a few actual COVID-19 chest X-ray image samples are available in the original dataset). Furthermore, we justify our customized CNN model by extensively comparing it with widely adopted CNN architectures in the literature, namely ResNet, Inception-ResNet v2, and DenseNet that represent depth-based, multi-path-based, and hybrid CNN paradigms. The encouragingly high classification accuracy of our proposal implies that it can efficiently automate COVID-19 detection from radiograph images to provide a fast and reliable evidence of COVID-19 infection in the lung that can complement existing COVID-19 diagnostics modalities.	false
0	Estimated Association of Construction Work With Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Hospitalization in Texas. Importance: Policy makers have relaxed restrictions for certain nonessential industries, including construction, jeopardizing the effectiveness of social distancing measures and putting already at-risk populations at greater risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In Texas, Latinx populations are overly represented among construction workers, and thus have elevated rates of exposure that are compounded by prevalent high-risk comorbidities and lack of access to health care., Objective: To assess the association between construction work during the COVID-19 pandemic and hospitalization rates for construction workers and the surrounding community., Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model used a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, stratified by age and risk group, with construction workers modeled explicitly. The model was based on residents of the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, with a population of 2.17 million. Based on 500 stochastic simulations for each of 15 scenarios that varied the size of the construction workforce and level of worksite transmission risk, the association between continued construction work and hospitalizations was estimated and then compared with anonymized line-list hospitalization data from central Texas through August 20, 2020., Exposures: Social distancing interventions, size of construction workforce, and level of disease transmission at construction worksites., Main Outcomes and Measures: For each scenario, the total number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and the relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers was projected and then compared with relative risks estimated from reported hospitalization data., Results: Allowing unrestricted construction work was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalization rates through mid-August 2020 from 0.38 per 1000 residents to 1.5 per 1000 residents and from 0.22 per 1000 construction workers to 9.3 per 1000 construction workers. This increased risk was estimated to be offset by safety measures (such as thorough cleaning of equipment between uses, wearing of protective equipment, limits on the number of workers at a worksite, and increased health surveillance) that were associated with a 50% decrease in transmission. The observed relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers compared with other occupational categories among adults aged 18 to 64 years was 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2)., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that unrestricted work in high-contact industries, such as construction, is associated with a higher level of community transmission, increased risks to at-risk workers, and larger health disparities among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.	false
0	Gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal nucleic acid testing of children with 2019 coronavirus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In order to understand the clinical manifestations and incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children and discuss the importance of fecal nucleic acid testing.We retrospectively analyzed studies on gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal nucleic acid detection in pediatric COVID-19 patients from January 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020, including prospective clinical studies and case reports. The results of fecal nucleic acid detection were analyzed systematically. Stata12.0 software was used for meta-analysis.The results showed that the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in children with COVID-19 were vomiting and diarrhea, with a total incidence of 17.7% (95% Cl 13.9-21.5%). However, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in other countries (21.1%, 95% CI 16.5-25.7%) was higher compared to China (12.9%, 95% CI 8-17.7%). In Wuhan, the pooled prevalence was much higher (41.3%, 95% CI 3.2-79.4%) compared to areas outside Wuhan in China (7.1%, 95% CI 4.0-10.3%). The positive rate of fecal nucleic acid testing in COVID-19 children was relatively high at 85.8% (91/106). Additionally, 71.2% (52/73) were still positive for fecal nucleic acid after respiratory tract specimens turned negative. One and two weeks after the respiratory tract specimens turned nucleic acid-negative, 45.2% (33/73) and 34.2% (25/73) patients, respectively, remained fecal nucleic acid-positive. The longest interval between the respiratory tract specimens turning negative and fecal specimens turning negative exceeded 70 days. Conclusions and relevance: gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are relatively common. Attention should be paid to the detection of fecal nucleic acids in children. Fecal nucleic acid-negative status should be considered as one of the desegregation standards.	false
0	Prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and Its Associated Unfavorable Outcomes in Patients With Acute Respiratory Syndromes Due to Coronaviruses Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Introduction: Only 3 types of coronavirus cause aggressive respiratory disease in humans (MERS-Cov, SARS-Cov-1, and SARS-Cov-2). It has been reported higher infection rates and severe manifestations (ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death) in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM). For this reason, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetes comorbidity and its associated unfavorable health outcomes in patients with acute respiratory syndromes for coronavirus disease according to virus types. Method(s): Systematic review of literature in Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scielo until April of 2020. We included cohort and cross-sectional studies with no restriction by language or geographical zone. The selection and extraction were undertaken by 2 reviewers, independently. The study quality was evaluated with Loney's instrument and data were synthesized by random effects model meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was quantified using an I2 statistic. Funnel plot, Egger, and Begg tests were used to evaluate publication biases, and subgroups and sensitivity analyses were performed. Finally, we used the GRADE approach to assess the evidence certainty (PROSPERO: CRD42020178049). Result(s): We conducted the pooled analysis of 28 studies (n = 5960). The prevalence analysis according to virus type were 451.9 diabetes cases per 1000 infected patients (95% CI: 356.74-548.78; I2 = 89.71%) in MERS-Cov; 90.38 per 1000 (95% CI: 67.17-118.38) in SARS-Cov-1; and 100.42 per 1000 (95% CI: 77.85, 125.26 I2 = 67.94%) in SARS-Cov-2. The mortality rate were 36%, 6%, 10% and for MERS-Cov, SARS-Cov-1, and SARS-Cov-2, respectively. Due to the high risk of bias (75% of studies had very low quality), high heterogeneity (I2 higher than 60%), and publication bias (for MERS-Cov studies), we down rate the certainty to very low. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of DM in patients with acute respiratory syndrome due to coronaviruses is high, predominantly with MERS-Cov infection. The unfavorable health outcomes are frequent in this subset of patients. Well-powered and population-based studies are needed, including detailed DM clinical profile (such as glycemic control, DM complications, and treatment regimens), comorbidities, and SARS-Cov-2 evolution to reevaluate the worldwide prevalence of this comorbidity and to typify clinical phenotypes with differential risk within the subpopulation of DM patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Ocular manifestation, comorbidities, and detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 from conjunctiva in coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic has presented major challenges to ophthalmologists. Reports have shown that ocular manifestations can be the first presenting symptoms of COVID 19 infection and conjunctiva may be a portal of entry for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The purpose of this article is to provide general guidance for ophthalmologists to understand the prevalence of ocular presentation in COVID 19 patients and to reduce the risk of transmission during practice. Relevant studies published in the period of November 1, 2019, and July 15, 2020, regarding ocular manifestations of COVID 19 and detection of SARS CoV 2 in the eye were included in this systematic review and meta analysis. The pooled prevalence of the ocular manifestations has been estimated at 7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.10) among COVID 19 patients. The pooled detection rate of SARS CoV 2 from conjunctiva was low (1%, 95% CI: 0.00-0.03). Conjunctival symptoms were the most common ocular manifestations in COVID 19, but the positive detection rate of the SARS CoV 2 virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of conjunctival tears or secretions remained low. No study has shown a definite transmission of COVID 19 through ocular mucosa or secretions. In summary, ocular manifestations in COVID 19 patients commonly comprise ocular surface symptoms. Although a low prevalence of ocular symptoms was encountered among patients infected by SARS CoV 2, it is imperative for all ophthalmologists to understand the full spectrum of COVID 19 symptoms or signs including those of the eyes as well as to adopt appropriate protective measures during clinical practice.

0	The Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Symptoms, Abnormal Liver Function, Digestive System Disease and Liver Disease in COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 infected millions of people. Some patients had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease and liver disease., AIM: To investigate the prevalence of GI symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease and liver disease in patients with COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: We searched PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, and 2 Chinese databases. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of GI symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease, and liver disease. Different studies were included in different subset analysis. These outcomes were estimated with proportions, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value by Stata SE 15.1., RESULTS: Thirty-one studies involving 4682 patients were included. The most significant GI symptoms were diarrhea (0.08, 95% CI: 0.06-0.11) and anorexia (0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.27). The most significant abnormal liver function was increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (0.25, 95% CI: 0.16-0.33). A total of 5% of the patients had digestive system disease (95% CI: 0.02-0.08). A total of 3% of the patients had liver disease (95% CI: 0.02-0.05). The prevalence of nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease, and liver disease was higher in Wuhan group. The prevalence of diarrhea was higher in non-China group. Patients in severe/intensive care unit group were more likely to have diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased ALT., CONCLUSION: The most significant GI symptoms were anorexia and diarrhea. The most significant abnormal liver function was increased ALT. Severe patients were more likely to have GI symptoms and abnormal liver function.	false
0	Effects of underlying morbidities on the occurrence of deaths in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most hectic pandemic of the era, is increasing exponentially and taking thousands of lives worldwide. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity., Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found., Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69)., Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.

0	Systematic Review on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: It Is Time to Take Stock. Background & Aims: Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes. Conclusion(s): Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute	false
0	Prevalence of liver injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) : a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a public health emergency of international concern, causing thousands of deaths worldwide. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis., RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-induced liver injury must not be ignored, as it is observed in one fifth of infected patients. Pro- spective studies evaluating liver function during the course of COVID-19 are needed to provide a complete overview of hepatic involvement during this viral infection.

0	Cerebral Venous Thrombosis in Patients with COVID-19 Infection: a Case Series and Systematic Review. Background: There has been increasing reports associating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with thromboembolic phenomenon including ischemic strokes and venous thromboembolism. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that has been observed in some COVID-19 patients, yet much remains to be learnt of its underlying pathophysiology. Objective(s): We present a case series of local patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT; and aim to perform a systematic review of known cases in the current literature. Method(s): We describe two patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT from a nationwide registry in Singapore. We then conducted a literature search in PubMed and Embase using a suitable keyword search strategy from 1st December 2019 to 11th June 2020. All studies reporting CVT in COVID-19 patients were included. Result(s): Nine studies and 14 COVID-19 patients with CVT were studied. The median age was 43 years (IQR=36-58) and majority had no significant past medical conditions (60.0%). The time taken from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVT diagnosis was a median of 7 days (IQR=6-14). CVT was commonly seen in the transverse (75.0%) and sigmoid sinus (50.0%); 33.3% had involvement of the deep venous sinus system. A significant proportion of patients had raised D-dimer (75.0%) and CRP levels (50.0%). Two patients reported presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Most patients received anticoagulation (91.7%) while overall mortality rate was 45.5%. Conclusion(s): The high mortality rate of CVT in COVID-19 infection warrants a high index of suspicion from physicians, and early treatment with anticoagulation should be initiated.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical activity of Pediatric Urology: analysis of postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic of global impact that forced social-political measures to be taken, such as the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain. At the same time, the reorganization of the pediatric medical-surgical activities and infrastructures was carried out, with the consequent suspension of the non-urgent surgical activity of Pediatric Urology. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity in a Pediatric Urology division, as well as surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and surgical data was carried out, including complications and readmissions of all patients operated on in the division of Pediatric Urology within the duration of the state of alarm. Five time periods have been created according to the de-escalation phases., RESULTS: Forty-nine surgical procedures were carried out on 45 patients (8 prior to the implementation of the de-escalation phases). High priority pathologies were the most frequent in the first phases, being the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction the most prevalent. Four complications were recorded (8.8%), none of them were respiratory., CONCLUSIONS: The EAU recommendations for the resumption of surgical activity have allowed a correct, safe and gradual transition to the routine surgical activity in Pediatric Urology. The Clavien-Dindo classification is useful and valid for application in this division. No respiratory complications have been reported that could be attributable to the pandemic situation.

0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial health and well-being in South-Asian (World Psychiatric Association zone 16) countries: A systematic and advocacy review from the Indian Psychiatric Society. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat. The South-Asian (SA) countries have witnessed both the initial brunt of the outbreak as well as the ongoing rise of cases. Their unique challenges in relation to mental health during the pandemic are worth exploring. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic review was conducted for all the original studies on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on psychological health/well-being in the SA countries of the World Psychiatric Association Zone 16. PubMed, Google Scholar, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched till June 2020. Studies conducted in the age group of 18-60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. Result(s): Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility. Conclusion(s): The ongoing COVID-19 crisis and its impact serve as an important period for adequate mental healthcare, promotion, research, and holistic biopsychosocial management of psychiatric disorders, especially in vulnerable groups. Mental healthcare and research strategies during the pandemic and preparedness for postpandemic aftermath are advocated subsequently.

0	Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several published reports have described a possible association between Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This systematic review aimed to summarize and meta-analyze the salient features and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS., METHODS: We searched the PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and Cochrane databases for articles published between January 1st and August 5th 2020 using SARS-CoV-2 and GBS-related keywords. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, antecedent symptoms, clinical, serological and electrophysiological features, and hospital outcomes were recorded., RESULTS: We included 45 articles from 16 countries reporting 61 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. Most (97.7%) articles were from high- and upper-middle-income countries. Forty-two (68.9%) of the patients were male; median (interquartile range) age was 57 (49-70) years. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 90.2% of patients. One report of SARS-CoV-2-associated familial GBS was found which affected a father and daughter of a family. Albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid was found in 80.8% of patients. The majority of patients (75.5%) had a demyelinating subtype of GBS. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis were given to 92.7% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. Around two-thirds (65.3%) of patients had a good outcome (GBS-disability score <= 2) on discharge from hospital. Two patients died in hospital., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS mostly resembles the classical presentations of GBS that respond to standard treatments. Extensive surveillance is required in low- and lower-middle-income countries to identify and report similar cases/series. Further large-scale case-control studies are warranted to strengthen the current evidence. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Pulmonary vascular enlargement on thoracic CT for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. To date, although many studies have reported on the computed tomography (CT) manifestations of COVID-19, the vascular enlargement sign (VES) of COVID-19 has not been deeply examined, with the few available studies reporting an inconsistent prevalence. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the best available studies to estimate the prevalence and identify the underlying differential diagnostic value of VES. Method(s): We searched nine English and Chinese language databases up to April 23, 2020. Studies that evaluated CT features of COVID-19 patients and reported VES, with or without comparison with other pneumonia were included. The methodologic quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Meta-analyses with random effects models were performed to calculate the aggregate prevalence and pooled odds ratios (ORs) of VES. We also conducted meta-regression and subgroup analyses to analyze heterogeneity. Result(s): VES findings from a total of 1969 patients were summarized and pooled across 22 studies. Our analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of VES among COVID-19 patients was 69.37% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57.40-79.20%]. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, VES manifestation was more frequently observed in confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR =6.43, 95% CI: 3.39-12.22). Studies that explicitly defined distribution of VES in the lesion area demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence (P=0.03). Subgroup analyses also revealed a relatively higher VES rate in studies with a sample size larger than 50, but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant difference in VES rates was found between different countries (China/Italy), regions (Hubei/outside Hubei), average age groups (over/less than 50-year-old), or slice thicknesses of CT scan. Extensive heterogeneity was identified across most estimates (I2>80%). Some of the variations (R2=19.73%) could be explained by VES distribution, and sample size. No significant publication bias was seen (P=0.29). Conclusion(s): VES on thoracic CT was found in almost two-thirds of COVID-19 patients, and was more prevalent compared with that of the non-COVID-19 patients, supporting a promising role for VES in identifying pneumonia caused by coronavirus.Copyright © 2020 AME Publishing Company.

0	A critical review of outcomes of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has created an alarming fear, apprehension, and worry world over. Cancer patients represent a subgroup that is vulnerable and is under high risk. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze factors that predict outcomes in these patients so that they can be triaged accordingly in order to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on cancer management. To determine the factors affecting cancer patients in COVID-19. A systematic search was performed to identify all relevant studies on PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar published until April 5, 2020. Relevant articles that reported the incidence, demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of cancer patients infected by COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Among 559 articles that were further screened, 14 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of cancer across various studies ranged from 0.5% to 2.43%. Males were more than females, and the mean age affected was 63.1-66 years. Lung cancer was the most common subtype (25%-58.3%). Cancer patients, as reported, had a higher risk of progressing to severe events (hazard ratio:3.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.65-7.69; P < 0.0001). Nearly 39%-53.6% of patients who had a recent history of anticancer therapy developed severe events. Individuals with cancer feared the risk of complications. Cancer patients have worse outcomes from COVID-19, compared to the general population, providing a reason to pay more timely attention. High-risk patients should have vigorous screening and intensive surveillance. Anticancer treatment during COVID-19 should be modified based on the type and prognosis of cancer.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	"Cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 in 458 confirmed cases: A systematic review. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the whole world for a short span of time. As it is a novel virus, its manifestations have been slowly revealed. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have gradually been reported from different regions of the world. However, their significance in diagnosis, as well as predicting prognosis, remains to be established., Objective: This review describes the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 patients from diverse regions with the aim of highlighting any important associations., Methods: A literature search was conducted using ""PubMed"" for original articles, case series, and case reports using the search terms ""cutaneous manifestations"" and ""skin manifestations"" in combination with ""COVID-19"" published up to 31 May., Results: Nine original research articles and 35 case series or case reports were identified, including 458 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ratio of male to female patients was 0.94, and the patients' age ranged from 2 months to 84 years. In 10% of cases, skin lesions appeared before systemic manifestations. The most common cutaneous manifestation was macular/maculo-papular rash (42.5%), followed by acute urticaria (17.9%), vesicular rash (15.3%), pseudo-chilblain or acral purpuric lesions (15.1), and livedo-reticularis (4.4%). The majority of reported cases were located in Spain, Italy, and France. These manifestations do not seem to be sex-, age-, or country-specific., Conclusion: It is necessary to conduct worldwide registries and prospective studies to assess the true incidence of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 and to streamline their categorization based on their pathogenesis. There appears to be no specific manifestation at present, but a high index of suspicion can help in the diagnosis of patients presenting with cutaneous lesions as the first manifestation.

0	Early epidemiological indicators, outcomes, and interventions of COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review. Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that brought the whole world to a standstill, has led to financial and health care burden. We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease., Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination., Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed., Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.

0	Missed takes towards a pandemic of COVID-19? A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan. Pakistan is also seeing the profound effect of the outbreak of COVID-19, which demands an urgent investigation of literature and further scientific investigation for cure and prevention. This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19. In particular to Pakistan, and in general, for other developing countries, a weak health-care system coupled with the trembling economy has many implications of COVID-19 which should be carefully thought-out to combat the spread.Copyright © 2020 Haq et al.

0	Acute Ischemic Stroke in COVID-19: A Case-Based Systematic Review. Corona virus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is recognized as a global pandemic by WHO 2020 with 5,934 936 infections, 367,166 deaths and affecting over 200 countries as of 30th May 2020. Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) in brain is also emerging as an important neurovascular/neurological complication of COVID-19, associated with extreme immune responses leading to dysregulated coagulation system and generalized thrombo-embolic status and increased risk of AIS especially among usually less vulnerable younger adults in this cohort. Thus, in early June 2020, we aimed to review the clinical data on all published cases of COVID-19 and concomitant AIS, with a view to understanding the pertinent clinical, laboratory and imaging features. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at time of hospital admission for COVID infection correlates positively with the duration of time before onset of clinical features of AIS. Higher NLR, C-Reactive protein, serum ferritin, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are associated with poor prognosis of AIS in COVID-19 with 75% of patients dying or being severely disabled at present. Currently it is too early to comment on the long-term outcomes for survivors. Copyright © 2020 Wijeratne, Sales, Karimi and Crewther.	false
0	High rates of pulmonary artery occlusions in COVID-19. A meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 patients are considered at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The real nature of pulmonary artery occlusions (PAO) in COVID-19 has been questioned, suggesting that it is caused also by in situ thrombi, rather than only by emboli (PE) from peripheral thrombi. METHOD(S): We searched MEDLINE for studies published until June 6th , 2020 that included COVID-19 patients or non-COVID-19 medical patients at VTE risk, treated with heparins, in whom VTE (PE and deep vein thrombosis, DVT) had been reported. Systematic review and results reporting were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Data were independently extracted by two observers and estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULT(S): We identified 17 studies including 3,224 COVID-19 patients and 7 including 11,985 non-COVID-19 patients. Two analyses were performed: in all COVID-19 patients and only in those (n=515) who, like non-COVID-19 patients, were screened systematically for DVT. The latter analysis revealed that the prevalence of DVT was 15.43% (95%CI,4.08-31.77) in COVID-19 and 4.21% (2.27-6.68) in non-COVID-19 patients (p=0.0482). The prevalence of PE was 4.85% (40.33-13.01) in COVID-19 patients and 0.22% (0.03-0.55) in non-COVID-19 patients (p=0.0128). The percentage of PE among VTE events was 22.15% (5.31-44.60) in COVID-19 and 6.39% (3.17-10.41) in non-COVID-19 patients (p=0.0482). Differences were even more marked when all COVID-19 patients were analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): The results of our meta-analysis highlight a disproportion in the prevalence of PE among all VTE events in COVID 19 patients, likely reflecting PAO by pulmonary thrombi, rather than emboli from peripheral vein thrombi.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review of molecular diagnostic tools including sample collection and commercial response with associated advantages and limitations. The unprecedented global pandemic known as SARS-CoV-2 has exercised to its limits nearly all aspects of modern viral diagnostics. In doing so, it has illuminated both the advantages and limitations of current technologies. Tremendous effort has been put forth to expand our capacity to diagnose this deadly virus. In this work, we put forth key observations in the functionality of current methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. These methods include nucleic acid amplification-, CRISPR-, sequencing-, antigen-, and antibody-based detection methods. Additionally, we include analysis of equally critical aspects of COVID-19 diagnostics, including sample collection and preparation, testing models, and commercial response. We emphasize the integrated nature of assays, wherein issues in sample collection and preparation could impact the overall performance in a clinical setting.	false

0	COVID-19, the Swedish 'Experiment', and Me. In this personal vision paper the Swedish approach to COVID-19 prompts an exploration of how and why assuming individual rationality coupled with minimal social restriction may be as good a solution as any and better than most. A COVID sub-model is developed and populated with probabilities for four outcomes of infecting another person (asymptomatic, sick, hospitalized, dead), conditional on three observable characteristics (sex, age, and BMI), and (dis)utilities for three categories of person (nearest/dearest, friends/colleagues and unknown others) experiencing those outcomes. The implications for a liberal democracy are drawn, based on the assumptions that individual citizens will and should maximise their informed expected utility, exhibiting 'commons sense' as well as common sense.	false
0	State-wise prevalence of COVID 19 in India by using machine learning approaches. Coronavirus is one of the world's most critical issues, till date. Comprehension of causative variables such as mellitus, heart-related issues, asthma, blood pressure, etc., including the intrinsic transmission mechanisms of the disease, COVID 19 and its eradication are important for neurological investigation. Hence, the advance of appropriate modeling approaches and methods applied to current corona information on the pervasiveness of the pandemic and other serious illness aspects, is taking consideration. The prevalence of COVID 19 in India has reached epidemic proportions, and this disease is becoming a significantly increasing case in India. In this work, polynomial regression analysis methods employ to to forecast the number of COVID 19 corona patients. In this, we described a decision tree, polynomial and random forest classification of disease in COVID 19 incidences modelling and forecasting in India and a predicted prevalence of high level of confidence.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Acute Respiratory Distress in Aged, SARS-CoV-2 Infected African Green Monkeys but not Rhesus Macaques. SARS-CoV-2 induces a wide range of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a life-threating illness, particularly in the elderly and persons with comorbid conditions. Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. Here we report ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found dramatic increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All of the AGMs showed increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared to baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results show that both RM and AGM are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations including ARDS.

0	Impact of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases on the severity of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. We examined the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension and diabetes on the development of severe COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive, systematic literature search for studies published between December 2019 and July 5, 2020 in five databases. The prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes was evaluated through a meta-analysis. Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results. Our findings suggest patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes are at greater risk for developing severe COVID-19 than those without these conditions.	false
0	Identifying the measurements required to estimate rates of COVID-19 transmission, infection, and detection, using variational data assimilation. We demonstrate the ability of statistical data assimilation (SDA) to identify the measurements required for accurate state and parameter estimation in an epidemiological model for the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission in a tertiary hospital and assessment of the effects of different intervention strategies. Novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2) can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals, cruise ships, prisons, and places of worship. In particular, a healthcare-associated outbreak could become the epicenter of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intervention strategies on the hospital outbreak within a tertiary hospital. A mathematical model was developed for the COVID-19 transmission within a 2500-bed tertiary hospital of South Korea. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model with a compartment of doctor, nurse, patient, and caregiver was constructed. The effects of different intervention strategies such as front door screening, quarantine unit for newly admitted patients, early testing of suspected infected people, and personal protective equipment for both medical staff and visitors were evaluated. The model suggested that the early testing (within eight hours) of infected cases and monitoring the quarantine ward for newly hospitalized patients are effective measures for decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital (81.3% and 70% decrease of number of incident cases, respectively, during 60 days). Front door screening for detecting suspected cases had only 42% effectiveness. Screening for prohibiting the admission of COVID-19 patients was more effective than the measures for patients before emergency room or outpatient clinic. This model suggests that under the assumed conditions, some effective measures have a great influence on the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital. The implementation of the preventive measures could reduce the size of a hospital outbreak.	false

Peptide binding to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) is a central component of the immune system, and understanding the mechanism behind stable peptide-MHC binding will aid the development of immunotherapies. While MHC binding is mostly influenced by the identity of the so-called anchor positions of the peptide, secondary interactions from nonanchor positions are known to play a role in complex stability. However, current MHC-binding prediction methods lack an analysis of the major conformational states and might underestimate the impact of secondary interactions. In this work, we present an atomically detailed analysis of peptide-MHC binding that can reveal the contributions of any interaction toward stability. We propose a simulation framework that uses both umbrella sampling and adaptive sampling to generate a Markov state model (MSM) for a coronavirus-derived peptide (QFKDNVILL), bound to one of the most prevalent MHC receptors in humans (HLA-A24:02). While our model reaffirms the importance of the anchor positions of the peptide in establishing stable interactions, our model also reveals the underestimated importance of position 4 (p4), a nonanchor position. We confirmed our results by simulating the impact of specific peptide mutations and validated these predictions through competitive binding assays. By comparing the MSM of the wild-type system with those of the D4A and D4P mutations, our modeling reveals stark differences in unbinding pathways. The analysis presented here can be applied to any peptide-MHC complex of interest with a structural model as input, representing an important step toward comprehensive modeling of the MHC class I pathway.	false
0	Evaluating the plausible application of advanced machine learnings in exploring determinant factors of present pandemic: A case for continent specific COVID-19 analysis. Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	A discrete-time-evolution model to forecast progress of Covid-19 outbreak. Here we present a discrete-time-evolution model with one day interval to forecast the propagation of Covid-19. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.	false
0	Protection against SARS-CoV-2 by BCG vaccination is not supported by epidemiological analyses. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases. BCG vaccination has recently been proposed as a strategy to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, supported by its potential to boost innate immunity and initial epidemiological analyses which observed reduced severity of COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccination policies. Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our epidemiological findings do not provide evidence to correlate overall BCG vaccination policy with the spread of CoV-2 and its associated mortality.	false
0	Exploring the out of sight antigens of SARS-CoV-2 to design a candidate multi-epitope vaccine by utilizing immunoinformatics approaches. SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Currently, global health is facing its devastating outbreak. However, there is no vaccine available against this virus up to now. In this study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed to provoke both innate and adaptive immune responses. The immunodominant regions of six non-structural proteins (nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp14) of SARS-CoV-2 were selected by multiple immunoinformatic tools to provoke T cell immune response. Also, immunodominant fragment of the functional region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (400-510 residues) protein was selected for inducing neutralizing antibodies production. The selected regions' sequences were connected to each other by furin-sensitive linker (RVRR). Moreover, the functional region of beta-defensin as a well-known agonist for the TLR-4/MD complex was added at the N-terminus of the vaccine using (EAAAK)3 linker. Also, a CD4 + T-helper epitope, PADRE, was used at the C-terminal of the vaccine by GPGPG and A(EAAAK)2A linkers to form the final vaccine construct. The physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity, functionality and population coverage of the final vaccine construct were analyzed. The final vaccine construct was an immunogenic, non-allergen and unfunctional protein which contained multiple CD8 + and CD4 + overlapping epitopes, IFN-gamma inducing epitopes, linear and conformational B cell epitopes. It could form stable and significant interactions with TLR-4/MD according to molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Global population coverage of the vaccine for HLA-I and II were estimated 96.2% and 97.1%, respectively. At last, the final vaccine construct was reverse translated to design the DNA vaccine. Although the designed vaccine exhibited high efficacy in silico, further experimental validation is necessary.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false

Immunization has been described as a ""global health and development success story,"" and worldwide is estimated to prevent 2-3 million deaths annually.* In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends vaccination against 14 potentially serious illnesses by the time a child reaches age 24 months (1). CDC monitors coverage with ACIP-recommended vaccines through the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child); data from the survey were used to estimate vaccination coverage at the national, regional, state, territorial, and selected local area levels  among children born in 2016 and 2017. National coverage by age 24 months was >=90% for >=3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, >=3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and >=1 dose of varicella vaccine (VAR); national coverage was >=90% for >=1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), although MMR coverage was <90% in 14 states. Coverage with >=2 doses of influenza vaccine was higher for children born during 2016-2017 (58.1%) than for those born during 2014-2015 (53.8%) but was the lowest among all vaccines studied. Only 1.2% of children had received no vaccinations by age 24 months. Vaccination coverage among children enrolled in Medicaid or with no health insurance was lower than that among children who were privately insured. The prevalence of being completely unvaccinated was highest among uninsured children (4.1%), lower among those enrolled in Medicaid (1.3%), and lowest among those with private insurance (0.8%). The largest disparities on the basis of health insurance status occurred for >=2 doses of influenza vaccine and for completion of the rotavirus vaccination series. Considering the disruptions to health care provider operations caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extra effort will be required to achieve and maintain high levels of coverage with routine childhood vaccinations. Providers, health care entities, and public health authorities can communicate with families about how children can be vaccinated safely during the pandemic, remind parents of vaccinations that are due for their children, and provide all recommended vaccinations to children during clinic visits. This will be especially important for 2020-21 seasonal influenza vaccination to mitigate the effect of two potentially serious respiratory viruses circulating in the community simultaneously."	false
0	A Mathematical Model to Investigate the Transmission of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) on March 02, 2020, Saudi Arabia has not reported quite a rapid COVD-19 spread as seen in America and many European countries. Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, a susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model was formulated, and a basic analysis of the model is presented including model positivity, boundedness, and stability around the disease-free equilibrium. It is found that the model is locally and globally stable around the disease-free equilibrium when R0 < 1. The model parameterized from COVID-19 confirmed cases reported by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia (MOH) from March 02 till April 14, while some parameters are estimated from the literature. The numerical simulation showed that the model predicted infected curve is in good agreement with the real data of COVID-19-infected cases. An analytical expression of the basic reproduction number R0 is obtained, and the numerical value is estimated as R0 = 2.7.Copyright © 2020 Fehaid Salem Alshammari.	false

0	A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders in Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background There is not enough evidence to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health disorders among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: In the present systematic review, a search process was conducted to screen the databases of ProQuest, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and MEDLINE for the relevant articles published between 2019 and 2020. The quality of the articles was assessed by the STROBE checklist. Results: From the relevant studies, 15 were selected for review. The results showed the prevalence of anxiety was between 3.8 to 17.5% in Asian countries, with the lowest in Iran (3.8%) and the highest in Sri Lanka (17.5 %). The prevalence of anxiety was from 23.9 to 72% in Western countries, with the lowest in the USA (23%) and the highest in Canada (72%). In two of the studies in China, the prevalence of anxiety was from 3.09 to 29.6% and of depression from 5.2 to 40%. The incidence rate of self-harm thoughts as a result of the epidemic was significantly high (RR=2.85, 95% CI= 1.70, 8.85, P=0.005). Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety was from 3.8 to 17.5% in Asian countries and from 23.9 to 72% in Western countries. The prevalence of depression was from 5.2 to 40%. Moderate levels of anxiety and depression were reported in Western countries compared with Asian countries. Depression and anxiety should be regularly screened in obstetrics and gynecology wards following the current epidemic to ensure optimal mental health during pregnancy and infancy.	false
0	Decoding Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection and Transmission. One of the major challenges in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is its asymptomatic transmission. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. On the basis of the genotyping of 75775 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation (i.e., L37F at nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6)). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Artificial intelligence, sequence alignment, and network analysis are applied to show that NSP6 mutation L37F may have compromised the virus's ability to undermine the innate cellular defense against viral infection via autophagy regulation. This assessment is in good agreement with our genotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.	false
0	Corticosteroid injections during the COVID-19 pandemic: experience from a UK centre. Aims: To describe the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 infection following corticosteroid injections (CSI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To describe the incidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, positive SARS-COV2 IgG antibody testing or positive imaging findings following CSI at our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: A retrospective observational study was undertaken of consecutive patients who had CSI in our local hospitals between 1 February and 30June 2020. Electronic patient medical records (EPR) and radiology information system (RIS) database were reviewed. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, SARS-COV2 IgG antibody testing, radiological investigations, patient management, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Lung findings were categorized according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines. Reference was made to the incidence of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in our region., Results: Overall, 1,656 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified in our upper tier local authority (UTLA), a rate of 306.6 per 100,000, as of 30June 2020. A total of 504 CSI injections were performed on 443 patients between 1 February and 30June 2020. A total of 11 RT-PCR tests were performed on nine patients (2% of those who had CSI), all of which were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and five patients (1.1%) received an SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test, of which 2 (0.5%) were positive consistent with prior COVID-19 infection, however both patients were asymptomatic. Seven patients (1.6%) had radiological investigations for respiratory symptoms. One patient with indeterminate ground glass change was identified., Conclusion: The incidence of positive COVID-19 infection following corticosteroid injections was very low in our cohort and no adverse clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 infection following CSI were identified. Our findings are consistent with CSI likely being low risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this small observational study are supportive of the current multi-society guidelines regarding the judicious use of CSI.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-9:605-611.

0	Kawasaki-like disease and acute myocarditis in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - reports of three adolescents. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may induce multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which may be associated with Kawasaki-like disease, and cardiac injury. In this study, we presented three male adolescents with multisystem inflammatory syndrome and myocardial injury admitted to the hospital during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. All of the three patients had a history of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorph rash, non-exudative conjunctivitis, and signs of acute myocarditis. One of them had renal failure. Previously, they did not have an acute infection. Upon admission, they were hypotensive and tachycardic. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was negative, but neutralizing viral antibodies were positive. In combination with blood tests, ECG, echocardiography and computerized tomography (CT), a multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with acute myocarditis with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction and dilated coronary arteries were diagnosed. Two of three patients had shock syndrome and required inotropic support. All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. The second patient had a fever up to 102.2degreeF (39degreeC) three days after intravenous immunoglobulins. Further, he was treated according to protocols for refractory Kawasaki disease, with an intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and aspirin. After a few hours, he became afebrile and the clinical signs disappeared. The favorable short-term outcome may reflect the early recognition and adequate therapy; however, the long-term outcomes are currently unknown.	false

OBJECTIVES: To identify characteristics that predict 30-day mortality among patients critically ill with coronavirus disease 2019 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland., DESIGN: Observational cohort study., SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units., PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables)., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 6,027 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration., CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.	false

The presentation mechanism is: reactive-adaptive to the pandemic; triggering factor, before a previous affective-emotional instability; decompensation of a pre-existing process. The clinical features have had their initial phase, fundamentally, in confinement: somatoform disorders, behavioral disorders, emotional symptoms, reactivation of child abuse and dysfunctional grief reactions. The most prevalent symptoms are of the anxious or anxious-depressive type. The response to chronic stress, including that of low profile and intensity but maintained over time, has significant repercussions for childhood and adolescence. Few percentage that present prominent mental disorders, but we must recognize that when projected to the whole the child-adolescent population, there could be a significant number that could be subsidiary of a more specific help.

Several vaccine candidates to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have entered or will soon enter large-scale, phase 3, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. To facilitate harmonized evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these vaccines, a general set of clinical endpoints is proposed, along with considerations to guide the selection of the primary endpoints on the basis of clinical and statistical reasoning. The plausibility that vaccine protection against symptomatic COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward more SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic is highlighted, as well as the potential implications of such a shift.	false
0	The psychological burden experienced by Chinese citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak: prevalence and determinants. BACKGROUND: The present study is aims to investigate the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety among the general population in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China., METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report survey methodology was used to gather the following data from Chinese citizens: sociodemographic information, physical and mental health disorder history, daily online time, social media exposure, feeling toward social media exposure, perception of the disease, infection cases in the local area, and previous experiences with stressful life incidents. Levels of anxiety and depression were self-reported employing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, respectively., RESULTS: Among the 6130 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 7.1 and 12%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that psychological disturbances were associated with gender, people with religious background, being a medical professional, having physical or mental health disease, difficulty accessing medical aids, experience with traumatic incidents, the perceived possibility of sequelae after being cured of COVID-19, daily online time, the source of the information relevant to COVID-19, frequency of receiving information regarding COVID-19, and negative feelings triggered by social media., CONCLUSIONS: There needs to be a consistent message from authorities to reduce the panic and confusion of the public, and to decrease public exposure to persistently negative information. It is necessary to help people transform their negative experiences into positive changes especially for individuals with physical illness, individuals with mental health disorders, and medical professionals.	false

0	COVID-19 in children: Epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis and management. The new pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected children, including neonates, who mostly comprise of approximately 2% of total confirmed cases. Most children are asymptomatic or have mild disease and much lower mortality compared to adults for yet unknown reasons. Recovery from illness has largely been universal and <2% have severe disease requiring intensive care. Standardised guidelines from initial studies are now available for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Treatment is mostly supportive with no recommendations for any specific drugs so far. As the pandemic evolves, it is expected that more children will be diagnosed and treated with evolving newer regimens. Research should now focus on early diagnosis, better drugs for children, intensive care modalities, and a universal vaccine. New developments will help in better prevention asides from the other precautionary measures already being practiced.Copyright © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association. All rights reserved.	false

Objective This study aimed to estimate and investigate the prevalence and the risk factors implicated in contact dermatitis among healthcare workers in the Al'Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional survey among healthcare workers at hospitals in the Al'Qassim region. Data was collected using a standardized and validated Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire version 2002. We included 408 participants in the analysis. Results The majority of the respondents (66.7%) were females. The mean age of participants was 34 (SD: +/- 9) years. Most of the participants who reported contact dermatitis were nurses (58.6%). Direct patient care roles represent 78% of participants. Respondents who work 40-50 hours per week represent 61.5% of the sample. The most commonly recorded symptoms were dryness (92.9%), itchiness (50%), and redness (46.4%) of the skin. The most affected site was hand 93.5%. Hand cleanser was the commonest substance implicated in the worsening of the skin changes (59.2%). Protective glove material that worsens contact dermatitis, such as natural rubber/latex, represents 76% of responses. A significant association (p=0.001)was seen in the occurrence of contact dermatitis in those with a history of allergic eye symptoms (33.3%) and those without (58%). Participants with a mean age of 26.47 years were more prone to develop contact dermatitis (CI: 1.19-7.06; p=0.067). Pharmacists and interns had 3.69 and 4.90 times higher odds of having contact dermatitis (CI: 0.95-7.33; CI: 22.1; p=0.027; p=0.038, respectively). Those involved in patient education and research activities at work were 6.48 (p=0.017) and 20.51 (p=0.024) times likely to develop contact dermatitis (CI: 1.38-30.31; CI: 1.49-282.15, respectively). Conclusions We explored the prevalence and risk factors for occupational contact dermatitis among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. The prevalence of reported skin changes during the pandemic was 46.4%. Our study also showed that the risk factors of developing contact dermatitis include female gender, history of eye allergies, and young age group.	false
0	COVID-19 in Dialysis Patients: Outlasting and Outsmarting a Pandemic. COVID-19 has affected dialysis patients and dialysis patient care worldwide. In this issue of Kidney International, three reports highlight the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients, noting its high prevalence, particularly among in-center dialysis patients. This likely reflects patients' limited ability to physically distance as well as community exposures, including residence in areas with high rates of infection. Dialysis patients are at extremely high risk should they develop COVID-19, with short-term mortality of 20% or higher. Accordingly, it is imperative that the kidney community intervene to reduce the threat of COVID-19 in the vulnerable population by focusing on modifiable factors, including universal masking of patients and staff and enhanced screening, including testing asymptomatic patients for COVID-19 in times of high local prevalence.Copyright © 2020.

0	Low Incidence and Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Southern Europe. Proposal of a hypothesis for Arthropod borne Herd immunity. SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in Europe have shown wide variation. Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author's opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest possibly over many generations. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to, (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself, or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection. The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease.	false
0	Stretching and break-up of saliva filaments during speech: A route for pathogen aerosolization and its potential mitigation. Speech is a potent route for viral transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic. Informed mitigation strategies are difficult to develop since no aerosolization mechanism has been visualized yet in the oral cavity. Here we show with high-speed imaging how phonation of common stop consonants, found in most of the world's spoken languages, form and extend salivary filaments in a few milliseconds as moist lips open or when the tongue separates from the teeth. Both saliva viscoelasticity and airflow associated with the plosion of stop consonants are essential for stabilizing and subsequently forming centimeter-scale thin filaments, tens of microns in diameter, that break into speech droplets. Moreover, these plosive consonants induce vortex rings that drive meter-long transport of exhaled air, tying this mechanism to transport associated with speech. We demonstrate that a similar mechanism of aerosolization occurs during the vibration of reeds in wind instruments and may occur during the flapping of the glottis folds. Finally, our research suggests a mitigation of droplet production during speech by using a lip balm.	false
0	Prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety among healthcare workers: A cross-sectional study. Introduction: COVID-19 was labeled as a pandemic in March 2020. Healthcare workers (HCW) are confronting great mental stressors in coping with the crisis. In Saudi Arabia, research on the psychological effect of COVID-19 on HCW is lacking., Aim: To evaluate COVID-19 psychological impact on HCW and determine anxiety predictors to identify high-risk individuals., Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on HCW in First Health Cluster Institutes in Eastern Province. An English self-administered questionnaire was adopted from similar research done in China. The original questionnaires were modified to meet the objectives of our study and suit Saudi sociodemographic differences. Generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale was incorporated to be the main tool for assessing the psychological impact., Results: One-third of HCW were classified as having anxiety disorder. In univariate analyses, the age group in years (P = 0.026), gender (P = 0.001), nationality (P = 0.033), and living with family (P = 0.007) significantly influenced anxiety disorder. However, in the multivariate regression model, gender (P = 0.004), living with family (P = 0.021), family history of COVID-19 (P = 0.022), and been suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 infection (P = 0.018) remained statistically significant when compared to anxiety disorder., Conclusion: During early COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety disorder among HCW was noticeable. Being a female, living with family members, and having a family history of COVID-19 increased the risk for anxiety disorder. Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.	false
0	Understanding value in oral health: the oral health value-based care symposium. OBJECTIVE: There are both opportunities and challenges with the implementation of oral health value-based care (OHVBC). To tackle concerns and advance conversation, a symposium was convened with subject matter experts to develop a gap analysis and capture insights into professional readiness for value-based care design. METHOD(S): The symposium was convened as a private event for 46 participants over the course of one and a half days in December 2019. Thematic analyses utilized the OHVBC Readiness Framework (DentaQuest Partnership, 2019) to further codify conversations as part of the gap-analysis process. Poll Everywhere, a text messaging application that allows participants to answer questions in real time, was also employed to solicit responses. RESULT(S): Attendees of the symposium felt that OHVBC would have a large portion of market share within the next 10years. A qualitative assessment of multiple table discussions determined that the participants developed more consensus around themes for the current state and the future-desired state than the action-planning needed to close the gap between the two. This may relate to individual ideology, and the siloed environment is still prevalent in the oral health realm. In a postsymposium survey, respondent attendees did not perceive that COVID-19 would delay or negatively impact the adoption of OHVBC and may result in accelerating its utilization. CONCLUSION(S): The oral health community is experiencing multiple drivers to adopt more OHVBC within business and care models. However, there is still a lack of uniformity on how to execute this delivery model.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Public Health Dentistry.	false
0	Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. The first SARS-CoV-2 patient was detected in Portugal on the 2nd of March 2020, by then the virus was already spread worldwide. Same publications refer to an increase in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) during the pandemic period.1-3 The purpose of this study is comparing the incidence of OHCA in Portugal in the first months of the pandemic, with the same period of the previous year. A retrospective observational study was performed, with data collected from the Portuguese's National Registry of Cardiac Arrests (OHCA records) between the 1st of March and the 31st of May of 2020 compared with the homologous period of 2019. During the referred period were registered in 2020 a total of 4673 cases of OHCA, 11% more than in 2019 during the same period (n = 4201). No gender or age differences were found between the two samples. OHCA happened more frequently at home (77.30% vs. 73.96%), with a decrease in public places (6.24% vs. 4.60%). No difference was found between nursery homes (13.28% vs. 13.08%) or other undefined places (6.52% vs. 5.03%). The cause of OHCA showed no major differences concerning cardiac (48.92% vs. 49.41%), respiratory (4.78% vs. 4.39%) and other undefined causes (42.23% vs. 43.55%), nevertheless there was a reduction in traumatic OHCA (4.07% vs. 2.67%). Life support manoeuvres were performed in 74.93% of the OCHA cases in 2020, 6.17% less than in 2019 (68.76%). From these, ROSC (Return Of Spontaneous Circulation) was obtained in fewer cases in 2020 than in 2019 (8.45% vs. 4.17%). These results suggest a slight increase in OHCA from March to May 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Nevertheless these results should be analysed taking into consideration COVID 19 incidence in Portugal during the reference period and the confinement measures.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The Clinical and Economic Value of a Successful Shutdown During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Germany. Background and aim: A shutdown of businesses enacted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can serve different goals, e.g., preventing the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity from being overwhelmed ('flattening the curve') or keeping the reproduction number substantially below one ('squashing the curve'). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in 'flattening' or 'squashing the curve' in Germany., Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19., Results: A shutdown that is successful in 'flattening the curve' is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.01 and 0.05 life years (0.1 to 0.6 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between 616 and 4797 per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 1% to 12% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in 'squashing the curve' is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.8 life years (0.9 months) per capita, corresponding to 19% of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases., Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population. Nevertheless, questions around the affordability and underfunding of other parts of the healthcare system emerge.

0	Healthcare Personnel Absenteeism, Presenteeism, and Staffing Challenges During Epidemics. Presenteeism is an expensive and challenging problem in the healthcare industry. In anticipation of the staffing challenges expected with the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined a decade of payroll data for a healthcare workforce. We aimed to determine the effect of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) on absences to support COVID-19 staffing plans. Both hours worked and unscheduled absences were significantly related to the community prevalence of influenza-like illness in our cohort. These effects were stronger in hourly employees suggesting that organizations should target their messaging at encouraging salaried staff to stay home when ill.	false
0	COVID-19 Vaccines on Clinical Trials and their Mode of Action for Immunity against the Virus. For nearly two decades, coronaviruses have caused many health and economic problems, while no effective commercial vaccine has yet been developed. It is worth mentioning that despite some mutations and recombination in SARS-CoV-2, its genotype is very close to the original strain from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be promising. It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement is may threaten vaccinated people's lives and long-term side effect must be considered. To this end, targeting of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) in spike and not whole spike, glycolization of FC receptors, PD-1 blockers, CPPs, etc. are promising. Therefore, the subunit vaccines or RNA vaccines that encode the RBP segment of the spike are of interest. To enhance the vaccine efficacy, its co-delivery with an adjuvant has been recommended. Nanoparticles modulate immune response with higher efficiency than the soluble form of antigens and can be functionalized with the positively charged moieties and ligands of targeted cells, such as dendritic cells, to increase cellular uptake of the antigens and their presentation on the surface of immune cells. This research aimed to discuss the COVID-19 vaccines entering the clinical trial and their mode of action effective immunity against the virus and discusses their advantages compared to each other.

0	Norwich COVID-19 testing initiative pilot: evaluating the feasibility of asymptomatic testing on a university campus. BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of COVID-19 in university-age students, who are returning to campuses. There is little evidence regarding the feasibility of universal, asymptomatic testing to help control outbreaks in this population. This study aimed to pilot mass COVID-19 testing on a university research park, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up testing to all staff and students., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional feasibility study on a university research park in the East of England. All staff and students (5625) were eligible to participate. All participants were offered four PCR swabs, which they self-administered over two weeks. Outcome measures included uptake, drop-out rate, positivity rates, participant acceptability measures, laboratory processing measures, data collection and management measures., RESULTS: 798 (76%) of 1053 who registered provided at least one swab; 687 (86%) provided all four; 792 (99%) of 798 who submitted at least one swab had all negative results and 6 participants had one inconclusive result. There were no positive results. 458 (57%) of 798 participants responded to a post-testing survey, demonstrating a mean acceptability score of 4.51/5, with five being the most positive., CONCLUSIONS: Repeated self-testing for COVID-19 using PCR is feasible and acceptable to a university population.

0	Associations between governor political affiliation and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States. Introduction: As the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC)., Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 through September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health., Results: From March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) through September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20, 2.24)., Conclusion: Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the US. As attitudes toward the pandemic become increasingly polarized, policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than political ideology.	false
0	Early indicators and risk factors associated with mental health problems during COVID-19 quarantine: Is there a relationship with the number of confirmed cases and deaths?. BACKGROUND: On March 20 2020, the Argentine Ministry of Health enforced a mandatory quarantine throughout the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: The object of this study is to determine the initial impact on mental health of Argentine population, by measuring the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and self-perceived stress and by determining the associated risk factors, and to analyze that impact in relation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey was conducted through a digital questionnaire, which was completed by 1,985 respondents between March 29 and April 12. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), the 9-Item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. RESULT(S): The 62.4% of the surveyed population reported signs of psychological distress. It was found that being a woman, being 18 to 27years old, living with family members or a partner, smoking, and having a poor sleep quality were the significant risk factors. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the low number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths at that time, a strong impact on mental health indicators was revealed. The authors of this study recommend the monitoring of the population at risk over time and early interventions in order to avoid long-lasting mental health problems.	false
0	What are protective antibody responses to pandemic SARS-CoV-2?. Human antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) hold intense interest with research efforts directed at optimizing antibody-based interventions and monitoring immune status. By relating individual variations in antibody response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, beneficial antiviral immune responses may be identified in detail. In this issue of the JCI, Secchi and collaborators describe antibody response profiles in 509 COVID-19 patients from Italy during the 2020 pandemic. The research team found that multiple antibody types to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens developed over four weeks. Notably, IgG against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) was predictive of survival and IgA against the viral spike protein (S protein) associated with rapid virologic clearance. These results may help guide selection of convalescent plasma, hyperimmune products, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19.	false
0	Predictive indicators of severe COVID-19 independent of comorbidities and advanced age: A nested case -control study. To determine what exacerbate severity of the COVID-19 among patients without comorbidities and advanced age and investigate potential clinical indicators for early surveillance, we adopted anested case-control study, design in which severe cases (case group, n=67) and moderate cases(control group, n=67)of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without comorbidities, with ages ranging from 18 to 50 years who admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital werematched based on age, sex and BMI. Demographic and clinical characteristics, andrisk factors associated with severe symptoms were analyzed. Percutaneous oxygen saturation(SpO2), lymphocytecounts,C-reactive protein (CRP)and IL-10were found closely associated with severe COVID-19. The adjusted multivariablelogistic regression analyses revealed thatthe independent risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 were CRP (OR=2.037, 95%CI: 1.078-3.847, p=0.028), SpO2 (OR=1.639, 95%CI: 0.943-2.850, p=0.080) and lymphocyte (OR=1.530, 95%CI: 0.850-2.723, p=0.148), whereas the changesexhibited by indicators influenced incidence of disease severity. Males exhibited higher levels of indicators associated with inflammation, myocardial injury, and kidney injurythanthe females. Thisstudy reveals that increased CRP levels and decreased SpO2and lymphocyte counts could serve as potential indicators of severe COVID-19, independent of comorbidities, advanced age and sex. Males couldat higher risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 than females.Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence. Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will likely require the rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals on an ongoing basis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, since sample dilution increases the likelihood of false negatives for individuals with low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Likewise, minimising the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimising the time testing takes to reduce the spread of infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests and rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (cf. 30-fold to 48-fold dilution in Refs. 9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor which, furthermore, increases as the prevalence falls. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to closely and continually monitor infection in a population, along with rapid and effective isolation of infected people, provides a promising pathway to the longterm control of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.	false

0	"The Role of Air Conditioning in the Diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 in Indoor Environments: a First Computational Fluid Dynamic Model, based on Investigations performed at the Vatican State Children's Hospital. BACKGROUND: About 15 million people worldwide were affected by the Sars-Cov-2 infection, which already caused 600,000 deaths. This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. METHOD(S): We modelled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the ""Bambino Gesu"" Vatican State Children's Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (eta) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient's mouth was also assessed. RESULT(S): Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 seconds from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient's mouth in the first 0.5 seconds following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the eta index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. CONCLUSION(S): CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	COVID-19 and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation in Naples during the Pandemic. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that causes a potentially deadly syndrome that affects especially the respiratory tract. Kidney-transplanted patients are immunosuppressed and more susceptible to viral infections. We have examined our transplantation activity to explore the future role of kidney transplantation from deceased and living donors in COVID-19 era. Patients and Methods. The activity of our transplant center of Naples (one of the two transplant centers in Campania, South Italy) continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analysed the kidney transplants carried out between March 9 and June 9, 2020, comparing these data with the numbers of procedures performed in the two previous years. Moreover, we have considered the possibility of performing living donor transplants during a worldwide pandemic., Results: From March 9, 2020, when the Italian lockdown begun, till June 9, 2020, five kidney transplants have been performed at our transplant center in Naples, all from deceased donors. The donors and the recipients have been screened for COVID-19 infection, and the patients, all asymptomatic, followed strict preventive measures and were fully informed about the risks of surgery and immunosuppression during a pandemic. All the transplanted patients remained COVID negative during the follow-up. The number of transplants performed has been constant compared to the same months of 2018 and 2019. In agreement with the patients, we decided to postpone living donor transplants to a period of greater control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in Italy., Conclusion: Deceased donor kidney transplantation should continue, especially in a region with moderate risk, like Campania, with a more careful selection of donors and recipients, preferring standard donors and recipients without severe comorbidities. Living donor transplantation program, instead, should be postponed to a period of greater control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread, as it is an elective surgery and its delay does not determine additional risks for patients.

0	Knowledge about COVID-19 and Practices among Hemodialysis Technicians in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era. Introduction: Hemodialysis technicians play a crucial role in infection control practices in hemodialysis units. Thus, it is important to assess the knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 among hemodialysis technicians in this pandemic situation., Materials and Methods: An online survey composed of 22 closed-ended questions using Google Forms was conducted in the month of April (13th to 19th) 2020. The survey consisted of questions regarding the knowledge of COVID-19 and current hemodialysis practice among hemodialysis technicians. The study was approved by the institutional ethics board. The survey was administered online through a mobile phone invitation. Basic statistics (mean and standard deviation or total number and percent) were computed for all covariates., Results: Out of 150, 115 technicians participated in the survey. 80.9% of the participants were males. The mean age of respondents was 28.22 + 6.97 years. Most of the respondents could correctly identify fever (87.8%), breathlessness (86.08%), and dry cough (81.7%) as the symptoms of COVID-19 infection. 75.7% of the technicians were aware that it can be transmitted by asymptomatic persons. 61.1% of the technicians were segregating patients who had symptoms such as fever and cough to the last shift of the day. 81.1% of the technicians read the guidelines issued by the Indian Society of Nephrology-COVID-19 working group. But, only 25.5% of the respondents could rightly identify to keep a minimum distance of two meters between two beds while dialyzing a suspected patient of COVID-19 along with other patients to minimise risk of COVID-19 transmission. 60% of the technicians have received hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis against coronavirus infection., Conclusion: Our study shows a significant knowledge gap among hemodialysis technicians about COVID-19. Effective COVID-19 education campaigns should be carried out intensively with relevant information among hemodialysis technicians to address the knowledge gap. A well-informed hemodialysis technician can prove to be a great tool to spread the right infection control practices among dialysis-dependent patients. Copyright © 2020 Amit S. Pasari et al.	false

0	Vitamin D Status in Hospitalized Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients is a matter of debate., OBJECTIVES: To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity., METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of 216 COVID-19 patients and 197 population-based controls. Serum 25OHD levels were measured in both groups. The association of serum 25OHD levels with COVID-19 severity (admission to the intensive care unit, requirements for mechanical ventilation, or mortality) was also evaluated., RESULTS: Of the 216 patients, 19 were on vitamin D supplements and were analyzed separately. In COVID-19 patients, mean +/- standard deviation 25OHD levels were 13.8 +/- 7.2 ng/mL, compared with 20.9 +/- 7.4 ng/mL in controls (P < .0001). 25OHD values were lower in men than in women. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (P < .0001). 25OHD inversely correlates with serum ferritin (P = .013) and D-dimer levels (P = .027). Vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, raised serum ferritin and troponin levels, as well as a longer length of hospital stay than those with serum 25OHD levels >=20 ng/mL. No causal relationship was found between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity as a combined endpoint or as its separate components., CONCLUSIONS: 25OHD levels are lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in population-based controls and these patients had a higher prevalence of deficiency. We did not find any relationship between vitamin D concentrations or vitamin deficiency and the severity of the disease. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Facial palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and clinical features of individuals presenting in emergency rooms (ER) with facial palsy during the Italian COVID-19 outbreak and in the same period of 2019., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for all accesses to the six ER in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (27 February-3 May 2020) to identify all cases of diagnosed facial palsy. Clinical information was retrieved for each patient and compared with that of facial palsy cases presenting in 2019., RESULT: Between 27 February and 3 May 2020, 38 patients presented to provincial ERs for facial palsy; in 2019, there were 22 cases, for an incidence rate ratio of 1.73 (95% CI 1.02-2.92) for the 2020 cohort. Of the 2020 cohort, eight patients (21%) presented with active or recent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, compared with 2 (9%) in 2019 (p = .299); one was tested and resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, patients were younger (-11 years, p = .037) than those of the previous year and manifested a longer lag (+1.1 days, p = .001) between symptoms onset and ER presentation., CONCLUSION: We observed a higher occurrence of facial palsy during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the same period of the previous year; 21% of patients presenting with facial palsy had active or recent symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an excess risk of facial palsy during or after COVID-19. These patients searched for medical attention later, probably because of the fear of contracting COVID-19 during assistance. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"The smell in COVID-19 infection: Diagnostic opportunities. There is a high prevalence of olfaction changes, especially in the early presentation, in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. The mechanisms through which the virus leads to anos-mia/hyposmia are still not fully understood. However, olfaction changes could be used as an indication for testing or quarantine. Screening for infections and other diseases by recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been previously conducted. Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used as an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom. We propose that the electronic nose could be used as a future screening tool, especially in agglomeration spaces such as airports, for screening for the COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Israel Medical Association.

0	Potential Diagnostic Systems for Coronavirus Detection: A Critical Review. Currently there are no effective anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2, so the primary line of defense is to detect infected cases as soon as possible. The high rate of contagion for this virus and the highly nonspecific symptoms of the disease (Coronovirus disease 2019, (Covid-19)) that it causes, such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia, require the urgent establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance. Nowadays, several virus detection methods are available for viral diseases, which act on specific properties of each virus or virus family, therefore, further investigations and trials are needed to find a highly efficient and accurate detection method to detect and prevent the outcomes of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need for more and precise studies in this field. In this review, we discussed the properties of a new generation of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) following routine virus detection methods and proposed new strategies and the use of potential samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Precautions during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES At the beginning of January 2020, a new coronavirus was isolated, a potentially lethal respiratory infectious agent called SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes was called COVID-19 (COronaVIrusDisease 2019). From a microbiological point of view, coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of RNA microorganisms causing respiratory diseases with a wide spectrum of intensity, from the common cold to severe respiratory syndromes (SARS-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, MERS-Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). DISCUSSION As for other respiratory viruses, the transmission pathways is the airborne one (through the drop-lets by the infected patient) and direct contact. Experimental data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 re-mains active in aerosols for a long time, and droplets can settle contaminating the surfaces of the operating room. Dental professionals have consequently been classified as highrisk subjects. Among the guidelines for the control of cross-infection in dentistry, a common denominator appears to be the triage. The aim of this procedure is to avoid the treatment of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients in unequipped health facilities. The triage applies a set of questions on the patient's state of health in two specific moments, spaced over time, in order to per-form a double-check. A first triage is be carried out by telephone and a second during the arrival at the dental practice. From the disinfection point of view, ethanol at a concentration higher than 78% appears to be able to inactivate the virus in 60 seconds as well as 0.1% sodium hypochlorite and 1% povidone io-dine. Furthermore, the use of anti-microbial mouthwashes seems useful to reduce the contamination by aerosols produced by dental handpieces. From the mouthwashes point of view, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide is active in 60 seconds, 1% povidone iodine in 15-60 seconds, while benzalkoni-um chloride and chlorhexidine demonstrated a reduced efficacy against coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS From the point of view of aerosol contamination, the risk for the Dentist appears real. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The results of recent research demonstrate how the spray emit-ted by the turbine, multiplier contra-angle, and ultrasonic scaler is able to contaminate the whole operatory room, including the walls and the ceiling, up to a maximum distance of 360 cm. We do not have direct experimental evidence, but it seems useful to replace mains water of the hand-pieces spray with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide. This measure could significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 spreading by the aerosol produced by the handpieces. In this way, the infectious agent would leave the oral cavity of the positive patient with the disinfectant agent. The risk of cross-infection should be significantly reduced.Copyright © 2020 EDRA SpA. Tutti i diritti riservati.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 in the management of AL amyloidosis and Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease: A single center experience. INTRODUCTION: Patients with AL amyloidosis and immunoglobulin deposition diseases (IDD) are vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the immune compromise from the plasma cell disorder and therapy related immune defects. We describe a local experience in providing care for patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD., METHOD: Patient treatment and disease status since the beginning of the pandemic on March 11, 2020 as declared by WHO, were collected and analyzed., RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD were included. Four patients with IDD and 22 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis were receiving treatment during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, patients' treatments were discontinued if they achieved VGPR or better post induction. Seven patients discontinued all treatment after achieving VGPR and others required treatment modifications. 28 patients have been tested for COVID-19, and all tests have been negative. Three patients died since the pandemic, two from organ complications of systemic AL amyloidosis and one from an unrelated cause., CONCLUSION: The management of AL amyloidosis and IDD must be individualized on the clinical characteristics, centers' access to care under the pandemic restrictions, and the epidemiological aspects of the outbreak.

0	Clinical features, laboratory findings and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Sardinia, Italy. OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, when the first SARS-CoV2 infections have been reported, the number of cases has increased exponentially. In our University Hospital Unit, the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted on the 8th of March 2020. We aimed to investigate the predictors of death among inpatients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, monocentric study, consecutively enrolling patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected from the 8th of March to the 8th of April 2020. We aimed to describe the most frequent clinical and laboratory features and predictors of death among patients admitted to our Unit. RESULT(S): 87 patients were enrolled, 56 (64.4%) were male, with a median age of 72 (IQR 62.5-83.5) years. The majority of our population had at least one comorbidity in their medical anamnesis. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease were the most frequent, followed by obesity. Eighty (92%) patients had at least one symptom, whereas 7 (8%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever and dyspnoea. Overall, 53 patients had lung disease confirmed at CT scan (60.9%). Twenty-five (28.7%) deaths occurred. Statistically significant predictors of death at multivariate analysis were lymphocytes count <900 cells/mm3, moderate ARDS, and lack of compliance at baseline. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first Italian experience available. Our results seem to be in line with international literature. As highlighted by our data, more studies are needed to investigate the role of lymphocytes subsets, CT scan values. Furthermore, therapy choice and timing in this challenging setting should be urgently investigated in randomized clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.	false
0	Recommendations, Practices and Infrastructural Model for the Dental Radiology Set-up in Clinical and Academic Institutions in the COVID-19 Era. Simple Summary Since the inception of COVID-19, the international and national agencies across the globe have issued several guidelines and recommendations for the public as well as to the healthcare professionals. The fast spreading nature of this disease has brought various changes in the screening and treatment protocols in medicine and dentistry. Oral radiology is an integral part of oral screening and various dental treatment strategies. During oral radiology procedures, oral radiologists/radiology technicians come in direct contact with the patient as well as their body fluids such as saliva. It increases the risk of disease transmission from patients to oral radiologist and vice versa. Hence, proper infection control protocol should be implemented with new guidelines. This paper explains the practices to be followed in the oral radiology clinics at various stages whether in commercial set up or academic institute. Additionally, it explains the various precautions and new recommendations to be taken during various radiographic techniques. To add more, emphasis the importance of safe distancing, barrier protection and decontamination to be followed in dental clinics to prevent the spread of infection. Furthermore, the feasibility and procedure of online teaching methods for oral radiology clinics has been discussed. The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a global catastrophe that is plaguing mankind. In the past eight months since the world discovered about COVID-19, we learned a lot about server acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) and perhaps there is much more to discover and understand about the virus. With the current understanding of the disease, we assume it will remain in an active state of transmission and progression among the community for a long time. Thus, it is advisable to adopt the disease's prevention protocol in our daily and work routine. During this pandemic patient requiring dental treatment cannot be neglected and the role of dental imaging is crucial in delivering treatment. Hence, this article attempts to provide an evidence-based compilation about the mode of transmission and clinical features of COVID-19. It also throws light on the potential source of disease transmission in the dental radiology setting. In addition, it suggests preventive measures to curb the infection and infrastructural model of the clinical setting that will assist in achieving control over the disease transmission. This article intends to project a strategy about protocols, infrastructure, and daily activities in a dental radiology office that institutions can adopt with modifications according to their local scenario.	false

0	Cutaneous eruption in COVID-19-infected patients in Thailand: An observational descriptive study. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Thailand in January 2020. Thailand was the first to report a confirmed case outside China. Cutaneous eruption in COVID-19 has been reported since the disease became pandemic but limited in tropical countries such as Thailand. The aim of this study was to observe the incidence, characteristics and relation of cutaneous eruption with COVID-19 at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, a referral center of emerging infectious diseases in Thailand. An observational descriptive study observed the incidence and characteristics of cutaneous eruption in 204 COVID-19-infected patients at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute. We report five patients, who represented six incidences of skin eruption with four characteristics: maculopapular rash (50%), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (16.67%), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (16.67%) and urticarial vasculitis (16.67%). Incidences of cutaneous eruption in COVID-19 at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute were low. Most of the incidents were associated with medication used to treat COVID-19 infection, so drug allergy cannot be excluded as a cause of the rashes. Therefore, drug allergy should always be ruled out, and skin manifestation in COVID-19-infected patients should be further observed. Copyright © 2020 Japanese Dermatological Association.	false
0	Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Gene 5 Modulates Pathogenesis in Mice. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia that emerged in 2012. There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing non-synonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo, both in humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL), or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-DELTA5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-DELTA5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-DELTA5 in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nt deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-DELTA5 infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that rMERS-MA-DELTA5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (~35%). Animal models together with reverse genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection, and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.

0	Psycho-social impact of social distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19 containment measures on patients with physical disabilities. BACKGROUND: While the Covid-19 pandemic was spreading worldwide, the Italian government stated lockdown, with a drastic reorganization in of healthcare systems. The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment., AIM: Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress., DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study., SETTING: Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa., POPULATION: 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled., METHODS: A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed., RESULTS: Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency., CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability. This unexpected and reassuring result may reveal a worrying scenario regarding the social participation and quality of life of people with disabilities: were they already in lockdown?	false
0	The COVID-19 stress may influence on the sex ratio at birth. The ratio of boys to girls (sex ratio) at birth (SRB) is about 1.01-1.05 in most populations and is influenced by various factors, such as maternal stress, maternal inflammation, and endocrine disruption. Male fetus is biologically weaker and more vulnerable to prenatal events than female fetuses. Hence, premature death (and consequently decline the SRB) is higher in boys than girls. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been known to have a variety of stressful and psychological impacts. This stress may consequently enhance maternal inflammation, pregnancy complication, and fetal loss. Also, male fetuses have more adverse outcomes than female fetuses among asymptomatic pregnant women with SARS-Cov-2 infection. Inasmuch as the male fetus are more vulnerable to prenatal events and premature death, it is proposed that the SRB can decline in pregnant women following the COVID-19 stress. However, future studies are needed to define the impact of the COVID-19 on SRB rate.	false
0	Nanobodies: an unexplored opportunity to combat COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is capable of human-to-human transmission, and is spreading rapidly round the globe, with markedly high fatality rates. Unfortunately, there are neither vaccines nor specific therapies available to combat it, and the developments of such approaches depend on pursuing multiple avenues in biomedical science. Accordingly, in this paper we highlight one such avenue-nanobodies-for potential utility in therapeutic and diagnostic interventions to combat COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	false
0	The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm for the selection of stable elements of secondary structure to be included in vaccine peptides. AIMS: The aim of this study was to create a new version of the PentaFOLD algorithm and to test its performance experimentally in several proteins and peptides., BACKGROUND: Synthetic vaccines can cause production of neutralizing antibodies only in case if short peptides form the same secondary structure as fragments of full-length proteins. The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm was designed to check stability of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils using several propensity scales obtained during analysis of 1730 3D structures of proteins., OBJECTIVE: The algorithm has been tested in the three peptides known to keep the secondary structure of the corresponding fragments of full-length proteins: the NY25 peptide from the Influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin, the SF23 peptide from the diphtheria toxin, the NQ21 peptide from the HIV1 gp120; as well as in the CC36 peptide from the human major prion protein., METHOD: Affine chromatography for antibodies against peptides accompanied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to check the predictions of the algorithm., RESULT: Immunological experiments showed that all abovementioned peptides are more or less immunogenic in rabbits. The fact that antibodies against the NY25, the SF23, and the NQ21 form stable complexes with corresponding full-length proteins has been confirmed by affine chromatography. The surface of SARS CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain interacting with hACE2 has been shown to be unstable according to the results of the PentaFOLD 3.0., CONCLUSION: The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm (http://chemres.bsmu.by/PentaFOLD30.htm) can be used with the aim to design vaccine peptides with stable secondary structure elements.

0	Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Current status. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta coronavirus, which first appeared in 2019 and rapidly spread causing a worldwide pandemic. Here we present a nonsystematic review of the current knowledge on its epidemiological features. The SARS-CoV-2 replicates mainly in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is mainly transmitted by droplets and aerosols from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). Similar to the related coronaviruses SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), superspreading events play an important role in spreading the disease. The majority of infections run an uncomplicated course but 5-10% of those infected develop pneumonia or a systemic inflammation leading to hospitalization, respiratory and potentially multiorgan failure. The most important risk factors for a complicated disease course are age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and immunodeficiency. The current infection fatality rate over all age groups is between 0.5% and 1% and the rate rises after the sixth decade of life. Nosocomial transmission and infections in medical personnel have been reported. A drastic reduction of social contacts has been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, leading to rapid reductions in R0. Most interventions have used bundles and which of the measures have been more effective is still unknown. Using mathematical models an incidence of 0.4%-1.8% can be estimated for the first wave in Germany.	false
0	Prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among COVID-19 patients: protocol for a living systematic review. Background Previous studies on the impact of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of the patients has been limited by the lack of relevant data. With the rapid and sustained growth of the publications on COVID-19 research, we will perform a living systematic review (LSR) to provide comprehensive and continuously updated data to explore the prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 patients. Methods We will perform a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature to identify relevant studies. We will include peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies published in English and Chinese. Two reviewers will independently assess the methodological quality of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal tool and perform data extraction. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity, the prevalence estimates with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be calculated by using random-effects model to minimize the effect of between-study heterogeneity separately. The literature searches will be updated every 3 months. We will perform meta-analysis if any new eligible studies or data are obtained. We will resubmit an updated review when there were relevant changes in the results, i.e., when outcomes became statistically significant (or not statistically significant anymore) or when heterogeneity became substantial (or not substantial anymore). Discussion This LSR will provide an in-depth and up-to-date summary of whether the common neuropsychiatric conditions observed in patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also prevalent in a different stage of COVID-19 patients.

0	SARS-CoV-2 has displaced other seasonal respiratory viruses: results from a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on existing respiratory viruses in circulation and the overall burden of viral respiratory disease remains uncertain. Traditionally, severe viral respiratory disease disproportionally affects those with underlying chronic lung diseases. This study aimed to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the prevalence and clinical characteristics of respiratory virus disease in hospitalised adults., METHODS: Data for this cohort study were from hospitalised adults who had multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses over several seasons in Hampshire, UK. Respiratory virus detection during the first epidemic peak of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to detection during the same time period across previous years., RESULTS: 856 patients had multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses between March and May over 5 years. Before 2020, a non-SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in 54% patients (202/371) compared to 4.1% (20/485) in 2020 (p<0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 was associated with asthma or COPD exacerbations in a smaller proportion of infected patients compared to other viruses (1.0% vs 37%, p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with substantial reductions in the circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses and large differences in the characteristics of viral-associated disease, including illness in a greater proportion of patients without underlying lung disease.

0	Forecasting Malaysia COVID-19 Incidence based on Movement Control Order using ARIMA and Expert Modeler. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic that affects every other country in the world. Various countries have adopted control measures involving restriction of movement. Several studies have used mathematical modelling to predict the dynamic of this pandemic. Forecasting techniques can be used to predict the incidence cases for the short term. The study aims to forecast the COVID-19 incidence using the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using publicly available data, we performed a forecast of Malaysia COVID-19 new cases using Expert Modeler Method in SPSS and ARIMA model in R to predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. We compare 3 different time frames based on different Movement Control Order (MCO) period. We compare the model fit and prediction across models. RESULTS: All models show static cases for each MCO 7-day prediction. For prediction until 12 May, the third MCO time frame shows the best model fit for both techniques. Both software shows a stationary trend of cases of below 100. CONCLUSION: These MCO models have shown to stabilize the rate of new cases. Further sub analysis and quality of data is needed to improve the accuracy of the model.	false
0	Gastrointestinal Manifestations and Associated Health Outcomes of COVID-19: A Brazilian Experience From the Largest South American Public Hospital. OBJECTIVES: Brazil has rapidly developed the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world. As such, proper symptom identification, including gastrointestinal manifestations, and relationship to health outcomes remains key. We aimed to assess the prevalence and impact of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with COVID-19 in a large quaternary referral center in South America. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study in a COVID-19 specific hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Consecutive adult patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Baseline patient history, presenting symptoms, laboratory results, and clinically relevant outcomes were recorded. Regression analyses were performed to determine significant predictors of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes. RESULTS: Four-hundred patients with COVID-19 were included. Of these, 33.25% of patients reported gastrointestinal symptom. Diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom (17.25%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher rates of concomitant constitutional symptoms, notably fatigue and myalgia (p <0.05). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also more prevalent among patients on chronic immunosuppressants, ACE/ARB medications, and patient with chronic kidney disease (p <0.05). Laboratory results, length of hospitalization, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and in-hospital mortality did not differ based upon gastrointestinal symptoms (p> 0.05). Regression analyses showed older age [OR 1.04 (95% CI, 1.02-1.06)], male gender [OR 1.94 (95% CI, 1.12-3.36)], and immunosuppression [OR 2.60 (95% CI, 1.20-5.63)], were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Based upon this Brazilian study, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are common but do not appear to impact clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes including the need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality.	false
0	Clinical predictors of donor antibody titre and correlation with recipient antibody response in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma clinical trial. Background Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed-effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti-spike). Higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (P = 0.03). In pairwise comparison amongst ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD and anti-spike than O donors (P < 0.05). No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. Non-ECMO recipient anti-RBD antibody titre increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (P = 0.01) and anti-spike antibody titre by 40.3% (P = 0.02). Conclusion Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titre to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titre, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion amongst COVID-19-infected patients is needed.	false
0	Mechanistic Insights to the Binding of Antibody CR3022 Against RBD from SARS-CoV and HCoV-19/SARS-CoV-2: A Computational Study. Aims & Objective: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently in a global outbreak. COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. CR3022, a human monoclonal neutralizing antibody isolated from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recovery patient, was confirmed to be able to bind the S protein of HCoV-19 with a certain degree of neutralizing activity. Crystal structural information indicated that CR3022 could bind to the epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-19, whose epitope consists of 28 amino acids, and 24 of them are conserved in SARS-CoV of SARS. However, the crystal structure is only a static conformation at a certain moment in time, and it cannot provide dynamic details of the interaction between antigen and antibody., Methods: In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with MM/PBSA and CAS methods were performed to investigate the binding mechanism of binding of CR3022 against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD in order to determine their holographic dynamic information., Results: It was found that the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD complex was more stable during 100ns MD run than that of the CR3022-HCoV19-RBD system. There were common conservative amino acids on the beta2 sheet of RBD, including Tyr369, Phe377, Lys378, Tyr380, Gly381, Lys386, Leu390 and others. These conservative amino acids play significant roles in the binding process of CR3022 antibody against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD. It was also found that the binding mode of CR3022 to its native target SARS-CoV-RBD is more comprehensive and uniform. Moreover, the beta2 sheet residue Thr385 and non-beta2 sheet residues Arg408 and Asp428 of the CR3022- SARS-CoV-RBD system were found to be crucial for their binding affinities, thus forming a special conformational epitope. However, these key amino acids are not present in the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. The binding mode of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV-RBD, but the deficiency of crucial hydrogen-bonds and salt-bridges. Therefore, the binding of CR3022 and HCoV19-RBD only draws on the partial mode of the binding of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-RBD, so there is a loss of affinity., Conclusion: Thus, in order to better fight the epidemic of COVID-19 with the CR3022 antibody, this antibody needs to further improve the neutralization efficiency of HCoV-19 through mutation of it's CDR region.

0	Otolaryngologic Manifestation and Long-Term Outcome in Mild COVID-19: Experience from a Tertiary Care Centre in India. This study endeavours to comprehensively the study the spectrum of ENT manifestations in mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 and observe the natural course of anosmia and dysgeusia consequent to SARS-Cov-2 infection. A prospective cohort study was undertaken at a tertiary care centre in India on admitted patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19. Patients were included provided the baseline National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was less than 4. Patients were screened for ENT manifestations using a questionnaire at baseline, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. 225 patients were included in the study. Of these complete data at 4 weeks was available for 210. Out of 145 patients with mild COVID-19 (asymptomatic = 80), ENT manifestations accounted for 66.2% of all symptoms. Smell and taste disturbance had an overall incidence of 20% and 45% of ENT manifestations. Temporal trends of the recovery rate of anosmia and dysgeusia were 53.6% and 66.7% at 2 weeks, respectively. Corresponding rates at 3 weeks were 89.29% and 86.7%, respectively. By the end of 4 weeks 96% of the patients had recovered completely. The incidence of anosmia and dysgeusia in this study parallels the rates reported from other Asian countries, albeit, lower than the rates quoted from the Western Hemisphere. We recommend structured reporting of all ENT manifestations especially smell and taste disturbances to accurately identify individuals infected with SARS-Cov-2.

0	Incidental finding of COVID-19 infection amongst staff at a primary care facility in Ghana. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every country worldwide and all African countries. The issue of healthcare workers (HCWs) contracting the disease is a growing concern in Ghana, because of the risk of spreading infections amongst themselves and to vulnerable patients in their care. This article illustrates how 14 staff at the Korle Bu Polyclinic/Family Medicine Department were incidentally found to be Covid-19 positive with most of them being asymptomatic. This observation led to a modification of the personal protective equipment (PPE) used by clinical staff when attending to patients. Furthermore, this finding suggests that a different criteria or guideline may be needed for testing of HCWs during a pandemic where a significant proportion of infected people are asymptomatic. We conclude that in the primary care setting HCWs must be ready to see all the following cases safely: routine patients, asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and suspected COVID-19 patients.	false
0	"Modelling a pandemic with asymptomatic patients, impact of lockdown and herd immunity, with applications to SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 is a type of coronavirus that has caused the pandemic known as the Coronavirus Disease of 2019, or COVID-19. In traditional epidemiological models such as SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed), the exposed group E does not infect the susceptible group S. A distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is that, unlike with previous viral diseases, there is a distinct ""asymptomatic"" group A, which does not show any symptoms, but can nevertheless infect others, at the same rate as infected symptomatic patients. This situation is captured in a model known as SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Removed), introduced in Robinson and Stillianakis (2013). The dynamical behavior of the SAIR model is quite different from that of the SEIR model. In this paper, we use Lyapunov theory to establish the global asymptotic stabililty of the SAIR model, both without and with vital dynamics. Then we develop compartmental SAIR models to cater to the migration of population across geographic regions, and once again establish global asymptotic stability. Next, we go beyond long-term asymptotic analysis and present methods for estimating the parameters in the SAIR model. We apply these estimation methods to data from several countries including India, and demonstrate that the predicted trajectories of the disease closely match actual data. We show that ""herd immunity"" (defined as the time when the number of infected persons is maximum) can be achieved when the total of infected, symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is as low as 25% of the population. Previous estimates are typically 50% or higher. We also conclude that ""lockdown"" as a way of greatly reducing inter-personal contact has been very effective in checking the progress of the disease.

0	Ad-hoc group for Consensus recommendations of the evaluation and quality control for molecular and serological diagnostics tests for SARS CoV-2 human infection. We formulate recommendations from a consensus working group on the criteria to evaluate the diagnostic performance (size and criteria of selection of samples to determine sensitivity, analytical specificity, criteria for limit of detection, criteria for gold standard to evaluate serological assays) that should be taken into account during the evaluation and validation/verification of diagnostic tests for SARS CoV-2 infection. A national external quality control program should be established to guarantee the suitability and performance of these diagnostic serological and molecular tests during this pandemic, that will have deep implications for decisions on clinical and public health.Copyright © 2020 PeerJ Inc..

0	COVID-19 and cancer: A guide with suggested COVID-19 rule-out criteria to support clinical decision-making. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health, social and economic tolls. In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, rationale to treat the cancer or not, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Repurposing screens of FDA-approved drugs identify 29 inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally and caused serious social and economic problems. The WHO has declared this outbreak a pandemic. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs. Drugs already approved for clinical use would be ideal candidates for rapid development as COVID-19 treatments. In this work, we screened 1,473 FDA-approved drugs to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection using cell-based assays. The antiviral activity of each compound was measured based on the immunofluorescent staining of infected cells using anti-dsRNA antibody. Twenty-nine drugs were found to show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We report this new list of inhibitors to quickly provide basic information for consideration in developing potential therapies.	false
0	Structural analysis of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from an advanced vaccine candidate. Vaccine efforts against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic are focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. We performed cryo-EM and site-specific glycan analysis of one of the leading subunit vaccine candidates from Novavax based on a full-length spike protein formulated in polysorbate 80 (PS 80) detergent. Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the spike immunogen with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to published spike ectodomain structures. We also observed novel interactions between the spike trimers allowing formation of higher order spike complexes. This study confirms the structural integrity of the full-length spike protein immunogen and provides a basis for interpreting immune responses to this multivalent nanoparticle immunogen.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Estimating the percentage of a population infected with SARS-CoV-2 using the number of reported deaths: A policy planning tool. The magnitude of future waves of Covid19 in a population will depend, in part, on the percentage of that population already infected, recovered, and presumably immune. Sero-epidemiological surveys can define the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in various populations. However, sero-surveys are resource-intensive and methodologically challenging, limiting widespread use. We propose a relatively simple method for calculating the percentage of a population infected, which depends on the number of reported Covid19 deaths, a figure usually more reliable and less dependent on variable testing practices than the total number of reported Covid19 cases, and the infection fatality rate, a figure that is relatively stable in similar populations. The method can be applied in different sized areas, such as states, districts, or cities. Such an approach can provide useful, real-time estimates of probable population immunity in settings unable to undertake multiple sero-surveys. This method is applicable to low- and lower-middle-income country (LMIC) settings where sero-survey data will likely be limited; however, better estimates of infection fatality rates and Covid19 death counts in LMICs are needed to improve the method's accuracy. Information on the percentage of a population infected will help public health authorities in planning for future waves of Covid19, including where to most effectively deploy vaccines.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	A nomogram-based prediction for severe pneumonia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently ongoing worldwide. A proportion of COVID-19 patients progress rapidly to acute respiratory failure. Objective(s): We aimed to build a model to predict the risk of developing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 in the early stage. Method(s): Data from patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 and were admitted within 7 days from the onset of respiratory symptoms were retrospectively collected. The patients were classified into severe and non-severe groups according to the presence or absence of severe pneumonia during 1-2 weeks of follow-up. The clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators were screened by cross-validation based on LASSO regression to build a prediction model presented by a nomogram. The discrimination and stability, as well as the prediction performance of the model, were analysed. Result(s): The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte counts, eosinophil percentage, serum lactate dehydrogenase level and history of diabetes mellitus were collected for the model. Bootstrap resampling showed the apparent C-statistics, and the brier scores were 0.929 and 0.098. The optimism of the C-statistics and brier score was 0.0172 and -0.019, respectively. The adjusted C-statistics and brier score were 0.9108 and 0.1169, respectively. The optimal cut-off value of the total nomogram score was determined to be 119 according to the maximal Youden index. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for differentiating the presence and absence of severe pneumonia were 83%, 89%, 74%, and 94%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In our study, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte counts, eosinophil percentage, serum lactate dehydrogenase level and history of diabetes mellitus showed great discrimination and stability for the prediction of the presence of severe pneumonia and were selected for the model.Copyright © 2020 Zhang et al.	false
0	Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of common respiratory viruses in children < 2 years with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. INTRODUCTION: The advent of genome amplification assays has allowed description of new respiratory viruses and to reconsider the role played by certain respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis. This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era., METHODS: We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model., RESULTS: The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3])., CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role. Data on the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in children with acute bronchiolitis is needed., REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, CRD42018116067.	false
0	[Clinical analysis of 126 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with pharyngeal symptoms]. Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with pharyngeal symptoms. Methods: From January 10 to May 15, 2020, clinical data of 1 228 patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was collected (554 males and 674 females, with the range of age from 10 to 95 years old, the average age was 55.2 years old). The patients were divided into pharyngeal symptoms group (PS, 126 cases) and non-pharyngeal symptoms group (Non-PS, 1 102 cases) according to the presence or absence of pharyngeal symptoms such as pharyngalgia, pharyngeal dryness, pharyngeal itching, and pharyngeal foreign body sensation. The clinical data in terms of age, sex, medical history, duration of symptoms, treatment time, clinical classification, pulmonary imaging findings, whole blood cell count, serum hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin were statistically analyzed between the two groups. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The most common pharyngeal symptoms were pharyngalgia (59.52%, 75/126), followed by foreign body sensation (23.02%, 29/126), pharyngeal dryness (8.73%, 11/126), and itching (8.73%, 11/126). The median age of the patients in the PS group was 51.50 years old, which was less than 57.50 years old in the non-PS group, showing a significant difference (P<0.05). The female cases accounted for 65.08% (82/126), which was higher than 53.72% (592/1 102) of the non-PS group (P<0.05). The incidence of bilateral lung inflammation confirmed by CT images was 73.81% (93/126), which was significantly lower than 83.48% (920/1 102) in the non-PS group (P<0.05). No significant differences were shown in the proportion of patients with clinical types, treatment days, duration of symptoms, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, eosinophil count, eosinophil percentage, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin and other indicators (P>0.05). Conclusions: The incidence of pharyngeal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is 10.26%. Most of these symptoms occur before or at the same time as the common symptoms of the disease. Therefore, patients with such symptoms may bring a greater risk of infection to otolaryngologist. According to the current clinical classification criteria, pharyngeal symptoms have no obvious correlation with the degree of the disease; but the presence of pharyngeal symptoms may suggest a milder clinical presentation and a better prognosis.	false
0	Antibody potency, effector function, and combinations in protection and therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has been responsible for over 42 million infections and 1 million deaths since its emergence in December 2019. There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines. Here, we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 and in a mouse-adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). Antibody combinations were effective for prevention and in therapy when administered early. However, in vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo protection, and some hu-mAbs were more protective in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors contributes to optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA. The data indicate that intact effector function can affect hu-mAb protective activity and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention.

0	[Six cases of acute pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19]. Rising from the province of Wuhan in China, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 broke out in winter 2019, causing a global pandemic. In most cases reported, COVID-19 symptoms include cough, dyspnea, myalgia and asthenia. In some cases, the disease can also cause severe respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to thromboembolic event such as pulmonary embolism. Moreover, there is an overlap between signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and COVID-19, which brings a challenge for the diagnosis and could potentially be fatal. Nevertheless, the incidence rate of pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19 is currently not known. In this paper we describe six cases of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19.	false
0	Computed tomography characterization and outcome evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by venous thromboembolism. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is frequently complicated by venous thromboembolism (VTE). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest-primarily usually conducted as low-dose, non-contrast enhanced CT-plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. Performed as contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography, it can reliably detect or rule-out pulmonary embolism (PE). Several imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia have been described for chest CT, but no study evaluated CT findings in the context of VTE/PE., PURPOSE: In our retrospective study, we analyzed clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics of 50 consecutive patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT at two tertiary care medical centers., MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia and contrast-enhanced chest CT performed at two tertiary care hospitals between March 1st and April 20th 2020 were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), symptoms, date of symptom onset, RT-PCR results, imaging results of CT and leg ultrasound, laboratory findings (C-reactive protein, differential blood count, troponine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen, interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase muscle-brain (CKmb) and lactate,) and patient outcome (positive: discharge or treatment on normal ward; negative: treatment on intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or death) were analyzed. Follow-up was performed until May 10th. Patients were assigned to two groups according to two endpoints: venous thromboembolism (VTE) or no VTE. For statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression models were calculated., RESULTS: This study includes 50 patients. In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), pulmonary embolism was detected at contrast-enhanced chest CT. The majority of PE was detected on CTs performed on day 11-20 after symptom onset. Two patients (14%) with PE simultaneously had evidence of deep vein thrombosis. 15 patients (30%) had a negative outcome (need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death), and 35 patients (70%) had a positive outcome (transfer to regular ward, or discharge). Patients suffering VTE had a statistically significant higher risk of an unfavorable outcome (p = 0.028). In univariate analysis, two imaging characteristics on chest CT were associated with VTE: crazy paving pattern (p = 0.024) and air bronchogram (n = 0.021). Also, elevated levels of NT-pro BNP (p = 0.043), CK (p = 0.023) and D-dimers (p = 0.035) were significantly correlated with VTE., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia is frequently complicated by pulmonary embolism (incidence of 28% in our cohort), remarkably with lacking evidence of deep vein thrombosis in nearly all thus affected patients of our cohort. As patients suffering VTE had an adverse outcome, we call for a high level of alertness for PE and advocate a lower threshold for contrast-enhanced CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. According to our observations, this might be particularly justified in the second week of disease and if a crazy paving pattern and / or air bronchogram is present on previous non-enhanced CT.	false
0	Diagnostic accuracy of serological tests and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: A systematic review and meta-analysis. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) serological test methods and the kinetics of antibody positivity. Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. We included articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests and the kinetics of antibody positivity. MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, medRxiv and bioRxiv were sources of articles. Methodological qualities of included articles were appraised using QUADAS-2 while Metandi performs bivariate meta-analysis of DTA using a generalized linear mixed-model approach. Stata 14 and Review Manager 5.3 were used for data analysis. The summary sensitivity/specificity of chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) were 92% (95% CI: 86%-95%)/99% (CI: 97%-99%), 86% (CI: 82%-89%)/99% (CI: 98%-100%) and 78% (CI: 71%-83%)/98% (95% CI: 96%-99%), respectively. Moreover, CLIA-based assays produced nearly 100% sensitivity within 11-15 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Based on antibody type, the sensitivity of ELISA-total antibody, CLIA-IgM/G and CLIA-IgG gauged at 94%, 92% and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity of CLIA-RBD assay reached 96%, while LFIA-S demonstrated the lowest sensitivity, 71% (95% CI: 58%-80%). CLIA assays targeting antibodies against RBD considered the best DTA. The antibody positivity rate increased corresponding with DPSO, but there was some decrement when moving from acute phase to convalescent phase of infection. As immunoglobulin isotope-related DTA was heterogeneous, our data have insufficient evidence to recommend CLIA/ELISA for clinical decision-making, but likely to have comparative advantage over RT-qPCR in certain circumstances and geographic regions.	false
0	COVID-19 hospital outbreaks: Protecting healthcare workers to protect frail patients. An Italian observational cohort study. OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among exposed HCWs after preventive protocol implementation., METHODS: 5750 HCWs. Those in contact with COVID-19 patients were allocated into a high-risk or a low-risk group based on contact type (PPE- or non-PPE-protected); high risk workers underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests, while for low-risk workers swab tests were carried out only for symptomatic workers (active surveillance). The prevalence was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples., RESULTS: 3570 HCWs had contact with 1065 COVID-19 patients. Among them, 3494 were subjected to active surveillance (low-risk group); 2886 (82.60%) were subjected to a swab test and 15 were positive (0.52%). 76 HCWs (2.13% of exposed) were included in the high-risk group, and a swab test was mandatory for each participant. Overall, 66 (86.84% of high-risk) were negative, and 10 positive (13.16%), resulting in a higher risk of infection than in the low-risk group [OR = 29.00; 95% CI:12.56-66.94; p < 0.0001]., CONCLUSION: To date, the SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence is 0.70% among exposed HCWs and 0.435% among all HCWs working at the examined university hospital. The correct use of PPE and the early identification of symptomatic workers are essential factors to avoiding nosocomial clusters. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Clinical course and potential predictive factors for pneumonia of adult patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A retrospective observational analysis of 193 confirmed cases in Thailand. Clinical spectrum of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to describe the clinical course and final outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the full spectrum of disease severity. We also aimed to identify potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. The median (IQR) incubation period was 5.5 (3.0-8.0) days. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in 189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was 39%. The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to pneumonia detection was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days. Bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia. In multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR 2.55 per 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.67-3.90; p<0.001), obesity (OR 8.74; 95%CI, 2.06-37.18; p = 0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.59 per 1degreeC increase from 37.2degreeC; 95% CI, 2.30-9.17; p<0.001) were potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Across the spectrum of disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in our cohort had good final clinical outcomes. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of them. Older age, obesity, and higher fever at presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia.	false
0	Independent side-by-side validation and comparison of four serological platforms for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Highly sensitive and specific platforms for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are becoming increasingly important for (1) evaluating potential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors, (2) studying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and (3) identifying individuals with seroconversion. This study provides a comparative validation of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 platforms. Unique feature of this study is the use of a representative cohort of COVID-19-convalescent patients with mild-to-moderate disease course. All platforms showed significant correlations with a SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction-neutralization test, with highest sensitivities for the Euroimmun and the Roche platforms, suggesting their preferential use for screening of persons at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Request of hospital care dropped for TIA but remained stable for stroke during COVID-19 pandemic at a large Italian university hospital. Reduced incidence of stroke during COVID-19 pandemic was sometimes reported. While decrease in stroke incidence and fear of patients to go to the hospitals were sometimes invoked to explain this decrease, reduction in urban pollution was also hypothesized as a possible cause. We investigated statistically the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and of transient ischemic attacks, at a large Italian tertiary stroke center during the pandemic. We analyzed statistically the number of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), ischemic strokes (IS) and hemorrhagic strokes (HS) between March 8 and May 2, 2020, the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and compared them with the identical period of 2019. We also analyzed the concentration of small particulate matter (PM10) in 2019 and 2020, to see if it could account for modified incidence of strokes or TIA. We found a large, significant drop in TIA (-51%) during the pandemic compared to the same period of 2019. By contrast, the number of HS was identical, and IS showed a not significant -24% decrease. PM10 concentration, already low in 2019, did not further decrease in 2020. Patients kept seeking hospital care when experiencing permanent neurological symptoms (stroke), but they tended not go to the hospital when their symptoms were transient (TIA). The fact that we did not observe a significant decrease in strokes may be explained by the fact that in our city the concentration of small particulate matter did not change compared to 2019.	false
0	The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health. Background: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. Method(s): Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; >=4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; >=4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. Result(s): The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). Conclusion(s): The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Deaths From COVID-19 in Rural, Micropolitan, and Metropolitan Areas: A County-Level Comparison. PURPOSE: The United States has experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas. Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States., METHODS: This study used county-level data. The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics. The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC. Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19. The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020., FINDINGS: After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70.3% (P < .001) for rural counties and 53.4% (P < .001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period., CONCLUSION: Over time, rural geography and social isolation may not provide sustainable protection to rural residents from the pandemic. The slow progression provides rural areas additional time and opportunity to learn from the experiences in urban areas that were most affected. Rural areas need to be proactive and develop prevention strategies and response plans to manage and control the spread of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 National Rural Health Association.	false
0	Brain Diffusion Tensor Imaging Findings in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can evaluate microstructural brain involvement in various diseases. We aimed to investigate whether there were any DTI differences in patients with HT, and the relationship between DTI values and disease duration time and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) levels., METHODS: We prospectively included 36 patients with HT (mean age 41.6 +/- 13.8 years, range 18-64 years) and 18 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects (mean age 41.6 +/- 13.1 years, range 18-63 years). All patients were euthyroid at the time of imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values of 15 distinct neuroanatomical locations were measured and compared., RESULTS: FA values of the patients with HT were lower in cingulum, globus pallidus (GP), cerebellar white matter (CWM) than the control (P = .019, .002, and <.001, respectively). MD values of the CWM in patients were higher than the control (P = .008). AD values of patients with HT were lower in the cingulum, posterior limbs of the internal capsule, GP, and putamen (P = .038, .038, .030, and .045, respectively). RD values of cingulum and CWM in HT were higher than controls (P <.001 and P = .011, respectively). There was a negative relationship between the FA values of PLIC and a positive relationship between the MD values of the corona radiata and TPOAb levels were detected., CONCLUSIONS: The current DTI study presented microstructural changes in the neurocognitive-related areas that may be related to accompanying neurological findings in HT.

0	Impact of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been associated with unfavourable pregnancy outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the human coronavirus family, and since this infection shows a pandemic trend it will involve many pregnant women., AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on maternal and neonatal outcomes., SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 8th May 2020. Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19., CONTENT: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70-100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1-20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72-94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0-6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates had a positive nasopharyngeal swab; one out of five neonates had elevated concentrations of serum IgM and IgG, but a negative swab., IMPLICATIONS: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, COVID-19 should not be considered as an indication for elective caesarean section. Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

0	Post Exposure Prophylaxis with Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the Prevention of COVID-19, a Myth or a Reality? The PEP-CQ Study. BACK GROUND: Since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic many available drugs have been tried for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 with limited success or failure. The household direct contacts of the COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 in the view of its in-vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is still inconclusive and evolving., METHOD: In this open label control clinical trial asymptomatic individual who had direct contact with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in last 2 weeks were given the option for taking HCQ prophylaxis and assigned into PEP (N=132) and control groups (N=185). The PEP group received tablet HCQ 800 mg on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both the groups received standard care of therapy in the form of home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene and followed up for 4 weeks for new onset COVID-19., RESULTS: Total 50 out of 317 participants (15.8%) had new onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.033) lower in PEP group [N=14 out of 132, (10.6%)] as compared to the control group [N=36 out of 185, (19.4%)]. Total absolute risk reduction for the incidence of COVID-19 was -8.8% points. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent occurrence of one case of COVID-19 was 12. The overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 1.05). The compliance was good and most common ADR was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation, reported by 3 participants and no serious ADR was noted., CONCLUSION: PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Till definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals for the prevention of COVID-19, as endorsed by many national/international health authorities. The present study will encourage the researchers around the globe to reconsider further randomized clinical trials with larger sample size for better evaluation of HCQ as PEP for the prevention of COVID-19., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov PRS ID: CT04408456.

0	Evaluating the Quality of Rigid Optic Videolaryngoscopy Image Taken Through Dental Protection Cap and Its Feasibility as Additional Barrier Method Against COVID-19. Videolaryngoscopy screening is essential to help assessing human larynx. The use of 70degree optical fiber in association with image recording by analog or digital cameras is one of the methods adopted to perform this examination. Endoscopic exams can contaminate the equipment with several microorganisms. The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus reinforces the importance of developing efficient barrier methods to be adopted in videolaryngoscopy procedures. Although dental intraoral camera covers are a barrier method authorized by Brazilian health organs, it has not yet been used in videolaryngoscopy examinations. The aim of the current longitudinal, individualized, single-blind, prospective, self-controlled, and accurate study is to evaluate the quality of images generated through, and confidence level of, diagnosis based on videolaryngoscopy performed with intraoral dental camera equipped with disposable protection cap and connected to 70degree rigid laryngoscope in vocally healthy individuals. Videolaryngoscopy examinations based on 70degree rigid optics were performed in 13 euphonic and asymptomatic volunteers at an otorhinolaryngology specialist clinic; only 1 patient was excluded from the study. Images were taken with, and without, disposable intraoral dental camera protection cap; high-grade disinfection protocol was applied between examinations. Recorded videos were randomly distributed in a single-blind manner in order to be evaluated by four otorhinolaryngologists, who answered a questionnaire comprising three questions. Statistical analysis was used to compare groups - which were defined by the use, or not, of protection cap - based on Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Statistical significance was set at 5% with 95% confidence interval. There was no statistically significant difference in image quality between examinations performed with, and without, protection cap (P= 0.646) or in the diagnosis confidence level of examinations performed with, or without, the barrier method. The use of disposable protection cap on intraoral dental camera did not significantly change the quality of images taken through videolaryngoscopy performed with 70degree rigid optics in vocally healthy patients.

0	How should we use convalescent plasma therapies for COVID-19?. Convalescent plasma (CP) from blood donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may benefit patients with COVID-19 by providing immediate passive immunity via transfusion, or when used to manufacture hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations. Optimal product characteristics (including neutralizing antibody titers), volume of transfusion, and timing of administration remain to be determined. Preliminary safety data for COVID-19 CP are encouraging, but establishing the clinical efficacy of CP requires recruitment of patients to high-quality randomized trials and an ongoing international collaborative effort.

0	Longitudinal characterization of the IgM and IgG humoral response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients using the Abbott Architect. BACKGROUND: Antibody testing has recently emerged as an option to assist with determining exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Elucidation of the kinetics and duration of the humoral response is important for clinical management and interpreting results from serological surveys., OBJECTIVES: Here we evaluated the clinical performance of Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays, as well as the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients., STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: The diagnostic specificity was 100 % for IgM and 99.67 % for IgG using 300 pre-COVID-19 serum specimens. Using 1349 sequential serum samples collected up to 168 days post symptom onset from 427 PCR-confirmed individuals, clinical test sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay was 24.6 % at <=7 days, 75.3 % at 8-14 days, 95.0 % at 15-21 days, and 96.0 % at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgM seroconversion was 10 days. IgM levels declined steadily 4-5 weeks after symptom onset, and the positive rate dropped to 30.8 % at >3 months. The diagnostic sensitivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay post symptom onset was 23.2 % at <=7 days, 69.5 % at 8-14 days, 93.6 % at 15-21 days, and 99.6 % at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgG seroconversion was 11.5 days. During the convalescent phase of the infection, a decline in the IgG level was observed in patients who were followed for >100 days. Despite that decline, 92.3 % of the patient cohort remained IgG positive 3-6 months following symptom onset., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the Abbott IgM assay against SARS-CoV-2 is detected slightly earlier compared to IgG, with both tests exhibiting excellent overall sensitivity and specificity. In symptomatic patients who test negative by PCR for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, assessing IgM and IgG antibodies can aid in supporting a diagnosis of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Universal influenza vaccines: Shifting to better vaccines. Influenza virus causes acute upper and lower respiratory infections and is the most likely, among known pathogens, to cause a large epidemic in humans. Influenza virus mutates rapidly, enabling it to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Furthermore, influenza viruses can cross from animals to humans, generating novel, potentially pandemic strains. Currently available influenza vaccines induce a strain specific response and may be ineffective against new influenza viruses. The difficulty in predicting circulating strains has frequently resulted in mismatch between the annual vaccine and circulating viruses. Low-resource countries remain mostly unprotected against seasonal influenza and are particularly vulnerable to future pandemics, in part, because investments in vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling are concentrated in high-resource countries. Antibodies that target conserved sites in the hemagglutinin stalk have been isolated from humans and shown to confer protection in animal models, suggesting that broadly protective immunity may be possible. Several innovative influenza vaccine candidates are currently in preclinical or early clinical development. New technologies include adjuvants, synthetic peptides, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vectors, messenger RNA, viral vectors, and attenuated or inactivated influenza viruses. Other approaches target the conserved exposed epitope of the surface exposed membrane matrix protein M2e. Well-conserved influenza proteins, such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein, are mainly targeted for developing strong cross-protective T cell responses. With multiple vaccine candidates moving along the testing and development pipeline, the field is steadily moving toward a product that is more potent, durable, and broadly protective than previously licensed vaccines.Copyright © 2016 World Health Organization.	false
0	The rationale for potential pharmacotherapy of covid-19. On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Detection of respiratory viruses in gargle specimens of healthy children. Background: Respiratory tract viral infection is one of the most common and important diseases in children. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are often used to detect viruses in samples, it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of PCR positivity, which may reflect a past, imminent or active asymptomatic infection due to their high sensitivity. Although single respiratory viruses have been detected in samples from children with symptoms, other respiratory viruses can also be detected simultaneously. However, the clinical importance of these findings for the symptoms is not known. Objective(s): To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children without any symptoms such as acute respiratory illness and/or fever. Study design: From week twenty-five 2013 to week twenty-six 2014, gargle samples were collected from children once a week and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect respiratory viruses. On each sampling day, we asked the parents about their children's health condition. Result(s): Among the 286 samples collected, 200 were from asymptomatic children. In the asymptomatic condition, human parechovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E and HKU1 were observed in 45 episodes. In samples from symptomatic children, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC43 were detected in addition to those mentioned above. Conclusion(s): Various viruses of different species were detected in the specimens from the children regardless of their health status. It might be speculated that host factors such as the function of the immune system influence the clinical outcome of the infection. However, this needs to be studied further.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Ribosome display technology: Applications in disease diagnosis and control. Antibody ribosome display remains one of the most successful in vitro selection technologies for antibodies fifteen years after it was developed. The unique possibility of direct generation of whole proteins, particularly single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs), has facilitated the establishment of this technology as one of the foremost antibody production methods. Ribosome display has become a vital tool for efficient and low-cost production of antibodies for diagnostics due to its advantageous ability to screen large libraries and generate binders of high affinity. The remarkable flexibility of this method enables its applicability to various platforms. This review focuses on the applications of ribosome display technology in biomedical and agricultural fields in the generation of recombinant scFvs for disease diagnostics and control.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	A practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma in patients with severe COVID-19 in developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected 187 countries, representing a global public health problem. The increasing number of critically ill patients and deaths have fueled a desperate search for treatments that can halt the course of the disease. Currently, there are several experimental therapies with demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19 used in clinical practice, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and convalescent plasma; however, to date no agent has proven efficacy against COVID-19. In the case of convalescent plasma, this therapy consists in obtaining neutralizing antibodies from previously infected individuals by plasmapheresis and administering them to patients with severe disease. Recently, the use of convalescent plasma has shown promising results in preliminary studies, with case series reporting a decrease in temperature, and viral load, as well as improvement in clinical parameters among patients receiving this treatment. However, there are still unmet needs regarding the safety profile, tolerability, dosage, and timing this therapy should be given. Based on this, the objective of our study was to develop and propose a practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, given the constrains and limitations of developing countries. We encourage health professionals in developing countries to use the current evidence and approaches to experimental treatments for patients with COVID-19, adapting them to their conditions, and always based on a thorough risk-benefit evaluation for each patient, and whenever possible to design and promote the much needed research in this field.Copyright © 2020 Sabando Velez et al.

0	Discovery of sandwich type COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein DNA aptamers. Here, we report for the first time DNA aptamers targeted toward the COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein (Np). Np is one of the most abundant structural proteins and it serves as a diagnostic marker for the accurate and sensitive detection of COVID-19. After five rounds of selection, we obtained four DNA sequences with an affinity below 5 nM. The best one displayed a superb binding performance toward Np with a Kd value of 0.49 nM. Interestingly, we found that the four pairs of aptamers could bind to Np successively, suggesting a sandwich-type interaction. Using these sandwiched aptamers in ELISA and colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips, we were able to detect Np at the tens of pM level. The results demonstrate that aptamers are powerful molecular tools for virus detection, diagnosis, and antiviral therapy. This journal isCopyright © The Royal Society of Chemistry.	false
0	Impact of Routine Infant BCG Vaccination on COVID-19. Objectives: In Japan, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on January 15, 2020 and subsequent infections rapidly increased. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread. Method(s): Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, annual routine infant BCG vaccine coverage (represented by the number of BCG vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result(s): The BCG vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no COVID-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with BCG vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20-34 and 40-54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that routine infant BCG vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local COVID-19 spread in Japan.Copyright © 2020 The British Infection Association	false
0	Seasonal human coronavirus antibodies are boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection but not associated with protection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread within the human population. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies in serum samples collected from 204 humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ~23% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but paradoxically these hCoV cross-reactive antibodies were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	COVID 19 mortality: Probable role of microbiome to explain disparity. There is a significant difference between COVID 19 associated mortality between different countries. Generally the number of deaths per million population are higher in the developed countries despite better health care efficiency, drinking water quality and expected healthy life span (HALE) at the time of birth. Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome. There might be a need to look at dynamics of COVID 19 pandemic using immune perspective. The approach can potentially inform better policies including interventions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Induction of self-reactive T cells after murine coronavirus infection. We studied the mechanism of in vitro spontaneous lymphokine production by spleen cells from mice injected intraperitoneally with murine coronavirus strain JHM 1 month after infection, when infectious virus had already been cleared from the spleens. Removal of either CD4+ T cells or Ia+ antigen-presenting cells (APC) from the spleen cells abrogated interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Addition of anti-CD4 or anti-Ia(d) monoclonal antibodies to the culture suppressed IL-2 production. These results suggest that the response involved typical receptor-mediated activation of T cells. Surprisingly, reciprocal mixing experiments with a coculture of T cells from infected mice and APC from either infected or naive mice resulted in the production of IL-2. The absence of viral antigens in spleen cells 1 month after infection, as indicated by their inability to induce the proliferation of T-cell clones specific for the viral antigens, suggest that the T cells from mice 1 month after infection were not responding to the viral antigens. The inoculum components other than the virus did not induce this immune response. We also found that the frequency of self-reactive but not alloreactive IL-2-producing T cells in the spleens of infected mice was 3- to 10-fold higher than that in naive mice. These findings suggest that an increased frequency of self-reactive T cells which secrete IL-2 occurs following murine coronavirus infection. This may have important implications in the development of autoimmunelike phenomena following murine coronavirus infection.	false
0	Considerations for Pregnant Dental and Health Care Workers amid COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease that quickly reached pandemic levels. Over 5 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 330,000 deaths have been recorded worldwide. Transmission is primarily spread through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets, the mouth, and/or nose secretions. Health care professionals (HCPs), including dental HCPs, are recognized to be at considerably high risk for infection due to the close proximity to patients and aerosol-generating procedures. During pregnancy, HCPs may be at even higher risk since pregnancy substantially increases the susceptibility to infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE(S): Here, we present the posed risks and potential effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal health. Current prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 on pregnant dental and HCPs are also discussed. RESULT(S): Significant progress is being made in understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of COVID-19. Pregnant women are affected more adversely with viral illnesses, although evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 is controversial. Based on the presence of atypical symptoms, the significant numbers of asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive, and the high susceptibility to viral diseases observed in pregnant women, recommendations have been put forth to limit the exposure of COVID-19-positive or even suspected cases to pregnant HCPs, and these are likely to evolve as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION(S): Pregnant HCPs require extra caution: not only are they considered a high-risk population, but their work at the frontline in a pandemic may expose them to additional risks. Complete awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal/infant health, as well as prevention and management guidelines for pregnant HCPs, will allow for a safer work environment. Health care institutional policies aimed at protecting pregnant HCPs should consider avoiding their assignment as first responders, especially if equally trained staff are available. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Dental and health care professionals can use the information in this review to improve their awareness of COVID-19 risks, signs, and symptoms and the associated effects on the health of pregnant health care professionals and their unborn/newborn children.	false
0	Effect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on the U.S. Emergency Medical Services System: A Preliminary Report. Background: Our objective was to quantify trends in emergency medical services (EMS) incidents as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States and to determine if there was an increase in EMS-attended deaths. Method(s): We conducted a 3-year comparative retrospective cohort analysis of data from the National EMS Information System. Data were included if care was provided between the 40th and 21st weeks of the next year and compared over 3 years. We included incidents identified through 9-1-1 where patient contact was made. The total number of EMS incidents per week was used as the denominator to calculate the rate of patient deaths and possible injury. We assessed for temporal and seasonal trends. Result(s): Starting in the 10th week of 2020 there was a decrease in the number of EMS activations in the United States compared to the prior weeks and the same time period in previous years. The number of activations between week 10 and week 16 decreased by 140,292 or 26.1%. The portion of EMS activations reporting a patient disposition of death nearly doubled between the 11th and 15th weeks of 2020 (1.49%-2.77% of all activations). The number of EMS activations documenting a possible injury decreased from 18.43% to 15.27% between weeks 10 and 13. Conclusion(s): We found that early in the COVID-19 outbreak there was a significant decrease in the number of EMS responses across the United States. Simultaneously the rate of EMS-attended death doubled, while the rate of injuries decreased.Copyright © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine	false
0	COVID 19 - Clinical picture in the elderly population: A qualitative systematic review. The SARS-CoV-2 tendency to affect the older individuals more severely, raises the need for a concise summary isolating this age population. Analysis of clinical features in light of most recently published data allows for improved understanding, and better clinical judgement. A thorough search was performed to collect all articles published from 1st of January to 1st of June 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 followed by the generic terms elderly, older adults or older individuals. The quality assessment of studies and findings was performed by an adaptation of the STROBE statement and CERQual approach. Excluding duplicates, a total of 1598 articles were screened, of which 20 studies were included in the final analysis, pertaining to 4965 older COVID-19 patients (>=60 years old). Variety in symptoms was observed, with fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, or sputum production being the most common. Prominent changes in laboratory findings consistently indicated lymphopenia and inflammation and in some cases organ damage. Radiological examination reveals ground glass opacities with occasional consolidations, bilaterally, with a possible peripheral tendency. An evident fraction of the elderly population (25.7%) developed renal injury or impairment as a complication. Roughly 71.4% of the older adults require supplementary oxygen, while invasive mechanical ventilation was required in almost a third of the reported hospitalized older individuals. In this review, death occurred in 20.0% of total patients with a recorded outcome (907/4531). Variability in confidence of findings is documented. Variety in symptom presentation is to be expected, and abnormalities in laboratory findings are present. Risk for mortality is evident, and attention to the need for supplementary oxygen and possible mechanical ventilation is advised. Further data is required isolating this age population. Presented literature may allow for the construction of better predictive models of COVID-19 in older populations.Copyright © 2020 Neumann-Podczaska A et al.

0	Compare the epidemiological and clinical features of imported and local COVID-19 cases in Hainan, China. Background: Effective management of imported cases is an important part of epidemic prevention and control. Hainan Province, China reported 168 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including 112 imported cases on February 19, 2020, but successfully contained the epidemic within 1 month. We described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Hainan and compared these features between imported and local cases to provide information for other international epidemic areas. Method(s): We included 91 patients (56 imported and 35 local cases) from two designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Haikou, China, from January 20 to February 19, 2020. Data on the demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from medical records. Patients were followed until April 21, 2020, and the levels of antibodies at the follow-ups were also analysed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. Result(s): Of the 91 patients, 78 (85.7%) patients were diagnosed within the first three weeks after the first case was identified (Day 1: Jan 22, 2020), while the number of local cases started to increase during the third week. No new cases occurred after Day 29. Fever and cough were two main clinical manifestations. In total, 15 (16.5%) patients were severe, 14 (15.4%) had complicated infections, nine (9.9%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and three died. The median duration of viral shedding in feces was longer than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (19 days vs 16 days, P = 0.007). Compared with local cases, imported cases were older and had a higher incidence of fever and concurrent infections. There was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. IgG was positive in 92.8% patients (77/83) in the follow-up at week 2 after discharge, while 88.4% patients (38/43) had a reduction in IgG levels in the follow-up at week 4 after discharge, and the median level was lower than that in the follow-up at week 2 (10.95 S/Cut Off (S/CO) vs 15.02 S/CO, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Imported cases were more severe than local cases but had similar prognoses. The level of IgG antibodies declined from week 6 to week 8 after onset. The short epidemic period in Hainan suggests that the epidemic could be quickly brought under control if proper timely measures were taken.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregate formation trigger tissue factor expression in patients with severe COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus has rapidly achieved pandemic proportions causing remarkably increased morbidity and mortality around the world. A hypercoagulability state has been reported as a major pathologic event in COVID-19, and thromboembolic complications listed among life-threatening complications of the disease. Platelets are chief effector cells of hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. However, the participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains elusive. This report demonstrates that increased platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregate formation are observed in severe COVID-19 patients, but not in patients presenting mild COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, exposure to plasma from severe COVID-19 patients increased the activation of control platelets ex vivo. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, platelet-monocyte interaction was strongly associated with tissue factor (TF) expression by the monocytes. Platelet activation and monocyte TF expression were associated with markers of coagulation exacerbation as fibrinogen and D-dimers, and were increased in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or patients who evolved with in-hospital mortality. Finally, platelets from severe COVID-19 patients were able to induce TF expression ex vivo in monocytes from healthy volunteers, a phenomenon that was inhibited by platelet P-selectin neutralization or integrin alphaIIb/beta3 blocking with the aggregation inhibitor abciximab. Altogether, these data shed light on new pathological mechanisms involving platelet activation and platelet-dependent monocyte TF expression, which were associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.Copyright © 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.	false

0	Covid-19 and SLE-what do we know today?. Six months following the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic in China, data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases are now available. However, the rapid spread of the pandemic has not allowed proper design of prospective studies, thus evidence came mostly from case series and observational studies. The early enthusiasm on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) antiviral properties should not suggest that patients who are longterm treated with antimalarials, such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, a French report on 17 HCQ-treated SLE patients dampened the enthusiasm.1 A recent report from Covid-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance has described 80 SLE patients with Covid-19, mostly females under 65 years of age, 64% of whom were already taking HCQ before the infection: the rate of hospitalisation and the need for intensive care did not differ between patients who were and those who were not taking HCQ.2 A study group from Northern Italy - the Italian epicentre of the pandemic - reported an incidence of 2.5% of Covid-19 (higher compared to the general population of the same region) in 165 patients with SLE.3 Patients with SLE are possibly at risk of developing symptomatic or severe Covid-19, not only because of their disease or treatment but as a consequence of associated comorbidities known to worsen the outcome of SARS-COv-2 infection. 4 5 What do we know so far? SLE patients should not withdraw their medication. Before drawing any other conclusion, large registry data are needed to clarify the incidence and the outcome of Covid-19 in patients with SLE.	false
0	Home Management of Children With COVID-19 in the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. In most children, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild or moderate disease. Moreover, in a relevant number of cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains totally asymptomatic. All these findings seem to suggest that otherwise healthy children with suspected COVID-19 might be managed in the community in most cases, thus avoiding hospital admission and closely related medical, social and economic problems, including overwhelming hospitals. Unfortunately, home management of children with suspected COVID-19 rarely occurs, and many children with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are frequently hospitalized irrespective of the severity of disease. To evaluate the role of community health houses (CHHs) in the management of children with COVID-19, 1,009 children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were studied in Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. Among them, 194 (19.2%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority (583, 58%) were tested at home by CHHs, while 426 (42%) were brought to the hospital for testing. The patients who were managed in the hospital had a significantly lower median age than those who were managed at home (2 vs. 12 years, p < 0.001). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases within the family was significantly more frequent among those who were managed at home (82 vs. 46%, p < 0.05). The clinical findings were similar between the children who were managed at home and those who were managed in the hospital. Only one of the children managed at home (0.7%) required hospitalization; in comparison, 26 (48%) of those whose swab samples were taken at the hospital were hospitalized. Our research shows for the first time the importance of CHHs in the management of COVID-19 in children; because of the high frequency of mild to moderate cases, management by CHHs can reduce the care load in hospitals, providing enormous advantages on the familial, medical, social, and economic levels. These findings could be useful for suggesting a territorial rather than hospital-based strategy in pediatrics in the case of a new wave of the epidemic.

0	Anxiety and Depression Among People Under the Nationwide Partial Lockdown in Vietnam. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological effects of the partial lockdown on the people in Vietnam during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire regarding attitudes toward COVID-19 along with psychological parameters, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was conducted. From a total of 1,382 questionnaires, the respondents reported low prevalence of depression (4.9%), anxiety (7.0%), and stress (3.4%). The mean DASS-21 scores recorded were also markedly lower compared to similar studies conducted in China, Italy, and Iran. Respondents who reported severe PTSD had significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Factors that were associated with an increased level of depression, stress, and anxiety were being single, separated, or widowed, a higher education level, a larger family size, loss of jobs and being in contact with potential COVID-19 patients. Contrary to expectations, the level of depression, stress, and anxiety observed has been low. Our findings can aid in future research on the impact of a partial lockdown and guide mental health professionals in Vietnam and other countries in the preparation of better care for populations under such circumstances.

0	COVID-19 and Sick Leave: An Analysis of the Ibermutua Cohort of Over 1,651,305 Spanish Workers in the First Trimester of 2020. Objectives: The worldwide SARS-COV2 pandemic has impacted the health of workers and companies. The aim is to quantify it according to sick leave. Methods: Using ICD-9 codes, we analyzed Ibermutua records of all sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020, compared to during the same months of 2017, 2018, and 2019. We stratified the analysis by causes, patient sex, activity sectors, and regional data. All sick leaves were adjusted by the number of Ibermutua-affiliated persons in each period. Results: In March 2020, there was an unprecedented (116%) increase in total sick leaves, mainly due to infectious and respiratory diseases. Men and women were equally affected. All activity sectors were impacted, with the highest increase (457%) observed among health-related workers, especially due to contagious disease. The incidences of sick leaves were heterogeneous among different regions. Cost-analysis of sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020 compared with in previous years showed 40.3% increment (mean 2,813 vs. 2,005  per 100 affiliated workers). Conclusions: The SARS-COV2 pandemic is having a huge impact on workers' health, as shown by data regarding sick leaves in March 2020. This is associated with greater economic burden for companies, both due to the cost associated with sick leaves and the losses in productivity due to confinement.

0	Implementing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review. Introduction: For the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) response, COVID-19 antigen (Ag), and antibody (Ab) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are expected to complement central molecular testing particularly in low-resource settings. The present review assesses requirements for implementation of COVID-19 RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was <= 30degreeC for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network. Discussion/Conclusion:  Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa. Copyright © 2020 Jacobs, Kuhne, Lunguya, Affolabi, Hardy and Vandenberg.	false
0	"Why ""good enough"" is not good enough: scientific data, not supply chain deficiencies, should be driving Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Obstetricians and clinicians previously requested clarification from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the need for full personal protective equipment including N95 respirators during the second stage of labor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded with new guidance excluding the second stage of labor from its list of aerosol-generating procedures based on research from which experience on labor and delivery units was notably absent. Additional literature that explores other modes of aerosol generation, such as coughing, vomiting, passing flatus, and loud vocalization, all of which are prevalent during the labor course, was notably omitted. It is clear that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based their guidance not from the application of scientific principles but from pragmatism owing to the lack of equipment, and our colleagues were urged to follow suit. If we replace recommendations based on scientific principles with recommendations based on supply chain deficiencies, we become complacent with that which is ""good enough under the circumstances."" This is a dangerous precedent on which to base our professional society guidelines. We should continue to address these inadequate responses even as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines evolve and the pandemic winds down. We will certainly face similar conflict again, whether during a fall resurgence of the current pandemic or a future infectious disease outbreak.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc."	false

0	Prospects of nanomaterials-enabled biosensors for COVID-19 detection. We are currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic which is the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Since no specific vaccines or drugs have been developed till date for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, early diagnosis is essential to further combat this pandemic. In this context, the reliable, rapid, and low-cost technique for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is the foremost priority. At present reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference technique presently being used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in a number of cases, false results have been noticed in COVID-19 diagnosis. To develop advanced techniques, researchers are continuously working and in the series of constant efforts, nanomaterials-enabled biosensing approaches can be a hope to offer novel techniques that may perhaps meet the current demand of fast and early diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. This paper provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic and nanomaterials-enabled biosensing approaches that have been recently reported for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Though limited studies on the development of nanomaterials enabled biosensing techniques for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, this review summarizes nanomaterials mediated improved biosensing strategies and the possible mechanisms that may be responsible for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease. It is reviewed that nanomaterials e.g. gold nanostructures, lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (NPs), graphene and iron oxide NPs can be potentially used to develop advanced techniques offered by colorimetric, amperometric, impedimetric, fluorescence, and optomagnetic based biosensing of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, critical issues that are likely to accelerate the development of nanomaterials-enabled biosensing for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been discussed in detail. This review may serve as a guide for the development of advanced techniques for nanomaterials enabled biosensing to fulfill the present demand of low-cost, rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Characterization of neutralizing antibody with prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys. Efficacious interventions are urgently needed for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody (mAb), MW05, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity by disrupting the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Crosslinking of Fc with FcgammaRIIB mediates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity by MW05. This activity is eliminated by introducing the LALA mutation to the Fc region (MW05/LALA). Potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 are observed in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of MW05/LALA blocks infection of SARS-CoV-2 in prophylactic treatment and clears SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a therapeutic treatment setting. These results pave the way for the development of MW05/LALA as an antiviral strategy for COVID-19.	false
0	CoVaccine HT TM Adjuvant Potentiates Robust Immune Responses to Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 Immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT TM or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT TM induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralizing antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT TM can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

0	Trauma and orthopaedic team members' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: results of a UK survey. Aims: Healthcare systems have been rapidly restructured to meet COVID-19 demand. Clinicians are working to novel clinical guidelines, treating new patient cohorts and working in unfamiliar environments. Trauma and orthopaedics (T&O) has experienced cancellation of routine clinics and operating, with redistribution of the workload and human resources. To date, no studies have evaluated the mental health impact of these changes on the T&O workforce. We report the results of a novel survey on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of our orthopaedic workforce and the contributory factors., Methods: A 20-question survey-based cross-sectional study of orthopaedic team members was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to identify the impact of the pandemic on mental health in the form of major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD). The survey incorporated the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2), which is validated for screening of MDD, and the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-2), which is validated for screening of GAD., Results: There were 62 respondents (18 females and 44 males). As compared to the general population, we noted a greater estimated prevalence of GAD (17.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.0009297) and MDD (19.4% vs 3.3%, p = 0.0000007731). The prevalence of MDD symptoms was greatest among senior house officers (SHOs) (p = 0.02216). Female respondents scored higher for symptoms of MDD (p = 0.03583) and GAD (p = 0.0001086). Those identifying as 'Black, African, Caribbean or Black British' displayed a higher prevalence of GAD symptoms (p = 0.001575) and felt least supported at work (p = 0.001341)., Conclusion: Our study, in the first of its kind, shows a significant prevalence of GAD and MDD in the workforce. We found that SHOs, females and those of Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British origin were disproportionately affected. Action should be taken to help prevent adverse mental health outcomes for our colleagues during the pandemic.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:316-325.

0	40 days and 40 nights: Clinical characteristics of major trauma and orthopaedic injury comparing the incubation and lockdown phases of COVID-19 infection. Aims: The first death in the UK caused by COVID-19 occurred on 5 March 2020. We aim to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of major trauma and orthopaedic patients admitted in the early COVID-19 era., Methods: A prospective trauma registry was reviewed at a Level 1 Major Trauma Centre. We divided patients into Group A, 40 days prior to 5 March 2020, and into Group B, 40 days after., Results: A total of 657 consecutive trauma and orthopaedic patients were identified with a mean age of 55 years (8 to 98; standard deviation (SD) 22.52) and 393 (59.8%) were males. In all, 344 (approximately 50%) of admissions were major trauma. Group A had 421 patients, decreasing to 236 patients in Group B (36%). Mechanism of injury (MOI) was commonly a fall in 351 (52.4%) patients, but road traffic accidents (RTAs) increased from 56 (13.3%) in group A to 51 (21.6%) in group B (p = 0.030). ICU admissions decreased from 26 (6.2%) in group A to 5 (2.1%) in group B. Overall, 39 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with mean age of 73 years (28 to 98; SD 17.99) and 22 (56.4%) males. Common symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and pyrexia. Of these patients, 27 (69.2%) were nosocomial infections and two (5.1%) of these patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission with 8/39 mortality (20.5%). Of the patients who died, 50% were older and had underlying comorbidities (hypertension and cardiovascular disease, dementia, arthritis)., Conclusion: Trauma admissions decreased in the lockdown phase with an increased incidence of RTAs. Nosocomial infection was common in 27 (69.2%) of those with COVID-19. Symptoms and comorbidities were consistent with previous reports with noted inclusion of dementia and arthritis. The mortality rate of trauma and COVID-19 was 20.5%, mainly in octogenarians, and COVID-19 surgical mortality was 15.4%.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:330-338.

0	Early outcomes of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for trauma during COVID-19. Aims: This study aimed to identify patients receiving total hip arthroplasty (THA) for trauma during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and quantify the risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus, the proportion of patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), and rate of complications including mortality., Methods: All patients receiving a primary THA for trauma in four regional hospitals were identified for analysis during the period 1 March to 1 June 2020, which covered the current peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK., Results: Overall, one of 48 patients (2%) contracted COVID-19 during their admission. Although they required a protracted stay in hospital, they did not require ICU treatment. Two patients did require ICU support for medical problems but not relating to COVID-19. Complications were no greater than expected given the short follow-up. There were no mortalities., Conclusion: There is a paucity of evidence to guide restarting elective joint arthroplasties following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although THAs for trauma are by no means a perfect surrogate, the results of this study show a low incidence of contracting COVID-19 virus during admission and no significant sequalae during this period.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:438-442.

0	Lung ultrasound is a reliable diagnostic technique to predict abnormal CT chest scan and to detect oxygen requirements in COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID-19 pneumonia can be severe, with an unpredictable evolution and high mortality prevalence in older patients. The diagnosis is usually performed by RT-PCR or CT chest scan. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been proposed as an alternative method to monitor patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To assess the diagnostic performance of LUS, we performed LUS using a portable device and adapting a protocol already used in Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We used the score obtained with the index we created to assess for LUS diagnostic performance as compared to lung CT chest scan and to predict for oxygen requirements. Daily bedside LUS was easy to perform and microbiologically safe. LUS was 89% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting CT chest scan abnormalities, and 95% sensitive and 67% specific in detecting oxygen requirements. This is the first report on the diagnostic performance of LUS as compared to CT chest scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and assessments of oxygen requirements by LUS. LUS could help in the orientation of dyspneic patients to intensive care. It could also be proposed when there is limited access to CT scan in the context of a pandemic crisis, or to implement clinical lung examinations for outpatient follow-up.	false
0	Susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19 around the world. Misinformation about COVID-19 is a major threat to public health. Using five national samples from the UK (n = 1050 and n = 1150), Ireland (n = 700), the USA (n = 700), Spain (n = 700) and Mexico (n = 700), we examine predictors of belief in the most common statements about the virus that contain misinformation. We also investigate the prevalence of belief in COVID-19 misinformation across different countries and the role of belief in such misinformation in predicting relevant health behaviours. We find that while public belief in misinformation about COVID-19 is not particularly common, a substantial proportion views this type of misinformation as highly reliable in each country surveyed. In addition, a small group of participants find common factual information about the virus highly unreliable. We also find that increased susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people's self-reported compliance with public health guidance about COVID-19, as well as people's willingness to get vaccinated against the virus and to recommend the vaccine to vulnerable friends and family. Across all countries surveyed, we find that higher trust in scientists and having higher numeracy skills were associated with lower susceptibility to coronavirus-related misinformation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear link between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures, and suggest that interventions which aim to improve critical thinking and trust in science may be a promising avenue for future research.

0	Clinical course of COVID-19 infection in inflammatory rheumatological patients: a monocentric Belgian experience. Objective: Little is known about the incidence and consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. To improve our knowledge in this field, we collected data from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed COVID-19 infection., Methods: We performed a monocentric observational longitudinal study and collected data retrospectively from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection between 3 March and 10 June 2020., Results: A total of 23 patients developed COVID-19 infection. Seven patients needed hospitalization [female 57%, mean age 59 +/- 9 years], and 16 patients were followed as outpatients [female 80%, mean age 50 +/- 14 years]. All hospitalized patients had more than one co-morbidity. At the time of infection, all patients were on immunosuppressive therapy consisting of either conventional synthetic DMARDs and/or biotherapy, with or without CSs. A minority received Corticoids (CSs) only. The most common symptoms of COVID-19-infected patients were fever, dyspnoea, cough and fatigue. PCR and chest CT were performed in all hospitalized patients to confirm the diagnosis (100% positive PCR, 71% positive CT). All outclinic patients were diagnosed clinically (confirmed by PCR in only one). The mean length of hospital stay was 21 +/- 19 days.

0	Benefits and Risks of IgG Transplacental Transfer. Maternal passage of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is an important passive mechanism for protecting the infant while the neonatal immune system is still immature and ineffective. IgG is the only antibody class capable of crossing the histological layers of the placenta by attaching to the neonatal Fc receptor expressed at the level of syncytiotrophoblasts, and it offers protection against neonatal infectious pathogens. In pregnant women with autoimmune or alloimmune disorders, or in those requiring certain types of biological therapy, transplacental passage of abnormal antibodies may cause fetal or neonatal harm. In this review, we will discuss the physiological mechanisms and benefits of transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies as well as pathological maternal situations where this system is hijacked, potentially leading to adverse neonatal outcomes.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	COVID-19 and BCG vaccine: Is there a link?. The spread of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) makes the search for new approaches to prevent the infection of great importance. As one of the relevant approaches, the vaccination of risk groups with BCG vaccine has recently been suggested. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) is a live vaccine for tuberculosis, which is used in many countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and helps preventing childhood tuberculosis, primarily, military disease and tuberculosis meningitis. Whether BCG may be used to increase the protection against COVID-19 is currently a question of debates. The review considers scientific background underlying possible impact of BCG in increased protection against COVID-19. BCG is able of inducing the heterologous and trained immunity, and its capacity to stimulate antiviral immune response has been demonstrated in experimental animals and humans. Our comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in countries with different BCG vaccination policies has demonstrated a milder course of COVID-19 (i.e., a slower increase in disease cases and mortality) in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory for all children. However, an association between BCG vaccination and a milder COVID-19 course is not obligatory direct. Other factors that may affect the association, such as the level of virus testing, the rigidity and the speed of quarantine implementation and others are discussed. An important argument against a role of BCG in the protection against COVID-19 is that BCG is given in childhood and may hardly induce long-lasting immunity. Because mandatory BCG vaccination is implemented in countries with high TB burden and because in these countries latent tuberculosis infection is widely spread, we suggest a hypothesis that latent tuberculosis infection may contribute to the maintenance of heterologous/trained antiviral immunity in countries with mandatory BCG vaccination. Four countries have recently initiated clinical trials to investigate whether BCG vaccination can increase the level of protection against COVID-19 in risk groups. The results of these studies, as well as COVID-19 epidemiological modeling will help understanding the impact of BCG in the level of the protection against COVID-19. Performing analogous clinical trials in Russia seems appropriate and scientifically sound.Copyright © 2020 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute. All rights reserved.	false
0	A misleading cmv myocarditis during the covid-19 pandemic: Case report. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported as the possible cause of acute myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease mostly caused by viral infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) primary infection is often not suspected as a cause of myocarditis in immune-competent adults. We report the case of a 37-year-old male admitted with fever, cough and dyspnea. Chest CT showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. He was tested negative for COVID-19 but had biological markers that made us still suspect it. He had elevated troponin I level (up to 111.5 ng/mL) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). He was diagnosed with CMV myocarditis with cardiac insufficiency and totally recovered without antiviral therapy. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients may develop myocarditis, still every myocarditis is not a COVID infection. Myocarditis linked to CMV infection may be rare, but life-threatening.Copyright © Sara Oualim et al.	false
0	A one-year hospital-based prospective COVID-19 open-cohort in the Eastern Mediterranean region: The Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study. The COVID-19 is rapidly scattering worldwide, and the number of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is rising. Thus, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021. The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes. Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57+/-15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox Proportional-Hazards Model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation < 80% (HR = 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR = 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen saturation 80%-90% (HR = 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR = 1.6; [CI 95%: 1.1,2.5]). This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in the management of resources following this pandemic.	false

0	The Pursuit of COVID-19 Biomarkers: Putting the Spotlight on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Regulatory Sequences. Diverse populations worldwide are differentially affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While socioeconomic background has been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic variation underlying this phenomenon. This study is aimed at examining the genetic basis behind the great discrepancies among diverse ethnic groups in terms of COVID-19 susceptibility for viral infection, disease prognosis, and mortality. To this end, in silico analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory sequences of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-the virus's gateway to host cells-and their plausible implications on expression levels was conducted. We provide indication that the variation in the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulatory sequences is likely to be involved in and contribute to this phenomenon. SNPs that are abundant in the more susceptible populations introduce binding sites (BSs) for transcription factors or they may invalidate BSs for transcription repressor-both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues. SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels. This aspect, when added to the socioeconomic factors, can be a cause for the divergent prevalence of the disease and the different mortality rates within diverse populations. This demonstration may call for a shift in the paradigm of searching for COVID-19 biomarkers, such that SNPs within regulatory sequences should be of high importance.

0	Prevalence, Mechanisms, and Implications of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The infection started as an outbreak of pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan, China. Within a few weeks, it spread across the entire globe resulting in millions of cases and thousands of deaths. While respiratory symptoms and complications are well-defined and can be severe, non-respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have been added to the list of common COVID-19 symptoms. Their prevalence has been increasing, probably due to increased recognition and experience with the pandemic. Furthermore, diarrhea and stool testing may change prevalence and transmission rates due to suspicion for fecal-oral transmission of the COVID-19. Due to this risk, various countries have started testing wastewater and sewage systems to examine its role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among communities. In this review article, we describe the common gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, their prevalence based upon the current literature, and highlight the importance of early recognition and prompt attention. We also note the role of fecal-oral transmission. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these symptoms, the role of medications, and potential contributing factors are also elaborated.

0	Neonatal Infection Due to SARS-CoV-2: An Epidemiological Study in Spain. Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to increase worldwide. Although some data from pediatric series are available, more evidence is required, especially in neonates, a group with specific characteristics that deserve special attention. This study aimed to describe general and clinical characteristics, management, and treatment of postnatal-acquired (community and nosocomial/hospital-acquired) COVID-19 neonatal cases in Spain. Methods: This was a national prospective epidemiological study that included cases from a National Registry supported by the Spanish Society of Neonatology. Neonates with postnatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. General data and infection-related information (mode and source of transmission, age at diagnosis, clinical manifestations, need for hospitalization, admission unit, treatment administered, and complementary studies performed, hospital stay associated with the infection) were collected. Results: A total of 40 cases, 26 community-acquired and 14 nosocomial were registered. Ten were preterm newborns (2 community-acquired and 8 nosocomial COVID-19 cases). Mothers (in both groups) and healthcare workers (in nosocomial cases) were the main source of infection. Hospital admission was required in 22 community-acquired cases [18 admitted to the neonatal intermediate care unit (NIMCU) and 4 to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)]. Among nosocomial COVID-19 cases (n = 14), previously admitted for other reasons, 4 were admitted to the NIMCU and 10 to the NICU. Ten asymptomatic patients were registered (5 in each group). In the remaining cases, clinical manifestations were generally mild in both groups, including upper respiratory airways infection, febrile syndrome or acute gastroenteritis with good overall health. In both groups, most severe cases occurred in preterm neonates or neonates with concomitant pathologies. Most of the cases did not require respiratory support. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 4 patients in the community-acquired group and to 2 patients in the nosocomial group. Follow-up after hospital discharge was performed in most patients. Conclusions: This is the largest series of COVID-19 neonatal cases in Spain published to date. Although clinical manifestations were generally mild, prevention, treatment, and management in this group are essential.

0	Correlates of Mental Health Symptoms Among US Adults During COVID-19, March-April 2020. OBJECTIVES: An understanding of mental health symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is critical to ensure that health policies adequately address the mental health needs of people in the United States. The objective of this study was to examine mental health symptoms among US adults in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in late March 2020 with a national sample of 963 US adults using an online research platform. Participants self-reported state of residence, psychosocial characteristics, and levels of anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive function, and fatigue in the context of COVID-19 using validated patient-reported outcomes scales in the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System measures. We used analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression to evaluate correlates of mental health symptoms., RESULTS: Overall, participants reported high levels of anxiety (mean [SD], 57.2 [9.3]) and depression (mean [SD], 54.2 [9.5]). Levels of anger, anxiety, cognitive function, depression, and fatigue were significantly higher among the Millennial Generation and Generation X (vs Baby Boomers), those with not enough or enough (vs more than enough) financial resources, females vs males), those with self-reported disability (vs no self-reported disability), and those with inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy. In adjusted models, being in Generation X and the Millennial Generation (vs Baby Boomer), having not enough or enough vs more than enough) financial resources, and having inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy were most strongly correlated with worse mental health symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that mental health symptoms during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were prevalent nationally, regardless of state of residence and especially among young, psychosocially vulnerable groups.	false

0	Bone biology and COVID-19 infection: Is ACE2 a potential influence factor?. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a severe threat to global health management system since it has been detected in the human body. This pandemic was prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and rapidly developed into a public emergency with an alarming increase in cases and deaths. The increasing explorations to SARS-CoV-2 infection guide us to consider whether bone lesion is followed by this pathologic process. We especially focus on the underlying pathobiology that SARS-CoV-2 possibly mediated in bone remodeling and analyze the association of bone destruction with ACE2 in COVID-19 incidence, for preferable understanding the pathogenesis and providing necessary clinical management in orthopedics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	New insights on possible vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2019, a novel virus, namely COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, developed from Wuhan, (Hubei territory of China) used its viral spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the entrance into a host cell by binding with ACE-2 receptor and cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data revealed that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 affected more than 24,854,140 people with 838,924 deaths worldwide. Until now, no licensed immunization or drugs are present for the medication of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to investigate the latest developments and discuss the candidate antibodies in different vaccine categories to develop a reliable and efficient vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a short time duration. Besides, the review focus on the present challenges and future directions, structure, and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 for a better understanding. Based on data, we revealed that most of the vaccines are focus on targeting the spike protein (S) of COVID-19 to neutralized viral infection and develop long-lasting immunity. Up to phase-1 clinical trials, some vaccines showed the specific antigen-receptor T-cell response, elicit the humoral and immune response, displayed tight binding with human-leukocytes-antigen (HLA), and recognized specific antibodies to provoke long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	COVID-19 as an Immune Complex Hypersensitivity in Antigen Excess Conditions: Theoretical Pathogenetic Process and Suggestions for Potential Therapeutic Interventions. Because of particular properties of SARS-Cov-2, such as an high infection speed, its antigenic nature, evolutionarily unknown to the human immune system, and/or a viral interference on the immune response mechanisms, this virus would determine in the subjects a delayed anomalous (slow and/or low) immune response, ineffective and, finally, self-damaging. The hypothetical pathogenetic process for covid-19 could occur in three phases: a) Viral phase, asymptomatic or weakly symptomatic, with an a-specific innate immune response; b) Immunological phase, intermediately symptomatic, with an anomalous specific immune response (delayed, slow and/or low synthesis of IgM and IgG) in antigen excess conditions, immune complex formation and complement activation with tissue damages; c) Hemo-vascular phase, severely symptomatic, where complement-mediated tissue damages would induce vascular inflammation and systemic alteration of the coagulation homeostasis. This hypothesis is well supported by the immune-histochemical and microscopic demonstration in severe patient lungs of co-localized spike viral proteins, terminal components of the activated complement system (C5b-9 membrane attack complex) and microvascular deposits of small fibrin thrombi. This picture could be aggravated by the involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, releasing additional lytic and inflammatory factors. Thus, covid-19 would arise as a simple viral infection, develop as a diffuse immune complex hypersensitivity and explode as a systemic hemo-vascular pathology. If this hypothesized process would be real, suitable therapeutic interventions might be carried out, able to interfere with or block the critical factors in the various phases.

0	Antibody profiling and prevalence in US patients during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Antibody diagnostics play an important role in disease detection and can potentially aid in monitoring of the immune responses to see if an individual has developed immunity. Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2., METHODS: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw., RESULTS: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 99.67% and 99.77%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS (Dried Blood Spot) matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection., CONCLUSION: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.	false
0	Initial CT scanning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the Peruvian Central Air Force Hospital: A case series. We present nine cases of COVID-19 patients that developed pneumonia caused by SARSCov-2 who were seen in the Peruvian Central Air Force Hospital and showed different clinical features, risk factors, and outcomes. Findings of their thorax CT scans are described using a tomographic score that was applied on admission. Points assigned were based on the percentage of involvement on each pulmonary lobe and this allowed us to determine a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia according to its severity, even before having positive results in molecular and serological tests for some of these patients.Copyright © 2020 Colegio Medico del Peru.

0	Acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak among healthcare workers in China: a cross-sectional study. To study the acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak among healthcare workers (HCWs) in China, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs during the early period of COVID-19 outbreak. The acute psychological effects including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD was estimated at 15.0%, 27.1%, and 9.8%, respectively. Having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, receiving insufficient training for protection, and lacking confidence in protection measures were significantly associated with increased risk for depression and anxiety. Being a nurse, having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, and lacking confidence in protection measures were risk factors for PTSD. Meanwhile, not worrying about infection was a protective factor for developing depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Psychological interventions should be implemented among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce acute psychological effects and prevent long-term psychological comorbidities. Meanwhile, HCWs should be well trained and well protected before their frontline exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Assessing correlations between short-term exposure to atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 spread in all Italian territorial areas. The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the beta coronavirus responsible for the current pneumonia pandemic outbreak, has been speculated to be linked to short-term and long-term atmospheric pollutants exposure. The present work has been aimed at analyzing the atmospheric pollutants concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) and spatio-temporal distribution of cases and deaths (specifically incidence, mortality and lethality rates) across the whole Italian national territory, down to the level of each individual territorial area, with the goal of checking any potential short-term correlation between these two phenomena. The data analysis has been limited to the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the lockdown-dependent biased effects on the atmospheric pollutant levels as much as possible. The analysis looked at non-linear, monotonic correlations using the Spearman non-parametric correlation index. The statistical significance of the Spearman correlations has also been evaluated. The results of the statistical analysis suggest the hypothesis of a moderate-to-strong correlation between the number of days exceeding the annual regulatory limits of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 incidence, mortality and lethality rates for all the 107 territorial areas in Italy. A weak-to-moderate correlation seems to exist when considering the 36 territorial areas in four of the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 showed a higher non-linear correlation than NO2 with incidence, mortality and lethality rates. As to particulate matters, PM10 profile has been compared with the incidence rate variation that occurred in three of the most affected territorial areas in Northern Italy (i.e., Milan, Brescia, and Bergamo). All areas showed a similar PM10 time trend but a different incidence rate variation, that was less severe in Milan compared with Brescia and Bergamo.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Infection prevention precautions for routine anesthesia care during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Many health care systems around the world continue to struggle with large numbers of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, while others have diminishing numbers of cases following an initial surge. There will most likely be significant oscillations in numbers of cases for the foreseeable future, based on the regional epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Less affected hospitals and facilities will attempt to progressively resume elective procedures and surgery. Ramping up elective care in hospitals that deliberately curtailed elective care to focus on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients will present unique and serious challenges. Among the challenges will be protecting patients and providers from recurrent outbreaks of disease while increasing procedure throughput. Anesthesia providers will inevitably be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by patients who have not been diagnosed with infection. This is particularly concerning in consideration that aerosols produced during airway management may be infective. In this article, we recommend an approach to routine anesthesia care in the setting of persistent but variable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We make specific recommendations for personal protective equipment and for the conduct of anesthesia procedures and workflow based on evidence and expert opinion. We propose practical, relatively inexpensive precautions that can be applied to all patients undergoing anesthesia. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread primarily by respiratory droplets and aerosols, effective masking of anesthesia providers is of paramount importance. Hospitals should follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for universal masking of all providers and patients within their facilities. Anesthesia providers should perform anesthetic care in respirator masks (such as N-95 and FFP-2) whenever possible, even when the SARS-CoV-2 test status of patients is negative. Attempting to screen patients for infection with SARS-CoV-2, while valuable, is not a substitute for respiratory protection of providers, as false-negative tests are possible and infected persons can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Provision of adequate supplies of respirator masks and other respiratory protection equipment such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be a high priority for health care facilities and for government agencies. Eye protection is also necessary because of the possibility of infection from virus coming into contact with the conjunctiva. Because SARS-CoV-2 persists on surfaces and may cause infection by contact with fomites, hand hygiene and surface cleaning are also of paramount importance.Copyright © 2020 International Anesthesia Research Society	false
0	Carcinoembryonic Antigen: A Potential Biomarker to Evaluate the Severity and Prognosis of COVID-19. Background and Objectives: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious pandemic disease worldwide. Identification of biomarkers to predict severity and prognosis is urgently needed for early medical intervention due to high mortality of critical cases with COVID-19. This retrospective study aimed to indicate the values of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Method(s): We included 46 death cases from intensive care unit and 68 discharged cases from ordinary units with confirmed COVID-19 of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital from January 1 to March 22, 2020. Laboratory and radiologic data were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up until April 10, 2020. Result(s): COVID-19 patients in the death group had significantly higher CEA levels (ng/ml) than discharged group (14.80 +/- 14.20 vs. 3.80 +/- 2.43, P < 0.001). The risk of COVID-19 death increased 1.317 times for each additional 1 ng/ml CEA level (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.099-1.579). The standardized and weighted receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis adjusted to age, sex, and ferritin levels suggested that the area under the curve (AUC) of the serum CEA levels was 0.808 in discrimination between death cases and discharged cases with COVID-19 (P < 0.001). We found mortality of COVID-19 is associated with elevated CEA levels increased (HR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.005-1.042), as well as age (HR = 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016-1.086) and ferritin levels (HR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001-1.002) by survival analysis of Cox regression model. Among discharged patients, CEA levels were significant lower in moderate cases compared to the severe and critical cases (P = 0.005; OR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.294-0.808) from binary logistic regression analysis. The AUC of CEA levels was 0.79 in distinguishing moderate cases from discharged COVID-19 patients by standardized and weighted ROC analysis (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between CEA levels and CT scores existed in discharged patients (Correlation Coefficient: 0.687; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Elevated CEA levels increased the risk of death from COVID-19 and CEA levels were related to CT scores of the discharged patients positively.© Copyright © 2020 Chen, Kong, Qi, Ding, Ji, Wu, Huang, Wu, Huang, Xie, Liu and Tang.	false
0	Perspectives on the Early Quality of Evidence Guiding the Therapeutic Management of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Literature Review. Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a serious health concern. Repurposing of existing drugs indicated for other conditions seems to be the first choice for immediate therapeutic management. The quality of early evidence favoring the different treatment options needs to be apprised for informed decision-making. Method(s): In this systematic literature review, we apprised the quality of available evidence for different therapeutic options and also the basis for different treatment guidelines. To include all studies that are in different stages of publication, we also included studies from the preprint servers BioRxiv and MedRxiv and published studies from PubMed. Result(s): We retrieved 5621 articles and included 22 studies for the systematic review. Based on our study, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, convalescent sera, ritonavir/lopinavir, tocilizumab and arbidol were evaluated as therapeutic options. The data from different study designs reveal contradictory findings except for convalescent sera for which the evidence available is only from case series. Based on this early evidence, various national guidelines recommend remdesivir, convalescent sera, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine in different subsets of patients. Conclusion(s): Establishing consensus with respect to the end points to be assessed for respiratory viruses may enhance the quality of evidence in case of future pandemics. The systematic review highlighted the lacuna and methodologic deficiency in early clinical evidence and included an update on different therapeutic management guidelines. Further clinical evidence from the ongoing trials may lead to evolution of treatment guidelines with the addition of more therapeutic options.Copyright © 2020, Springer Healthcare Ltd., part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Giant Gastric Ulcers: An Unusual Culprit. Abstract: Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is routinely used immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation is commonly associated with several gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Here we present a case of giant gastric ulcer of 5 cm from MMF use post cardiac transplant. Case Description: A 56-year-old male with history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy post heart transplant was on immunosuppression with MMF, tacrolimus and prednisone for 5 months. He presented with severe epigastric pain and intermittent episodes of melena for 1 month. His pain radiated to back that is worsened with eating. Associated with loss of appetite, vomiting and 16-pound weight loss in 3 months. He never smoked, drank alcohol or used over the counter pain medications. He was profoundly anemic requiring blood transfusions. EGD performed demonstrated very large clean-based ulcer of 5 cm diameter in the body, smaller ulcer of 8 mm diameter in pre-pyloric region and 5-10 small aphthous ulcers in the gastric body and fundus. Gastric biopsies taken from the ulcer were negative for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus and malignancy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed non-bleeding inflamed internal hemorrhoids. Consequently, MMF was discontinued and switched to azathioprine. He was treated with twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy with resolution of abdominal pain, improved appetite and weight gain. Discussion(s): MMF is well known for common GI side-effects such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, ulcers, abdominal pain and rarely gastrointestinal bleeding. Few studies reported 3 to 8% incidence of ulcer perforation and GI bleeding within 6 months. Risk of gastroduodenal erosions is nearly 1.83 times for MMF, with the highest lesions associated with MMF-tacrolimus-corticosteroid combination treatment as seen in our patient. Hypothesis is that GI tract is vulnerable because of dependence of enterocytes on de novo synthesis of purines, which is disrupted by MMF. Typically, upper GI mucosal injuries of mucosal irritation leading to esophagitis, gastritis and/or ulcers are seen. Endoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic if bleeding gastric ulcers are noted. Minor complications improve with reduction of drug dose or use of enteric coated preparation if feasible. Discontinuation of the drug is main stay in the management of MMF related ulcer disease. Simple medical treatment with either H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, coating agents, prostaglandins or combination has proven effective in most cases. Considering excellent results with medical management of ulcer, role of surgery is limited.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false

Materials and Methods In this retrospective data collection study, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) coordinated a survey between May and July 2020 regarding CT utilization, protocols, and radiation doses from 62 healthcare sites in 34 countries across five continents for CT exams performed in COVID-19 pneumonia. The questionnaire obtained information on local prevalence, method of diagnosis, most frequent imaging, indications for CT, and specific policies on use of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Collected data included general information (patient age, weight, clinical indication), CT equipment (CT make and model, year of installation, number of detector rows), scan protocols (body region, scan phases, tube current and potential), and radiation dose descriptors (CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP)). Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations were performed. Results Data from 782 patients (median age (interquartile range) of 59(15) years) from 54 healthcare sites in 28 countries were evaluated. Less than one-half of the healthcare sites used CT for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and three-fourth used CT for assessing disease severity. CTDIvol varied based on CT vendors (7-11mGy, p<0.001), number of detector-rows (8-9mGy, p<0.001), year of CT installation (7-10mGy, p=0.006), and reconstruction techniques (7-10mGy, p=0.03). Multiphase chest CT exams performed in 20% of sites (11 of 54) were associated with higher DLP compared with single-phase chest CT exams performed in 80% (43 of 54 sites) (p=0.008). Conclusion CT use, scan protocols, and radiation doses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed wide variation across healthcare sites within the same and different countries. Many patients were scanned multiple times and/or with multiphase CT scan protocols. See also the editorial by Lee.	false

While COVID-19, the disease driven by SARS-CoV-2 has ignited interest in the host immune response to this infection, it has also highlighted the lack of treatment options for the damaging inflammatory responses driven by pathogens that precipitate the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). With the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of a second winter spike alongside seasonal flu, the need for effective and targeted anti-inflammatory agents is even more pressing. Here we discuss the aetiology of COVID-19 and the common signalling pathways driven by SARS-CoV-2, namely p38 MAP kinase. We highlight that p38 MAP kinase becomes elevated with increasing age, thereby driving many of the inflammatory pathways that precipitate death in old people with the added drawback of impairing vaccine efficacy in this susceptible age group. Finally, we review drugs available to inhibit p38 MAP kinase, their risks-versus-benefits as well as suggested dosing regimen to combat over-exuberant innate immune responses and potentially reverse vaccine inefficacy in older patients.

0	Role of inositol to improve surfactant functions and reduce IL-6 levels: A potential adjuvant strategy for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia?. To date, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing worldwide and represents a primary healthcare emergency. Although the infection can be asymptomatic, several cases develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily interleukin (IL)-6. Based on available data, the severity of ARDS and serum levels of IL-6 are key determinants for the prognosis. In this scenario, available in vitro and in vivo data suggested that myo-inositol is able to increase the synthesis and function of the surfactant phosphatidylinositol, acting on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-regulated signaling, with amelioration of both immune system and oxygenation at the bronchoalveolar level. In addition, myo-inositol has been found able to decrease the levels of IL-6 in several experimental settings, due to an effect on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and on the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. In this scenario, treatment with myo-inositol may be able to reduce IL-6 dependent inflammatory response and improve oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the action of myo-inositol on IRE1 endonuclease activity may also inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, as was reported for the respiratory syncytial virus. Since the available data are extremely limited, if this potential therapeutic approach will be considered valid in the clinical practice, the necessary future investigations should aim to identify the best dose, administration route (oral, intravenous and/or aerosol nebulization), and cluster(s) of patients which may get beneficial effects from this treatment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Significantly decreased mortality in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients transfused early with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We here present results from 60-day follow up of our cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.

0	Differential diagnosis and prospective grading of COVID-19 at the early stage with simple hematological and biochemical variables. We evaluated simple laboratory variables to discriminate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia or influenza and for the prospective grading of COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to estimate the diagnostic performance of the significant discriminating variables. A comparative analysis was performed with different severity. The leukocytosis (P=0.017) and eosinopenia (P=0.001) were discriminating variables between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 and 0.825. Monocytosis (P=0.003), the decreased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (P<0.001), and the increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P=0.028) were predictive of influenza with AUC of 0.723, 0.895, and 0.783, respectively. Serum amyloid protein, lactate dehydrogenase, CD3+ cells, and the fibrinogen degradation products had a good correlation with the severity of COVID-19 graded by age (>=50) and NLR (>=3.13). Simple laboratory variables are helpful for rapid diagnosis on admission and hierarchical management of COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	The incidence, risk factors and prognosis of acute kidney injury in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19 in mainland China: a retrospective study. BACKGROUND: The clinical correlates, prognosis and determinants of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remain largely unclear., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 23rd 2020 and April 6th 2020 at Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University., RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 131 were males (62.4%). The median Age was 64 years (IQR: 56-71). Of 92 (43.8%) patients who developed AKI during hospitalization, 13 (14.1%), 15 (16.3%) and 64 (69.6%) were classified as being at stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 54 patients (58.7%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. Age, sepsis, nephrotoxic drug, invasive mechanical ventilation and elevated baseline serum creatinine levels were associated with the occurrence of AKI. Renal recovery during hospitalization was identified among 16 patients with AKI (17.4%), who had a significantly shorter time from admission to AKI diagnosis, lower incidence of right heart failure and higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen. Of 210 patients, 93 deceased within 28 days of ICU admission. AKI stage 3, critical disease, greater Age and the lowest ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen being < 150 mmHg were independently associated with death., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Covid-19, the incidence of AKI was high. Our findings of the risk factors of the development of AKI and factors associated with renal function recovery may inform clinical management of patients with critical illness of Covid-19.	false

0	The Strategic National Stockpile: Identification, Support, and Acquisition of Medical Countermeasures for CBRN Incidents. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) serves as a repository of materiel, including medical countermeasures (MCMs), that would be used to support the national health security response to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) incident, either natural or terrorism-related. To support and advance the SNS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) manages targeted investigatory research portfolios, such as Countermeasures Against Chemical Terrorism (CounterACT) for chemical agents, that coordinate projects covering basic research, drug discovery, and preclinical studies. Project BioShield, managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA), guides and supports academia and industry with potential MCMs through the Food & Drug Administration's approval process and ultimately supports the acquisition of successful products into the SNS. Public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ever-increasing number of MCMs in the SNS present logistical and financial challenges to its maintenance. While MCMs for biological agents have been readily adopted, those for chemical agents have required sustained investments. This paper reviews the methods by which MCMs are identified and supported for inclusion in the SNS, the current status of MCMs for CBRN threats, and challenges with SNS maintenance as well as identifies persistent obstacles for MCM development and acquisition, particularly for ones focused on chemical weapons.	false
0	COVID-19 mortality risk for older men and women. BACKGROUND: Case-fatality from COVID-19 has been reported to be relatively high in patients age 65 years or older. We sought to determine the age-specific rates of COVID-19 mortality at the population level., METHODS: We obtained information regarding the total number of COVID-19 reported deaths for six consecutive weeks beginning at the 50th recorded death, among 16 countries that reported a relatively high number of COVID-19 cases as of April 12, 2020. We performed an ecological study to model COVID-19 mortality rates per week by age group (54 years or younger, 55-64 years, and 65 years or older) and sex using a Poisson mixed effects regression model., RESULTS: Over the six-week period of data, there were 178,568 COVID-19 deaths from a total population of approximately 2.4 billion people. Age and sex were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Compared with individuals ages 54 years or younger, the incident rate ratio (IRR) was 8.1, indicating that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 8.1 times higher (95%CI = 7.7, 8.5) among those 55 to 64 years, and more than 62 times higher (IRR = 62.1; 95%CI = 59.7, 64.7) among those ages 65 or older. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were 77% higher in men than in women (IRR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.74, 1.79)., CONCLUSIONS: In the 16 countries examined, persons age 65 years or older had strikingly higher COVID-19 mortality rates compared to younger individuals, and men had a higher risk of COVID-19 death than women.	false

It is unknown whether there is direct muscle invasion and how often the critically ill have muscle sequelae. Regarding autoimmune myopathies, a retrospective study of statin-induced necrotizing myopathy is covered. A relatively large proportion of patients had normal strength at presentation. Examples of dermatomyositis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are provided including one with cytokine storm. A report of juvenile dermatomyositis with severe abdominal complications is noteworthy. Two articles address unusual associations with inclusion body myositis, namely, spinocerebellar ataxias and granuloma myositis. In the category of muscular dystrophies, a relatively large single center study of the outcome of scapulothoracic arthrodesis for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is discussed and a article on anoctaminopathies with pauci- or asymptomatic hyperCKemia.	false
0	Evaluation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) in covid-19: A systematic review on all types of studies for epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of SARS-CoV for cell entry. We aimed to check the association between ACE2 and COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in a systematic review. Two databases (PubMed/Medline and Scopus) and bioRxiv were checked for retrieving all types of studies in relation to ACE2 and COVID-19 until March 18, 2020. Forty-one studies were entered to the systematic review. These studies included nineteen original, eight reviews, four letters to the editor, three research papers, one correspondence, one commentary, one mini review, two reports, one opinion, and one perspective. In summary, the results showed that the ACE2 receptor for COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV. However, its expression was different in various populations as well as in the two genders. ACE2 may be used as a therapeutic target. Patients who take ACE inhibitors may have benefit in severe disease outcomes. Finally, pangolins and snakes and turtles may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting disease to humans.Copyright © 2020 Houshang Nemati, Mazaher Ramezani, Farid Najafi, Babak Sayad, Mehri Nazeri, Masoud Sadeghi.	false
0	[Survey data as a way to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19. A pilot study in the city of Madrid.]. OBJECTIVE: This research (EP-Covid19-Madrid) was inspired on the lack in the middle of March 2020 of data on COVID-19 produced from representative samples. Its goal was to evaluate the potential of interviewing such type of samples in order to assess the incidence and prevalence of epidemics as COVID-19., METHODS: The sample was of 211 households in the city of Madrid, with one informant for all household members (571). Households were selected through random generation of phone numbers, informants through sex and age quotes. A questionnaire was applied on April/3/20, with a list of symptoms and basic socio-demographic questions for the informant and a general question on COVID-19 for co-residents. Data was analyzed through cross-tabulations and logistic regression., RESULTS: Prevalence for individuals. On April/3/20, 10,9% of people 18 years and older living in Madrid reported symptoms compatible with COVID19 (SCC19). Occurrence of SCC19 was similar for both sexes, being respectively above and below the mean for the 40-49 (18,9%) and for the >69 (4%) age groups, showing no relation with household size, but being associated with economic activity (19% among working population) and, even more strongly, with the fact of living with symptomatic co-residents (52%). As for households, there was one member with SCC19 in 17% of households. In 8% of the households two or more members presented SSC19, in fact representing 42,9% of the people in these multiply affected households., CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of SSC19 was much higher than officially reported for COVID-19, although surprisingly low for people of >65. This prevalence associates with work and intra-home transmission. The inter and intra-home prevalence rates (17% and 42,9% respectively) might be useful to assess the proportion of asymptomatic carriers. These results would benefit from confirmation in larger surveys, preferably also including COVID-19 serological testing.	false
0	Estimating effective reproduction number using generation time versus serial interval, with application to covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. BACKGROUND: The effective reproduction number R e (t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. R e (t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution: the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating R e (t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution: the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in covid-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts., METHODS: We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of R e (t) for covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution., RESULTS: We estimated the generation time of covid-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of R e (t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of R e (t) due to larger variance., IMPLICATIONS: Approximation of the generation time distribution of covid-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating R e (t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.

The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays an important role in bacterial and viral infections. Here, we report that either pharmacological inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase with amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or maprotiline or genetic downregulation of the enzyme prevents infection of cultured cells or freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles (pp-VSV) presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase and triggers a release of ceramide on the cell surface. Neutralization or consumption of surface ceramide reduces infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers with a low dose of amitriptyline prevents infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, a safe drug used clinically for almost 60 years, or other antidepressants that functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Coronavirus disease 2019, which emerged in Wuhan in China in early December 2019, gradually spread across the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March, 12 2020. The disease shows a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic course to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Although data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in HIV-infected cases are still limited, it is thought that the presence of comorbidities is important for mortality and morbidity in infected cases. In this report, it was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient diagnosed with HIV for six years with negative HIV-1 viral load and a CD4 lymphocyte count of 240 cells/mm3Copyright © 2020 Bilimsel Tip Yayinevi.

0	COVID-19 in cystic fibrosis patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, the European cystic fibrosis society (ECFS) has decided to launch a special ECFS-COVID-19 program to collect information on the of COVID-19 characteristics in the patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The results of the program should help timely and efficiently provide the patients with CF with the necessary care. Initially, it was assumed that COVID-19 would be severe in CF patients. The aim. To assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Russian Federation (RF). Methods. 6 cases (4 children and 2 adults) of COVID-19 in Russian CF patients were analyzed. Results. There are 405,843 infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Russia, the incidence of coronavirus infection in Russia was 1.4 cases per 1 thousand people. According to the Ministry of Health of the RF, as of December 2019, there were 3,931 patients with CF (2,823 children and 1,108 adults). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1.5 per 1000 patients with CF (1.4: 1,000 for children and 1.8: 1,000 for adults). The incidence was not higher than in the General population. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed in 4 boys and 2 women, 3 of the patients were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 - with Achromobacter spp. Mild disease was seen in 5 patients including all the children. Pneumonia was registered in 3 patients. One child with COVID-19 had abdominal syndrome. 2 patients - 1 adult and 1 child - needed in-patient care. Additional antibiotics were given to 4 patients, 2 of them received i/v antibiotics. One adult patient was on the lung transplantation waiting list. This woman had long-term oxygen therapy and BiPAP noninvasive respiratory support before the infection with SARS-CoV-2, FEV1 was 24 %pred. Conclusion. Despite the fact that patients with CF are at risk of severe COVID-19, to date, in the described cases, COVID-19 infection has not led to a significant deterioration of the symptoms of CF. Not a single fatal outcome in Russian patients with CF has been recorded.Copyright © 2020 Medical Education. All rights reserved.	false
0	"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): Value of IL-6 inhibitors. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drawn attention to new clinical and fundamental issues in the immunopathology of human diseases. Since in COVID-19 it is the ''hyperimmune'' response, called cytokine storm syndrome, which forms the basis of the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19, special attention is drawn to the possibility of ""repurposing"" (drug repurposing) of some widely used for treatment immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMIRDs) anti-inflammatory drugs, including glucocorticoids (GC), disease-modified anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents and ''targeted'' DMARDs. In the spectrum of cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm syndrome in IMIRDs and COVID-19, great importance is attached to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin IL-6. The development and introduction into clinical practice of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit the activity of IL-6 are among the major advances in the treatment of IMIRDs, and in recent years, critical conditions within the framework of the cytokine storm syndrome, including in COVID-19. The review discusses the materials of numerous studies devoted to the problems of the efficacy and safety of mAbs to the IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab) and other mAbs that inhibit the activity of this cytokine in COVID-19. Despite the effectiveness of inhibiting IL-6 in patients with severe COVID-19, many theoretical and clinical problems of immunopathology and pharmacotherapy of this disease require further study.Copyright © 2020 Medical Education.

0	A new ERAP2/ISO3 isoform expression is triggered by different microbial stimuli in human cells. Could it play a role in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection?. Following influenza infection, rs2248374-G ERAP2 expressing cells may transcribe an alternative spliced isoform: ERAP2/Iso3. This variant, unlike ERAP2-wt, is unable to trim peptides to be loaded on MHC class I molecules, but it can still dimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt, thus contributing to profiling an alternative cellular immune-peptidome. In order to verify if the expression of ERAP2/Iso3 may be induced by other pathogens, PBMCs and MDMs isolated from 20 healthy subjects were stimulated with flu, LPS, CMV, HIV-AT-2, SARS-CoV-2 antigens to analyze its mRNA and protein expression. In parallel, Calu3 cell lines and PBMCs were in vitro infected with growing doses of SARS-CoV-2 (0.5, 5, 1000 MOI) and HIV-1BAL (0.1, 1, and 10 ng p24 HIV-1Bal /1 x 106 PBMCs) viruses, respectively. Results showed that: (1) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression can be prompted by many pathogens and it is coupled with the modulation of several determinants (cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes, activation/inhibition markers, antigen-presentation elements) orchestrating the anti-microbial immune response (Quantigene); (2) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA is translated into a protein (western blot); (3) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 concentration. Considering the key role played by ERAPs in antigen processing and presentation, it is conceivable that these enzymes may be potential targets and modulators of the pathogenicity of infectious diseases and further analyses are needed to define the role played by the different isoforms.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Malaysia experience in tackling Covid19: A narrative review. Covid-19 remains a worldwide pandemic. This is obviously due to new cases increasing and made worse by co-existing medical problems including death. The main issues in the management are movement control order and screening of the disease at an early stage in order to prevent transmission, complications and treat them early. The incidence of Covid-19 in Malaysia is on a relentless march superseding any previous projections made by WHO. From December 2009 till March 2020 the rate of infection in the number of patients with Covid-19 has stayed high. Every effort should be made to slow and flatten this transmission and what better way than to focus on Malaysians' health. In the meantime society and the country as a whole has to bear the immense health and economic burden of the disease. The aim of the review was to describe the acceptance on Covid-19 in Malaysia. An extensive literature review of acceptance, knowledge, attitude, practice and decision making was performed to highlight the issues related with Covid-19. It is hoped that with the evidence, can facilitate us for better understanding.Copyright © 2020 Lahore Medical And Dental College. All rights reserved.	false
0	Evaluation of the relationship of serum vitamin d levels in covid-19 patients with clinical course and prognosis. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, infected more than six million people in a short time. In COVID-19, the relationship of many laboratory parameters to morbidity and mortality has been defined. In our study, we aimed to determine the relationship of serum vitamin D level to clinical course and prognosis. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 108 patients; 88 patients who stayed in Ataturk University and Erzurum City Hospital between March 24, 2020 and May 15, 2020, who were identified as COVID-19 by real-time PCR method from the nasopharyngeal swab and 20 asymptomatic voluntary medical personnel who tested negative for real-time PCR after routine check-up in our hospital. Result(s): In statistical analysis conducted between healthy control group and vitamin D levels of patients admitted due to COVID-19, it was observed that patients infected with COVID-19 had a lower level (p= 0.004). In 20 patients developing MAS, a lower level of vitamin D was observed (p= 0.004) compared to 68 patients who did not develop. In the comparison of vitamin D levels of the patients (n= 8) who developed exitus in their follow up due to COVID-19, it was observed that vitamin D levels were statisti-cally significantly lower compared to the living (p= 0.009). Conclusion(s): Due to COVID-19, pandemic, long-running quarantines caused insufficient use of sunlight and worsening of vitamin D deficiency. We wanted to draw attention again with our study to vitamin D which can be responsible for the heavy clinical course of COVID-19 and whose replacement is easy to apply.Copyright © 2020 by Tuberculosis and Thorax.	false

0	Count regression models for COVID-19. At the end of 2019, the current novel coronavirus emerged as a severe acute respiratory disease that has now become a worldwide pandemic. Future generations will look back on this difficult period and see how our society as a whole united and rose to this challenge. Many reports have suggested that this new virus is becoming comparable to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. We provide a statistical study on the modelling and analysis of the daily incidence of COVID-19 in eighteen countries around the world. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to fit count regression models to the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in various countries and make short term predictions of these numbers. The results suggest that the biggest advantage of these methods is that they are simplistic and straightforward allowing us to obtain preliminary results and an overall picture of the trends in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world. The best fitting count regression model for modelling the number of new daily COVID-19 cases of all countries analysed was shown to be a negative binomial distribution with log link function. Whilst the results cannot solely be used to determine and influence policy decisions, they provide an alternative to more specialised epidemiological models and can help to support or contradict results obtained from other analysis.

0	Recovery from COVID-19 in a B-cell-depleted multiple sclerosis patient. Approximately 200,000 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients worldwide receive B-cell-depleting immunotherapy with rituximab (anti-CD20), which eliminates the ability to generate an antibody response to new infections. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies might help viral clearance, these patients could be at risk of severe complications if infected. Here, we report on an MS patient who had received rituximab for ~3 years. The patient was examined 5 days before the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and was admitted to the hospital 2 days after. She recovered 14 days after symptom onset despite having a 0% B lymphocyte count and not developing SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.	false
0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of advance care planning services within the veterans administration system in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the outpatient advance care planning (ACP) services provided by veterans hospitals in Taiwan., METHODS: This study adopted a retrospective data analysis. We investigated ACP services provided by 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan from 2019 to June 2020. We also conducted a statistical analysis on the ACP services provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital., RESULTS: From 2019 to June 2020, 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan provided ACP services to 2,493 individuals. The outpatient ACP services declined significantly after January 2020, decreasing from a national average of 206.2 +/- 29.2 declarants per month to 106.2 +/- 30.8 declarants per month in the 6 months immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (p < 0.001). From the official implementation of the ACP in January 2019 to the end of June 2020, a total of 1,126 declarants accepted ACP services at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. When the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent, the declarants who received ACP services were younger (i.e., 60.1 +/- 15.2 vs. 65.5 +/- 16.3 years; p <0.001). After the variables had been adjusted, the changes in the characteristics of the declarants receiving ACP services when the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent were as follows: a significant increase in the percentage of hospital staff receiving ACP services (OR: 5.460, 95% CI: 2.378-12.536); An increase in the percentage of declarants who paid for the ACP services received at their own expense (OR: 3.417, 95% CI: 1.591-7.339); and an increase in the percentage of declarants who received the consultations with 3 or more people (OR: 2.017, 95% CI: 1.278-3.182)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 severely changed outpatient ACP services provided by hospitals. The results obtained by this study offer valuable insight regarding the provision of outpatient ACP services.	false

The COVID-19 pandemic and its global response have resulted in unprecedented and rapid changes to most people's day-to-day lives. To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing (""social distancing""), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 3,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a ""nature-based solution"" for improved public health.

0	Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in the COVID-19 era: An expected new entity. OBJECTIVES: Information on the recently COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) entity is scarce. We describe eight CAPA patients, compare them to colonised ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and review the published literature from Western countries., METHODS: Prospective study (March to May, 2020) that included all COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital. Modified AspICU and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria were used., RESULTS: CAPA was diagnosed in eight patients (3.3% of 239 ICU patients). Mostly affected non-immunocompromised patients (75%) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving corticosteroids. Diagnosis was established after a median of 15 days under mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in two patients with positive Aspergillus fumigatus cultures and galactomannan (GM) index. Serum GM was positive in 4/8 (50%). Thoracic CT-scan findings fulfilled EORTC/MSG criteria in one case. Isavuconazole was used in 4/8 cases. CAPA-related mortality was 100% (8/8). Compared with colonised patients, CAPA subjects were administered tocilizumab more often (100% vs. 40%, p=0.04), underwent longer courses of antibacterial therapy (13 vs. 5 days, p=0.008), and had a higher all-cause mortality (100% vs. 40%, p=0.04). We reviewed 96 similar cases from recent publications: 59 probable CAPA (also putative according modified AspICU), 56 putative cases and 13 colonisations according AspICU algorithm; according EORTC/MSG six proven and two probable. Overall, mortality in the reviewed series was 56.3%., CONCLUSIONS: CAPA must be considered a serious and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with severe COVID-19 receiving immunosuppressive treatment.

0	Estimation of differential occupational risk of COVID-19 by comparing risk factors with case data by occupational group. BACKGROUND: The disease burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not uniform across occupations. Although healthcare workers are well-known to be at increased risk, data for other occupations are lacking. In lieu of this, models have been used to forecast occupational risk using various predictors, but no model heretofore has used data from actual case numbers. This study assesses the differential risk of COVID-19 by occupation using predictors from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and correlating them with case counts published by the Washington State Department of Health to identify workers in individual occupations at highest risk of COVID-19 infection., METHODS: The O*NET database was screened for potential predictors of differential COVID-19 risk by occupation. Case counts delineated by occupational group were obtained from public sources. Prevalence by occupation was estimated and correlated with O*NET data to build a regression model to predict individual occupations at greatest risk., RESULTS: Two variables correlate with case prevalence: disease exposure (r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002), and predict 47.5% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003) on multiple linear regression analysis. The highest risk occupations are in healthcare, particularly dental, but many nonhealthcare occupations are also vulnerable., CONCLUSIONS: Models can be used to identify workers vulnerable to COVID-19, but predictions are tempered by methodological limitations. Comprehensive data across many states must be collected to adequately guide implementation of occupation-specific interventions in the battle against COVID-19.

0	Demographic & clinical profile of patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital in north India. Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a major public health emergency affecting the healthcare services all over the world. It is essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in different parts of our country. This study highlights clinical experience in managing patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care centre in northern India., Methods: Clinical characteristics and outcomes of consecutive adults patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh, India, from April 1 to May 25, 2020 were studied. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were managed according to the institute's consensus protocol and in accordance with Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines., Results: During the study period, 114 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted. The history of contact with COVID-19-affected individuals was available in 75 (65.8%) patients. The median age of the patients was 33.5 yr (13-79 yr), and there were 66 (58%) males. Of the total enrolled patients, 48 (42%) were symptomatic. The common presenting complaints were fever (37, 77%), cough (26, 54%) and shortness of breath (10, 20.8%). Nineteen (17%) patients had hypoxia (SpO2<94%) at presentation and 36 (31%) had tachypnoea (RR >24). Thirty four (29.8%) patients had an accompanying comorbid illness. Age more than 60 yr and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was needed in 18 patients (52%), with three (2.6%) patients requiring assisted ventilation. Mortality of 2.6 per cent (3 patients) was observed., Interpretation & conclusions: Majority of the patients with COVID-19 infection presenting to our hospital were young and asymptomatic. Fever was noted only in three-fourth of the patients and respiratory symptoms in half of them. Patients with comorbidities were more vulnerable to complications. Triaged classification of patients and protocol-based treatment resulted in good outcomes and low case fatality.	false
0	IMPACT OF FULL DOSE ANTICOAGULATION IN HOSPITALIZED PREDOMINANTLY BLACK PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: A RETROSPECTIVE SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE. SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) infection can be associated with coagulopathy and a high incidence of thromboembolic events. Our study investigated the impact of full dose anticoagulation versus standard prophylaxis anticoagulation in hospitalized, predominantly Black patients with COVID-19 infection METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study based on chart review of patients admitted to the University Hospital of Brooklyn in New York City from March 23rd, 2020 through April 23rd, 2020. Inclusion criteria included age >= 18 years, confirmed COVID-19 infection, and available baseline D-dimer level. Patients were studied under two groups: full dose anticoagulant (AC) versus prophylactic dose (non-AC). The variables collected included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, type of anticoagulation, major bleeds, and Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score. Follow-up clinic and telehealth visit notes were utilized to establish survival at 28 days RESULTS: A total of 138 hospitalized patients met the inclusion criteria. 119 (86.2%) were Black, 77 (56%) were males, 60 (44%) were females, and the average age of all was 66.6 years. 120 (85.5%) received full dose AC. Median hospital course for all patients was 12 days [IQR 7.00 to 24.25]. Kaplan Meier median survival was 25 days for AC group [95% CI 21.9-28.1] and 9 days [95% CI 6.4-11.6] for non-AC. Unadjusted proportional hazard ratio (HR) showed that full dose AC resulted in decreased mortality with a HR of 0.387 [95% CI 0.204 - 0.734; p=0.004], with multivariate proportional hazard adjusted for D-dimer, SIC score and CRP level of 0.159 [HR=0.159, 95% CI 0.070 - 0.361; p<0.001]. Patients who received full dose AC had higher D-dimer, CRP and SIC scores at baseline. Survival based on agent used showed no difference between direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Kaplan Meier median survival for DOAC was 20 days (95% CI 11.1-28.9) versus LMWH median survival of 25 days (95% CI 17.7-32.3). AC was stopped in a total of 11 patients (9 for major bleeds, 2 for down trending hemoglobin); with a Pearson's chi-square=4.716 (p=0.09) which is statistically insignificant. CONCLUSION(S): In hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, administration of full dose anticoagulation showed a 28-day survival benefit in a predominantly Black population, especially those with a higher D-dimer, CRP, and SIC score at baseline. Further investigation with a randomized control trial of full dose anticoagulation in COVID -19 infection is warranted CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Empiric full dose anticoagulation has a role to play in the clinical management of high-risk hospitalized patients with COVID -19 infection while awaiting definitive therapies.

0	COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis: Diagnostic difficulties or incorrect methods?. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lung disease with wide distribution worldwide. With the appearance of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), difficulties arise when evaluating, diagnosing, and treating patients with other conditions, including CF. We present the case of a patient with CF who had a definite serological diagnosis, a CT scan suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19, and a negative molecular test (RT-PCR), with rapid resolution of symptoms and early discharge. CF/SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity needs to be adequately studied and assessed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Associations between COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief with COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors: cross-sectional online study. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified by the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association of receiving misinformation with sociodemographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief, and psychological distress, as well as the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018., Background: Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern. Objective(s): We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and beliefs, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors., Conclusions: COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of misinformation to undermine global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter the proliferation of misinformation., Results: Overall, 67.78% (n=711) of respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (aOR 1.79, 1.27-2.51). Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (aOR 1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (aOR 1.47, 1.09-2.00), and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (aOR 1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (aOR 7.33, 5.17-10.38). Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (high: aOR 0.62, 0.45-0.84) and fewer preventive behaviors (>=7 behaviors: aOR 0.54, 0.39-0.74).Copyright ©Jung Jae Lee, Kyung-Ah Kang, Man Ping Wang, Sheng Zhi Zhao, Janet Yuen Ha Wong, Siobhan O'Connor, Sook Ching Yang, Sunhwa Shin.	false
0	Immunotherapeutics for Covid-19 and post vaccination surveillance. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic and named as novel coronavirus disease (nCOVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is different from other known viruses due to multiple mutations on the sites of nonstructural proteins (NSP) 2 and 3, and the varying nature of virulence between different persons. Immunotherapies such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies have a protective effect on the patients bringing them to the front of the line of potential treatments. The present review intends to cover the development of 20 different vaccine candidates categorized under live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Formulation of these vaccine candidates by various companies in collaboration with global organizations and their status of clinical trials were addressed. On the other hand, various approaches for post-vaccination surveillance using nucleic acid and protein biomarkers imbued on suitable platforms were also highlighted to sum up the immune therapeutics for Covid-19.

0	Implementation and Evaluation of a Text Message-Based Addiction Counseling Program (Text4Hope-Addiction Support): Protocol for a Questionnaire Study. BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing counseling to people with drug or alcohol addiction while maintaining physical distance has been challenging. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (as used in the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program) as a convenient, evidence-based, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention with high user satisfaction proven in prior research., OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) to reduce drug or alcohol cravings as well as anxiety and depression, typically associated with alcohol and substance use disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope-Addiction Support intervention in mitigating cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms., METHODS: Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess cravings for the primary substance of addiction (Brief Substance Craving Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of receiving text messages), program midpoint (6 weeks), and program end (12 weeks)., RESULTS: As of October 2020, data collection is in progress; and it is expected to be completed by fall 2021. Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction., CONCLUSIONS: This Text4Hope-Addiction Support project will provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among persons with alcohol and substance use disorders; demographic correlates of cravings, anxiety, and depression; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for addiction care practitioners; it will inform the policy and decision making regarding population-level addiction treatment and support during emergencies., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/22047.

0	Pooling of Upper Respiratory Specimens Using a SARS-CoV-2 Real-time RT-PCR Assay Authorized for Emergency Use in Low-Prevalence Populations for High-Throughput Testing. Background: Nucleic acid amplification testing is a critical tool for addressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Specimen pooling can increase throughput and conserve testing resources but requires validation to ensure that reduced sensitivity does not increase the false-negative rate. We evaluated the performance of a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use for pooled testing of upper respiratory specimens., Methods: Positive specimens were selected from 3 prevalence groups, 1%-3%, >3%-6%, and >6%-10%. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was assessed by pooling single-positive specimens with 3 negative specimens; performance was assessed using Passing-Bablok regression. Additionally, we assessed the distributions of RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for 3091 positive specimens., Results: PPA was 100% for the 101 pooled specimens. There was a linear relationship between Ct values for pooled and single-tested specimens (r = 0.96-0.99; slope = 1). The mean pooled Ct shifts at 40 cycles were 2.38 and 1.90, respectively, for the N1 and N3 targets. The median Cts for 3091 positive specimens were 25.9 (N1) and 24.7 (N3). The percentage of positive specimens with Cts between 40 and the shifted Ct was 1.42% (N1) and 0.0% (N3)., Conclusions: Pooled and individual testing of specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated 100% agreement, which demonstrates the viability of pooled specimens for SARS-COV-2 testing using a dual-target RT-PCR system. Pooled specimen testing can help increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 with a low risk of false-negative results. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Convalescent plasma - Is it useful for treating SARS Co-V2 infection?. The world is challenged with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Although preventive measures such as social distancing, personal protective equipment and isolation would decrease the spread of the infection, a definitive treatment is still under way. Antivirals, immunisation, convalescent plasma (CP) and many more modalities are under trial, and there has been no definite answer to the management of COVID-19 infection. All patients so far have received the standard and symptomatic care. It is shown that the SARS-CoV 2 is a respiratory pathogen, and 80% of the infected patients would recover from the illness and it is the 20% of the infected patients require hospitalisation and even critical care. CP has been used to treat recent epidemic respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections with promising results. The CP of a recovered individual contains antibodies which neutralise the virus and decrease the viral replication in the patient. It is a classic adaptive immunotherapy and has been applied in the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases. CP is plasma taken from a person who has recovered from an infection, which contains neutralising antibodies against the said infection. Giving CP to susceptible individuals or infected patients is a form of passive antibody therapy and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, is expected to provide protection by viral neutralisation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. The adaptive response is to a specific antigen-binding array of molecules that are foreign to the host. The human response to viruses uses both the innate and the adaptive arms in its attempt to rid the host of the invading pathogen. The humoral response is a component of the adaptive immune response that allows for antibodies to bind to foreign invading pathogens, marks the pathogens and their toxins for phagocytosis and recruits further phagocytic cells to the site via the activation of the complement system and eventually prevents the pathogen from infecting target cells. Studies from Wuhan from various institutions during the research on COVID-19 infections during December 2019 have also shown promising results. Till date, randomised controlled studies for the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking, and many countries have invited institutions to participate in clinical trials. The Indian Council of Medical research and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Government of India, have allowed the use of CP as an investigational drug under a trial basis. Internationally, agencies such as the USFDA, American Association of Blood Banks, European Blood Safety and British Blood Transfusion Society have also come out with various guidelines for the use of CP in COVID-19 infection. This article will review the current guidelines for the use of CP and compare the various guidelines of different agencies.	false

0	Infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV2 in a super-spreading event in Germany. A SARS-CoV2 super-spreading event occurred during carnival in a small town in Germany. Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community, this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5% (95% CI:[12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community (3.1%). 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was 0.36% (95% CI:[0.29%; 0.45%]) for the community and 0.35% [0.28%; 0.45%] when age-standardized to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection rate (21.3% versus 9.5%, p < 0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p = 0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics. Whether the super-spreading event not only increases the infection rate but also affects the IFR requires further investigation.	false
0	Upper airway gene expression reveals suppressed immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by peak viral load in the upper airway prior to or at the time of symptom onset, an unusual feature that has enabled widespread transmission of the virus and precipitated a global pandemic. How SARS-CoV-2 is able to achieve high titer in the absence of symptoms remains unclear. Here, we examine the upper airway host transcriptional response in patients with COVID-19 (n = 93), other viral (n = 41) or non-viral (n = 100) acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Compared with other viral ARIs, COVID-19 is characterized by a pronounced interferon response but attenuated activation of other innate immune pathways, including toll-like receptor, interleukin and chemokine signaling. The IL-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are markedly less responsive to SARS-CoV-2, commensurate with a signature of diminished neutrophil and macrophage recruitment. This pattern resembles previously described distinctions between symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infections and may partly explain the propensity for pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19. We further use machine learning to build 27-, 10- and 3-gene classifiers that differentiate COVID-19 from other ARIs with AUROCs of 0.981, 0.954 and 0.885, respectively. Classifier performance is stable across a wide range of viral load, suggesting utility in mitigating false positive or false negative results of direct SARS-CoV-2 tests.	false
0	Prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is putting healthcare workers across the world in an unprecedented situation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the potential factors associated with them. Material(s) and Method(s): A self-designed online questionnaire survey, which consisted of the demographic and selected features, the occupational protection knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19, and the Chinese version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, were used to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. The logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Result(s): A total of 617 pediatric nurses were included in the survey. A considerable proportion of pediatric nurses reported symptoms of depression (95 [15.4%]), anxiety (201 [32.6%]), and stress (111 [18.0%]). Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the good occupational protection practices (for depression: OR = 0.455, 95%CI: 0.281 to 0.739; for anxiety: OR = 0.597, 95%CI: 0.419 to 0.851; for stress: OR = 0.269, 95%CI: 0.166 to 0.438) and the personal protective equipment (PPE) meeting work requirements (for depression: OR = 0.438, 95%CI: 0.246 to 0.778; for anxiety: OR = 0.581, 95%CI: 0.352 to 0.959; for stress: OR = 0.504, 95%CI: 0.283 to 0.898) were independent protective factors against depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Yet, working in an isolation ward or fever clinic was an independent risk factor associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (for depression: OR = 1.809, 95%CI: 1.103 to 2.966; for anxiety: OR = 1.864, 95%CI: 1.221 to 2.846; for stress: OR = 2.974, 95%CI: 1.866 to 4.741). Having suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the departments (OR = 1.554, 95%CI: 1.053 to 2.294) and coming in contact with the patient's bodily fluids or blood (OR = 1.469, 95%CI: 1.031 to 2.095) were independent risk factors for anxiety, while >3 times of training for COVID-19 related information was an independent protective factor for depression (OR = 0.592, 95%CI: 0.360 to 0.974). Moreover, >10 years of working was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 1.678, 95%CI: 1.075 to 2.618). Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 outbreak, a considerable proportion of Hubei pediatric nurses had psychological problems. The pediatric nurses endorsing the higher number of risk factors should be given special attention and necessary psychological intervention.

The pandemic of a novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 has become a real challenge to the mankind and medical community and has raised a number of medical and social issues. Based on the currently available information on COVID-19 clinical cases, it follows that COVID-19 patients in critical condition exhibit a clinical picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock with developing multiple organ failure, which justifies use of anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients. In addition to isolating virus RNA from biological material and polymerase chain reaction diagnostics, use of simple and easily accessible laboratory blood markers is necessary for management of COVID-19 patients. If the activation of coagulation processes is sufficient enough, consumption of platelets and blood clotting factors can be diagnosed by laboratory methods as prolongation of routine blood clotting tests and increasing thrombocytopenia. Hyperfibrinogenemia, increased D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leukocytopenia, increased concentration of interleukin-6 and ferritin are observed in most COVID-19 patients. The degree of increase in these changes correlates with severity of the inflammatory process and serves as a prognostically unfavorable sign. Here we discuss value of laboratory monitoring playing an essential role in such pathological crisis that contributes to patient screening, diagnosis as well as further monitoring, treatment and rehabilitation.Copyright © 2020 Universidad de Antioquia.

0	COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy and Thrombotic Complications. The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a global pandemic within weeks, causing hundreds of thousands of people infected. Many patients with severe COVID-19 present with coagulation abnormalities, including increase D-dimers and fibrinogen. This coagulopathy is associated with an increased risk of death. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 develop sometimes unrecognized, venous, and arterial thromboembolic complications. A better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in particular hemostatic disorders, will help to choose appropriate treatment strategies. A rigorous thrombotic risk assessment and the implementation of a suitable anticoagulation strategy are required. We review here the characteristics of COVID-19 coagulation laboratory findings in affected patients, the incidence of thromboembolic events and their specificities, and potential therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Addictive Disorders: Focus on Opioid Dependence and Opioid Maintenance Treatment-The Bavarian Experience. Background: The covid-19 pandemic challenges patients with severe mental illnesses in many aspects. Curfews, quarantine and isolation are stressors that impair mental wellbeing and can lead to increases in substance use or relapse in patients with substance use disorders. Among the latter, patients with opioid use disorder are particularly vulnerable due to high prevalence of psychiatric or somatic comorbidities. On the other hand, both availability and access to health care is limited during the pandemic, which severely affects patients under opioid maintenance therapy (OMT). Aim(s): This report focusses on the Bavarian experience with opioid dependent patients and OMT. Conclusion(s): Measures to counteract the health risks for this group of patients require the maintenance of OMT facilities under safe conditions in terms of service, hygiene and risk of infection.

0	Automated extraction protocol for quantification of SARS-coronavirus RNA in serum: An evaluation study. Background: We have previously developed a test for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on the detection of the SARS-coronavirus RNA in serum by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automating the serum RNA extraction procedure in order to increase the throughput of the assay. Method(s): An automated nucleic acid extraction platform using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. We developed a modified protocol in compliance with the recommended biosafety guidelines from the World Health Organization based on the use of the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit for the extraction of SARS-coronavirus RNA. The modified protocol was compared with a column-based extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) for quantitative performance, analytical sensitivity and precision. Result(s): The newly developed automated protocol was shown to be free from carry-over contamination and have comparable performance with other standard protocols and kits designed for the MagNA Pure LC instrument. However, the automated method was found to be less sensitive, less precise and led to consistently lower serum SARS-coronavirus concentrations when compared with the column-based extraction method. Conclusion(s): As the diagnostic efficiency and prognostic value of the serum SARS-CoV RNA RT-PCR test is critically associated with the analytical sensitivity and quantitative performance contributed both by the RNA extraction and RT-PCR components of the test, we recommend the use of the column-based manual RNA extraction method. © 2006 Chiu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.	false

0	"Dentistry and Covid-19 pandemic: operative indications post-lockdown. A new Coronavirus, the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread in late December 2019 in the territory of Wuhan in China. CoV-2019 can be transmitted directly from person to person by respiratory drops, direct contact and contaminated material. Furthermore, 2019-nCov penetrates cells similarly to the SARS coronavirus, i.e., through the ACE2 receptor. This may promote human-to-human transmission. Patients and dental professionals are exposed daily to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria, which infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. Dental procedures carry the risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to their specificity. Direct transmission regards the distance between operator and patient, exposure to saliva, blood and other body fluids, the use of sharp instruments and ""droplet-generating"" rotating instruments, contact with the conjunctival mucosa, and finally the contact with droplets produced by coughing and nasal secretion of an infected individual without mask at short distance, increasing the biological risk for the operator. In light of the pandemic linked to Covid-19, although there is no clear scientific evidence in the literature, it is necessary to identify protections with regard to clothing, operating protocols, disinfection of environments and management of waiting rooms and front offices. This paper is a basis for operative indications for dentists and other health care professionals in phase 2 post lock-down for both private and public structures."	false

0	Morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory virus infections in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant: Too little defense or harmful immunity?. The impact on morbidity and mortality of Community Acquired Respiratory Virus (CARV) infections in patients undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) is widely studied. Here we give an overview of the current literature on the incidence and chance of progression to severe disease in this highly immune compromised population. We discuss the issue whether it is predominantly direct viral damage that causes clinical deterioration, or that it is in fact the allogeneic immuneresponse to the virus that is most important. This is an important question as it will guide therapeutic decision making. It asks for further collaborative studies focusing on sensitive surveillance with PCR techniques and relating clinical data with parameters of immune reconstitution.Copyright © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.	false
0	"The Middle East respiratory syndrome-how worried should we be?. Ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travelers from this region. Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV ""a threat to the entire world."" This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered. © 2013 Perlman."	false
0	IFN-gamma protects from lethal IL-17 mediated viral encephalomyelitis independent of neutrophils. Background: The interplay between IFN-gamma, IL-17 and neutrophils during CNS inflammatory disease is complex due to cross-regulatory factors affecting both positive and negative feedback loops. These interactions have hindered the ability to distinguish the relative contributions of neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cell-derived effector molecules from secondary mediators to tissue damage and morbidity. Method(s): Encephalitis induced by a gliatropic murine coronavirus was used as a model to assess the direct contributions of neutrophils, IFN-gamma and IL-17 to virus-induced mortality. CNS inflammatory conditions were selectively manipulated by adoptive transfer of virus-primed wild-type (WT) or IFN-gamma deficient (GKO) memory CD4+ T cells into infected SCID mice, coupled with antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion and cytokine blockade. Result(s): Transfer of GKO memory CD4+ T cells into infected SCID mice induced rapid mortality compared to recipients of WT memory CD4+ T cells, despite similar virus control and demyelination. In contrast to recipients of WT CD4+ T cells, extensive neutrophil infiltration and IL-17 expression within the CNS in recipients of GKO CD4+ T cells provided a model to directly assess their contribution(s) to disease. Recipients of WT CD4+ T cells depleted of IFN-gamma did not express IL-17 and were spared from mortality despite abundant CNS neutrophil infiltration, indicating that mortality was not mediated by excessive CNS neutrophil accumulation. By contrast, IL-17 depletion rescued recipients of GKO CD4+ T cells from rapid mortality without diminishing neutrophils or reducing GM-CSF, associated with pathogenic Th17 cells in CNS autoimmune models. Furthermore, co-transfer of WT and GKO CD4+ T cells prolonged survival in an IFN-gamma dependent manner, although IL-17 transcription was not reduced. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that IL-17 mediates detrimental clinical consequences in an IFN-gamma-deprived environment, independent of extensive neutrophil accumulation or GM-CSF upregulation. The results also suggest that IFN-gamma overrides the detrimental IL-17 effector responses via a mechanism downstream of transcriptional regulation. © 2012 Savarin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.	false
0	Why do influenza virus subtypes die out? A hypothesis. Novel pandemic influenza viruses enter the human population with some regularity and can cause disease that is severe and widespread. The emergence of novel viruses, historically, has often been coupled with the disappearance of existing seasonal virus strains. Here, we propose that the elimination of seasonal strains during virus pandemics is a process mediated, at the population level, by humoral immunity. Specifically, we suggest that infection with a novel virus strain, in people previously exposed to influenza viruses, can elicit a memory B cell response against conserved hemagglutinin stalk epitopes and/or neur-aminidase epitopes. The anti-stalk and/or anti-neuraminidase antibodies then act to diminish the clinical severity of disease caused by novel influenza viruses and to eliminate seasonal virus strains. © 2011 Palese et al.	false

0	Acute Metabolic Emergencies in Diabetes: DKA, HHS and EDKA. Emergency admissions due to acute metabolic crisis in patients with diabetes remain some of the most common and challenging conditions. DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), HHS (Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State) and recently focused EDKA (Euglycaemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) are life-threatening different entities. DKA and HHS have distinctly different pathophysiology but basic management protocols are the same. EDKA is just like DKA but without hyperglycaemia. T1D, particularly children are vulnerable to DKA and T2D, particularly elderly with comorbidities are vulnerable to HHS. But these are not always the rule, these acute conditions are often occur in different age groups with diabetes. It is essential to have a coordinated care from the multidisciplinary team to ensure the timely delivery of right treatment. DKA and HHS, in many instances can present as a mixed entity as well. Mortality rate is higher for HHS than DKA but incidences of DKA are much higher than HHS. The prevalence of HHS in children and young adults are increasing due to exponential growth of obesity and increasing T2D cases in this age group. Following introduction of SGLT2i (Sodium-GLucose co-Transporter-2 inhibitor) for T2D and off-label use in T1D, some incidences of EDKA has been reported. Healthcare professionals should be more vigilant during acute illness in diabetes patients on SGLT2i without hyperglycaemia to rule out EDKA. Middle aged, mildly obese and antibody negative patients who apparently resemble as T2D without any precipitating causes sometime end up with DKA which is classified as KPD (Ketosis-prone diabetes). Many cases can be prevented by following 'Sick day rules'. Better access to medical care, structured diabetes education to patients and caregivers are key measures to prevent acute metabolic crisis.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	The need to shift to a contextualized and collective mental health paradigm: Learning from crisis-hit Lebanon. The impact of national and international crises and disasters on population mental health has been well established, with poorer mental health and a higher incidence of mental disorders documented during war and armed conflict (Charlson et al., 2019), political instability and anti-government protests (Kai Hou et al., 2015), natural disasters (Makwana, 2019), economic crises (Bartoll et al., 2013), mass displacement (Morina et al., 2018), and linked more broadly to inequality, poverty and social injustices (Lund et al., 2010). Following the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health has been highlighted as a global priority in response to the fallout of the crisis, with the toll of lockdown, loss of jobs, increase in domestic violence, and lower social support impacting the wellbeing and functioning of affected populations (Holmes et al., 2020; UNHCR, 2020a; WHO, 2020). Research has shown that such crises, particularly when chronic, have an impact beyond the experience of the individual, affecting the functioning of families, communities, and wider social structures and socio-political systems (Sousa, 2013; Somasundaram, 2014). Despite major advances in the development and implementation of interventions in responding to crises and emergencies, there remain significant gaps in the evidence-base for public mental health responses that are sufficiently contextualized to this collective suffering.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Dysregulation of the immune system as a driver of the critical course of novel coronavirus disease 2019. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, respiratory disease caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making themselves invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibiting the antiviral response of type I interferons, which enhances uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There has been a growing body of evidence showing that fatal hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) responsible for the severe course of COVID-19 is a consequence of massive SARS-CoV-2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, the suppressed antiviral innate immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminant systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 clearly strengthens the evidence for the key role played by the sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (eg, in children, a population with a highly effective innate immune response). Although administration of immunomodulatory drugs is recommended under certain conditions by the guidelines for COVID-19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 still exist. Extending clinicians' knowledge on the dysregulated immune response, which is a driver of the COVID-19 outcome, may improve both therapeutic strategies and the prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 by the Author(s).	false
0	Antibody Detection and Dynamic Characteristics in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been rapidly spreading nationwide and abroad. A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. METHOD(S): The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The serodiagnostic power of the specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and consistency rate. RESULT(S): The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the fourth day after symptom onset. In the patients with confirmed COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, respectively, and those of IgG were 83.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9%. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, respectively, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 and rely on great specificity. CONCLUSION(S): The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stages of the illness. Antibody detection may play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as a complementary approach to viral nucleic acid assays.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Children in Coronaviruses' Wonderland: What clinicians need to know. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses but can lead to more severe and diffusive diseases. A variety of signs and symptoms may be present, and infections can range in severity from the common cold and sore throat to more serious laryngeal or tracheal infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Among the seven coronaviruses that affect humans (SARS)-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the most recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent potential life-threatening diseases worldwide. In adults, they may cause severe pneumonia that evolves in respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Children appear to be less susceptible to develop severe clinical disease and present usually with mild and aspecific symptoms similar to other respiratory infections typical of childhood. However, some children, such as infants, adolescents, or those with underlying diseases may be more at-risk categories and require greater caution from clinicians. Available data on pediatric coronavirus infections are rare and scattered in the literature. The purpose of this review is to provide to clinicians a complete and updated panel useful to recognize and characterize the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections in the pediatric age.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

0	Can SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Continually Persist in an Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patient?. An asymptomatic 39-year-old male patient with well-controlled hypertension on a combination of antihypertensives including angiotensin receptor blocker was screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and was admitted to an isolation facility in Dubai on March 23, 2020. He had a history of exposure to a COVID-19 patient a few days prior to the screening test. His chest X-ray showed signs of pneumonitis. He was discharged from the isolation facility on day 28 with 2 consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR NP swab results, 24 h apart. After 14 days of home quarantine, he tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 on day 44 and was again isolated in our facility. He continued testing positive until day 51, after which he was discharged again following 2 consecutive negative tests 24 h apart. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by S.

0	Half a Loaf is Better than No Bread: Social Media Use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Mainland China. BACKGROUND: In recent years, sudden public health incidents that pose a serious threat to public life have occurred frequently in China. The use of social media by public health authorities has helped to reduce these threats by increasing effective risk communication between the government and the public. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study was to reveal how China's CDC uses social media to improve three aspects of health communication between the government and the public: adoption, operation and interaction. METHOD(S): To analyze the 134 CDC's government Weibo accounts at the provincial and prefecture-level administration regions in mainland China, we collected their account data and extracted 1215 Weibo tweets. we also supplemented the data to reveal the overall performance of CDC's government Weibo usage during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULT(S): The registration rate of the CDC's government Weibo accounts has increased year by year, and the local authorities had registered Weibo accounts before the central government authorities did. In total, 29.8% of the CDC facilities have registered an account, and among the CDC facilities that have registered Weibo accounts, the registration rate in the eastern region (50.7%) is higher than those in the central region (22.4%) and the western region (26.9%). Nearly 90.0% of these Weibo accounts have official certification, but there are dropouts in the specific operating process. One-third of the accounts have not been updated for more than one year, and the number of Weibo followers is polarized, with a maximum and minimum difference of one million. The response rate to users' comments is less than 1%. Emergency information, multimedia content and original content are more helpful in promoting communication between the government and the public. Such interaction was partially improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC updated the daily epidemic situation and provided popular science information for epidemic prevention and control for the public in a timely manner. CONCLUSION(S): China's CDC is using more social media to popularize daily health information and has taken the first step to improve communication between the government and the public. However, equal dialogue, two-way interactions and effective communication with the public still need improvement.	false

0	A novel coronavirus, a novel disease: COVID-19. The novel COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently challenging humankind. This virus originated in bats has probably been transmitted to humans through pangolins in the Wuhan marine market (China) by the end of 2019. It is spread by droplets of saliva or through contaminated materials, making it extremely important to isolate infected people who may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. The typical clinical features of this disease are fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and general malaise. This member of the coronavirus family shows higher infectivity but lower mortality rates (2-3 %) than its predecessors. Laboratory tests to detect the virus include reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests or immunoassays.Copyright © La revista.

0	Prevalence of smell and taste dysfunction in a cohort of CoVID19 outpatients managed through remote consultation from a large urban teaching hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Background: Coronaviruses are known to precipitate disorders of smell and taste function. With the emerging global coronavirus disease (CoVID19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, early reports suggested that smell and taste dysfunction were clinical features of CoVID19. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of smell and taste disturbances in a cohort of CoVID19 positive patients who were isolated at home and being medically managed through telephone consultation. Method(s): This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at St. James's Hospital Dublin, an urban 850 bed tertiary referral centre. 46 out of 50 CoVID19 positive patients, managed through a telephone clinic from the hospital infectious disease department, were assessed for olfactory and gustatory function loss. Result(s): The median age of participants was 36.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 27 - 48) and 19 (41%) were male. The majority (31; 67%) never smoked and 17 (37%) reported co-morbidities. Approximately half of patients reported some degree of smell (22; 48%) or taste (25; 54%) function loss. 13 patients (28%) reported a complete loss of sense of smell, 8 (17%) reported a complete loss of sense of taste and 7 (15%) reported simultaneous total loss of both. The median age of patients with any degree of smell disturbance was significantly lower than patients without (median 30.5 years (IQR 24 - 43.25) versus 41 years (IQR 28.25 - 52.75), p = 0.025). The median age of patients with any degree of taste disturbance was lower than those without, but did not reach statistical significance (median 34 years (IQR 24 - 45) versus 40 years (IQR 27.5 - 52.5) p = 0.174). Conclusion(s): Smell or taste dysfunction were present in our defined subgroup of patients. Further research is required in different population cohorts to build the evidence base for smell and taste dysfunction as clinical indicators of CoVID19 disease and to assess if these symptoms persist after disease resolution.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	6 Lung Ultrasound versus Chest X-ray for the Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia. Study Objectives: The viral illness severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more commonly known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global pandemic infecting over 2 million individuals worldwide. Symptoms are often vague and physical exam findings have proven unreliable as indicators of infection. Therefore, diagnosis typically relies on imaging or nasopharyngeal swabs. The objective of this study was to compare point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) with chest x-ray (CXR) to determine which is the more accurate diagnostic imaging modality for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): This was a single-center, prospective, cohort study at an urban university hospital with >105,000 patient visits annually. Patients >18 years old, who presented to the emergency department (ED) with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were eligible for enrollment. Each patient received a LUS, performed by an emergency medicine resident or emergency physician (EP), using a portable, handheld ultrasound and a portable AP CXR after the LUS was completed. High-risk patients or those with an abnormal imaging finding underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) as the diagnostic standard. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of LUS and of CXR at identifying COVID-19 pneumonia against NCCT as the reference standard. Using a power analysis of 80%, our sample size calculation of 98 patients was based on previous data demonstrating a 20% difference in sensitivities between LUS and CXR at diagnosing pneumonia. Data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data analysis included the chi-square and t tests. Result(s): 143 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were approached and enrolled. 27 patients were considered low risk by the attending EP per ED guidelines, and 6 patients were admitted for alternate diagnoses without advanced imaging. 110 patients underwent LUS, CXR, and NCCT. 99 LUS and 73 CXRs were interpreted as positive. 81 NCCT were interpreted as positive providing a prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia of 75% (95% CI 66.0-83.2) in our study population. Sensitivity of LUS was 97.6% (95% CI 91.6-99.7) vs 69.9% (95% CI 58.8-79.5) for CXR. Specificity was 33.3% (95% CI 16.5-54.0) for LUS and 44.4% (95% CI 25.5-64.7) for CXR. LUS positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.46 (95% CI 1.12-1.92) and 0.0723 (95% CI 0.01-0.31), respectively vs 1.26 (95% CI 0.87-1.81) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.39-1.16) for CXR. PPV and NPV for LUS were 81.8% (95% CI 72.8-88.9) and 81.8% (95% CI 48.2-97.7) compared to 79.5% (95% CI 68.4-88.0) and 32.4% (95% CI 18.0-49.8) for CXR. Conclusion(s): LUS was more sensitive than CXR at identifying COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS using a portable, handheld ultrasound can be a valuable triage screening modality for patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia in diverse clinical settings.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19-associated encephalitis successfully treated with combination therapy. Background: Acute encephalitis can occur in different viral diseases due to infection of the brain or by an immune mechanism. Severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation including interleukin 6 (IL-6). We report a case presenting with acute encephalitis that was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with hyperinflammatory systemic response and recovered after therapy with immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade., Case report: A 39-year-old-man was brought to the Emergency Department with drowsiness, mental disorientation, intermittent fever and headache. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive involvement of the brain including cortical and subcortical right frontal regions, right thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes and cerebral peduncles, with no leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 20/microL (90% lymphocytes), protein level of 198mg/dL, and glucose of 48mg/dL. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) but it was negative in the CSF. Remarkable laboratory findings in blood tests included low lymphocyte count and elevated ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer. He had a complicated clinical course requiring mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were added considering acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The patient made a full recovery, suggesting that it could have been related to host inflammatory response., Conclusion: This case report indicates that COVID-19 may present as an encephalitis syndrome mimicking acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis that could be amenable to therapeutic modulation.

0	Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors in the Bangladeshi population during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online cross-sectional survey. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people. An online survey was conducted among 2,028 people over a period of 10 days on June, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic at a time that the number of newly diagnosed cases was increasing, lockdown was still in place. Survey questions included socio-demographics and an adapted version of the IPAQ-SF to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The prevalence rates of physical inactivity (<600 MET-minutes/week) and high sedentary behaviors (>=8 h/day) among Bangladeshi people were 37.9% and 20.9%, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that young age, being a student, from a middle-class family, or upper-class family, living with nuclear family, urban living, and suffering from no chronic diseases were all associated with physical inactivity and high sedentary behaviors. Moreover, physical inactivity and high sedentary behavior were strongly interrelated. However, many of the univariate risk factors exhibited interdependency. During the COVID-19 pandemic coinciding with lockdown measures a sizeable proportion of Bangladeshi people were physically inactive and reported sedentary behaviors >=8 h/day. Public campaigns and media-based interventions encouraging home-based physical activities should be promoted to attenuate the impact of lockdown measures during a pandemic.

0	A critical appraisal of COVID-19 as a nosocomial infection: An African perspective. The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 19 is not abating since the outbreak began in December 2019. Africa is currently experiencing a surge after an initial low incidence and nosocomial infections could be contributing to this. A dominant factor responsible for this is a weak healthcare system because of many years of neglect due to abysmal budgetary allocation to the sector. The testing capacity for COVID-19 diagnosis in Africa is grossly inadequate coupled with a severe shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate infectious diseases expert. These factors exposed the frontline health workers and patients to the hazard of nosocomial infection with the attendants' morbidity and mortality. Deliberate efforts need to be made toward reducing nosocomial COVID-19 infection.Copyright © Elijah Kolawole Oladipo et al.	false
0	Clinical impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer: Data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19). Background: There are limited data on COVID-19 in patients with cancer. We characterize the outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors. Method(s): The COVID- 19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) cohort study includes patients with active or prior hematologic or invasive solid malignancies reported across academic and community sites. Result(s): We included 1,018 cases accrued March-April 2020. Median age was 66 years (range, 18-90). Breast (20%) and prostate (16%) cancers were most prevalent; 43% of patients were on active anti-cancer treatment. At time of data analysis, 106 patients (10.4%) have died and 26% met the composite outcome of death, severe illness requiring hospitalization, and/or mechanical ventilation. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30- day mortality were age, male sex, former smoking, ECOG performance status (2 versus 0/1: partially adjusted odds ratio (pAOR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.31-5.7; 3/4 versus 0/1: pAOR 5.34, 95% CI 2.44-11.69), active malignancy (stable/responding, pAOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.06-3.5; progressing, pAOR 3.79, 95% CI 1.78-8.08), and receipt of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Tumor type, race/ethnicity, obesity, number of comorbidities, recent surgery, and type of active cancer therapy were not significant factors for mortality. Conclusion(s): All-cause 30-day mortality and severe illness in this cohort were significantly higher than previously reported for the general population and were associated with general risk factors as well as those unique to patients with cancer. Cancer type and treatment were not independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Longer follow-up is needed to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with cancer, including the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.	false
0	No significant association between vitamin D and COVID-19. A retrospective study from a northern Italian hospital. The world is currently overwhelmed by a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinically, COVID-19 shows a broad range of manifestations: from asymptomatic to severe and possibly lethal interstitial pneumonia. Several studies suggested the involvement of Vitamin-D (VitD) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections/severity. However, most of them are based on circumstantial evidences, like the association between latitude-related sunlight exposure and mortality rate, while studies based on patients' VitD measurements are still scarce. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the VitD levels (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D) from a cohort of 347 patients admitted to a northern Italian Hospital as suspected COVID-19s. Of them, 128 were positive (83 males, aged 62.7 +/- 14.2 and 45 females, aged 69.3 +/- 15.6) and 219 were negative (107 males, aged 62.8 +/- 19.5 and 112 females, aged 54.3 +/- 20.1). The averaged VitD levels were similar in the two groups: 21.8 +/- 16.1 ng/mL and 22.8 +/- 14.0 ng/mL for the COVID-19 positive and negative group respectively (p-value: 0.39), as well as the percentage of individuals having VitD levels below 30 ng/mL: 78.9% and 73.5% for the COVID-19 positive and negative group respectively. Because a large portion of patients were below the suggested 30 ng/mL threshold, we can't exclude that VitD supplementation, restoring normal levels, might be beneficial in reducing the risk of infection.

0	Homeopathic Clinical Features of 18 Patients in COVID-19 Outbreaks in Hong Kong. Background Hong Kong is geographically located in the province of Guangdong which, after Hubei, has been the region of China second-most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the pathognomonic symptoms of the named disease, homeopathic symptoms are always more helpful for homeopathic prescriptions. Aim This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 confirmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020. Methods Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to their concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctive measure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, common rubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined. Results Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identified as mild and belonging to one of six separate clusters, are reported. Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n = 4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n = 12). Eight and seven differentiating features, respectively, were identified for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens. Conclusion The common symptoms of 18 mild COVID-19 cases constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures, indicating Bryonia alba or Gelsemium sempervirens; they were indicated in 4 and 12 cases, respectively, out of the 18 in total.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

0	Transmission Dynamics by Age Group in COVID-19 Hotspot Counties - United States, April-September 2020. CDC works with other federal agencies to identify counties with increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspots) and offers support to state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Understanding whether increasing incidence in hotspot counties is predominantly occurring in specific age groups is important for identifying opportunities to prevent or reduce transmission. The percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (percent positivity) is an important indicator of community transmission.* CDC analyzed temporal trends in percent positivity by age group in COVID-19 hotspot counties before and after their identification as hotspots. Among 767 hotspot counties identified during June and July 2020, early increases in the percent positivity among persons aged <=24 years were followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity in persons aged >=25 years. Addressing transmission among young adults is an urgent public health priority.	false
0	Prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19: a Pooled Analysis. There remains a high risk of thrombosis in patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and recent reports have shown pulmonary embolism (PE) as a cause of sudden death in these patients. However, the pooled rate of this deadly and frequently underdiagnosed condition among COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. Given the frequency with which pulmonary embolism has been reported as a fatal complication of severe coronavirus disease, we sought to ascertain the actual prevalence of this event in COVID-19 patients. Using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, a thorough literature search was performed to identify the studies reporting rate of PE among COVID-19. Random effects models were obtained to perform a meta-analysis, and I2 statistics were used to measure inter-study heterogeneity. Among 3066 COVID-19 patients included from 9 studies, the pooled prevalence of PE was 15.8% (95% CI (6.0-28.8%), I2 = 98%). The pooled rate in younger cohort (age < 65 years) showed a higher prevalence of 20.5% (95% CI (17.6-24.8%)) as compared to studies including relatively older cohort (age > 65 years) showing 14.3% (95% CI (2.9-30.1%)) (p < 0.05). Single-center studies showed a prevalence of 12.9% (95% CI 1.0-30.2%), while that of multicenter studies was 19.5% (95% CI 14.9-25.2%) (p < 0.05). Pulmonary embolism is a common complication of severe coronavirus disease and a high degree of clinical suspicion for its diagnosis should be maintained in critically ill patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Induction of a protective immune response to murine coronavirus with non- internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies. Neurotropic murine coronaviruses (MHV) provide an excellent animal model to study experimental modulation of the immune response to a vital pathogen with anti-idiotypic antibodies. It is known that among the various types of anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id), those designated beta (beta) or internal image can molecularly mimic the antigen and induce biological activities such as anti-viral protection and neutralization. We have recently shown that polyclonal non-internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies of the gamma-type could induce protective anti-coronavirus immunity. In the present study, a polyclonal anti-Id (Ab2) was induced against a neutralizing murine monoclonal antibody (MAb1), designated 5B170.11. Mice immunized with this affinity- purified rabbit Ab2(alpha), a non-internal image antibody, were partially protected against lethal infection by the JHM strain of MHV. However, other polyclonal and monoclonal non-internal image Ab2 induced against another neutralizing MAb1, designated 4-11G.6, were not able to protect mice against lethal infection with the A59 strain of MHV. These results demonstrate that anti-viral protection by altering the idiotypic network with non-internal image-bearing anti-idiotype reagents can be achieved even with some anti-Id of the alpha-type.	false
0	Structure of Furin Protease Binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and Implications for Potential Targets and Virulence. The COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global health emergency, and the presence of Furin site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein alters virulence and warrants further molecular, structural, and biophysical studies. Here we report the structure of Furin in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, demonstrating how Furin binds to the S1/S2 region of spike glycoprotein and eventually cleaves the viral protein using experimental functional studies, molecular dynamics, and docking. The structural studies underline the mechanism and mode of action of Furin, which is a key process in host cell entry and a hallmark of enhanced virulence. Our whole-exome sequencing analysis shows the genetic variants/alleles in Furin were found to alter the binding affinity for viral spike glycoprotein and could vary in infectivity in humans. Unravelling the mechanisms of Furin action, binding dynamics, and the genetic variants opens the growing arena of bona fide antibodies and development of potential therapeutics targeting the blockage of Furin cleavage.	false

0	Public health investigations required for protecting the population against novel coronaviruses. There have been many laboratory-based investigations since the emergence of the novel coronaviruses in the autumn of 2012, but most of the parameters required for establishing scientifically the control measures that will protect against them have yet to be determined. Equally, the global distribution of the viruses in their animal reservoir has yet to be established. The experience of investigating and controlling another novel coronavirus, SARS, in 2003 shows how national and local investigations can come together as an international coalition and successfully avert epidemics. A menu of studies that need to be undertaken, especially in the countries experiencing transmission, is presented here.	false
0	Management of the patient with allergic and immunological disorders in the pandemic COVID-19 era. The pandemic COVID-19 abruptly exploded, taking most health professionals around the world unprepared. Italy, the first European country to be hit violently, was forced to activate the lockdown in mid-February 2020. At the time of the spread, a high number of victims were quickly registered, especially in the regions of Northern Italy which have a high rate of highly-polluting production activities. The need to hospitalize the large number of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 led the National Health System to move a large number of specialists from their disciplines to the emergency hospital departments for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, the lockdown itself has limited the possibility for general practitioners and pediatricians to be able to make outpatient visits and/or home care for patients with chronic diseases. Among them, the patient with atopic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, is worthy of particular attention as she/he is immersed in a studded negative scenario with the onset of spring, a factor that should not be underestimated for those who suffer from pollen allergy. The Italian Society of Asthma Allergology and Clinical Immunology, to quickly deal with the lack of references and specialist medical procedures, has produced a series of indications for immunologic patient care that are reported in this paper, and can be used as guidelines by specialists of our discipline.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Nothing noble is accomplished without danger. The global health crisis due to the fast spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused major disruption in all aspects of healthcare. Transplantation is one of the most affected sectors, as it relies on a variety of services that have been drastically occupied to treat patients affected by COVID-19. With this report from two transplant centers in Italy, we aim to reflect on resource organization, organ allocation, virus testing and transplant service provision during the course of the pandemic and to provide actionable information highlighting advantages and drawbacks. To what extent can we preserve the noble purpose of transplantation in times of increased danger? Strategies to minimize risk exposure to the transplant population and health- workers include systematic virus screening, protection devices, social distancing and reduction of patients visits to the transplant center. While resources for the transplant activity are inevitably reduced, new dilemmas arise to the transplant community: further optimization of time constraints during organ retrievals and implantation, less organs and blood products donated, limited space in the intensive care unit and the duty to maintain safety and outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Management of pandemic crisis: COVID-19. The world is threatened with a novel corona virus (COVID-19) which has posed an unpredictable challenge to the public health workforce. It originated from the Wuhan City of China and spread across the globe creating havoc among the public and healthcare workers which led to WHO declaring it to be pandemic. Transmission of this virus is through symptomatic and asymp-tomatic patients in the form of fomites produced while coughing or sneez-ing. This has led to a global crisis subsequently leading to the scarce avail-ability of health care resources such as personal protective equipment, ven-tilators, ICU beds, medication. Healthcare workers have been a vital human resource in providing treatment and assistance to the infected patients though they were facing a high risk of themselves getting infected by the coronavirus. They suffered from fatigue, physical, and psychological violence as they tend to work for longer hours. Detection of infected patients was implemented, as the widely used RT-PCR method was accurate but took more time for the definite results. Hence, for quick results and to detect more number of infected patients, the rapid antigen test was conducted. Therefore, this virus has resulted in a greater impact on the economy and social development and this article of many infected countries.Copyright © 2020, J. K. Welfare and Pharmascope Foundation.

0	Coronavirus disease-2019 or the end of a happy globalization. Recent catastrophic consequences of coronavirus pandemic stimulate some deeper analysis of present level of globalization, particularly connected with public health problems. One definition of globalization may be that it is the integration of capital, technology, and information across national borders in a way that is creating a single global market and, to some degree, a global village. Besides economic, it includes many different processes such as development of communications systems, the increase in human mobility, the integration of trade and investment across boundaries, the spread of democracy and human rights, the increasing role of nongovernmental organizations in international politics, the growing concern about global epidemics, and ecological matters such as climate change that are happening at the same time and in many cases reinforcing one another. Up till now, in June 2020, there have been over 20,000 published scientific papers on Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is an unprecedented level of interest in any topic in the entire history of science. Besides the described effect of remdesivir on reducing the length of the illness and the announced research on the effect of dexamethasone on reducing the mortality rate, science has not offered any other news on medication effectiveness so far. After the vaccine's effectiveness in developing antibodies and protecting from COVID-19 is proven, then its safety will need to be proven. Vaccines have to be harmless and their only effect on the organism should be the developing of permanent immunity to the novel coronavirus. However, never have we in history, as humanity, had planned to simultaneously vaccinate 4 or 5 billion people. Most of us welcomed positive globalization process, but with the recent pandemic of corona disease, we are introducing negative part of globalization with many unpredictable developments. Indeed, globalization is both inevitable and usually desirable and contains advantageous and disadvantageous issues. It is a source of both hope and of apprehension and is an accelerating process in flow of information, technology, goods and services, and production means. Globalization has a complex influence on perinatal health. The bonds that link perinatologists together transcend geographic, political, religious, and lingual differences, resulting in a globalization that optimizes perinatal care.Copyright © The Author(s). 2020.	false
0	Efficacy and safety of transfusing plasma from COVID-19 survivors to COVID-19 victims with severe illness. A double-blinded controlled preliminary study. Background: COVID-19 is highly contagious, potentially deadly current pandemic with no evidence-based cure or vaccines. The efficacy and safety of transfusion plasma of recovered patients were tested to treat patients with severe infection. Method(s): In this preliminary, controlled study, 30 patients were allocated to one of two groups: Standard therapy group (control, n = 15) and recovered COVID-19 plasma group (RCP, n = 15). Control group, received standard therapy alone, while patients allocated to RCP group, were given a single dose,250 ml, of plasma of recovered COVID-19 individuals, plus standard COVID-19 therapy. Neutralizing antibodies and severe COVID-19 serum biomarkers e.g. C-reactive protein, ferritin and d-dimer were measured in all patients before and after transfusion. Our primary outcome was reduction of two or more of a four-category illness-severity scale over 5 days study period: Respiratory frequency >=24/min, blood oxygen saturation <= 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300 mmHg, pulmonary infiltrates >50% of both lungs. Result(s): Plasma of recovered COVID-19 resulted in improvement of laboratory and radiological findings. In RCP group, there was statistically significant improvement of clinical parameters, as well as serum ferritin, D-dimer, c-reactive protein, and the size of lung lesion compared to control group (P <= 0.05). COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies appeared in serum of RCV patients, but failed to show in the control group patients during 5 days study period. Conclusion(s): Plasma of recovered COVID-19 individuals is safe and effective therapeutic modality that significantly accelerated clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	COVID-19 diagnosed by serological antibody test: A case report. The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first reported in Wuhan, China, is causing a pandemic. With an increased understanding of the disease, the diagnosis and treatment guidelines are being updated and improved. In addition to nucleic acid detection, antibody detection kits are also being developed and approved. A medical worker suspected of having COVID-19 in our hospital had fatigue and loss of appetite and pulmonary infection indicated by CT, but the nucleic acid test was negative three times. Finally, she was confirmed to have COVID-19 by a serological antibody test. After rest and oral antiviral treatment, she recovered and returned to work. This is a case report that focuses on suspected mild patients who tested negative for nucleic acids. Such a group of patients had to choose home isolation treatment during the outbreak. The majority of them did not make a definitive diagnosis or rule out COVID-19 by the time they recovered. The antibody test is of great significance to identify infected patients with multiple negative nucleic acid tests. It can complement nucleic acid testing to enhance diagnostic efficiency. We have reviewed the literature and realized that further validation and standardization of serological tests are needed for more mature application of antibody tests to clinical diagnosis and vaccine development.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic of historical proportions, infecting millions of people worldwide. Due to its high mortality rate and a paucity of clinical data, experimental therapies have been utilized with uncertain success and, unfortunately, poor outcomes. We describe a gentleman who was treated with experimental therapies and subsequently developed cytomegalovirus colitis and hypovolemic shock. Additionally, this case validates colonoscopy as a mode to rule out concurrent infectious etiologies causing diarrhea in COVID-19-positive patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Logistic regression combined with ROC curve model to predict risk of critically ill-patients with COVID-19. Objective: To build a model to predict critically ill-patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and provide a new idea for the rapid identification of clinical progression in the early stage of critically ill-patients. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of the general data of 152 general patients and 323 critically ill-patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 17th, 2020 to Feb 25th, 2020 in Wuhan Third Hospital was carried out; At the same time, the differences in fever, blood routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation function, C-reactive protein (CRP), and nucleic acid reagent testing results from the day of admission were statistically analyzed. Factors with statistical significance were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to obtain independent relevant factors that affect the critical ill-patients with COVID-19. Then a prediction model was built based on these factors and its accuracy was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Result(s): The sensitivities of age, fever, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte ratio, serum creatinine (Scr) and combined diagnosis were 0.664, 0.671, 0.607, 0.669, 0.302 and 0.710, respectively; The specificities were 0.669, 0.585, 0.795, 0.685, 0.895 and 0.802, respectively; The area under the curve (AUC) were 0.725, 0.628, 0.721, 0.681, 0.590 and 0.795, respectively; The AUC of combined diagnosis was higher than that of single diagnosis (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The logistic regression and combined with ROC curve model based on multi-factors, including age, fever status, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte ratio, and Scr, can play a good role in predicting the occurrence of critically ill-patients with COVID-19, which is worthy of further promotion and application.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

0	COVID-19: Immune response and therapeutic perspective. Disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is characterized by fever, cough, and affection of the lower respiratory tract. It is associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system. Typically, lymphopenias have been evidenced in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded. For the time being, the best measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is by implementing social isolation, this measure has been adopted by several countries as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Copyright © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

0	Antigenic drift of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus neuraminidase results in reduced effectiveness of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09)-specific antibodies. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines against circulating A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses was modest for several seasons despite the absence of antigenic drift of hemagglutinin (HA), the primary vaccine component. Since antibodies against HA and neuraminidase (NA) contribute independently to protection against disease, an-tigenic changes in NA may allow A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to escape from vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, analysis of the specificities of human NA-specific monoclonal antibodies identified antigenic sites that have changed over time. The impact of these differences on in vitro inhibition of enzyme activity was not evident for polyclonal antisera until viruses emerged in 2013 without a predicted glycosyla-tion site at amino acid 386 in NA. Phylogenetic and antigenic cartography demonstrated significant antigenic changes that in most cases aligned with genetic differ-ences. Typical of NA drift, the antigenic difference is observed in one direction, with antibodies against conserved antigenic domains in A/California/7/2009 (CA/09) continuing to inhibit NA of recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reasonably well. However, ferret CA/09-specific antiserum that inhibited the NA of A/Michigan/45/2015 (MI/15) very well in vitro, protected mice against lethal MI/15 infection poorly. These data show that antiserum against the homologous antigen is most effective and suggest the antigenic properties of NA should not be overlooked when selecting viruses for vaccine production. IMPORTANCE The effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines against circulating A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses has been modest in recent years, despite the absence of antigenic drift of HA, the primary vaccine component. Human monoclonal antibodies identified anti-genic sites in NA that changed early after the new pandemic virus emerged. The reactiv-ity of ferret antisera demonstrated antigenic drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 NA from 2013 on-ward. Passive transfer of serum raised against A/California/7/2009 was less effective than ferret serum against the homologous virus in protecting mice against a virus with the NA of more recent virus, A/Michigan/45/2015. Given the long-standing ob-servation that NA-inhibiting antibodies are associated with resistance against disease in humans, these data demonstrate the importance of evaluating NA drift and suggest that vaccine effectiveness might be improved by selecting viruses for vaccine production that have NAs antigenically similar to those of circulating influenza vi-ruses.Copyright © 2019, American Society for Microbiology.

0	Changes of physical activity and ultra-processed food consumption in adolescents from different countries during covid-19 pandemic: An observational study. Aim: to describe physical activity and ultra-processed foods consumption, their changes and sociodemographic predictors among adolescents from countries in Europe (Italy and Spain) and Latin America (Brazil, Chile, and Colombia) during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic period. Method(s): Cross-sectional study via web survey. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and weekly ultra-processed food consumption data were used. To compare the frequencies of physical activity status with sociodemographic variables, a multinomial logistic and a multiple logistic regression for habitual ultra-processed foods was performed. In final models, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Sample of 726 adolescents, mostly females (59.6%) aged 16-19 years old (54.3%). Adolescents from Latin America presented odds ratio (OR) 2.98 (CI 95% 1.80-4.94) of being inactive and those whose mothers had higher level of education were less active during lockdown [OR 0.40 (CI 95% 0.20-0.84)]. The habitual ultra-processed consumption was also high during this period in all countries, and more prevalent in Latin America. Conclusion(s): A higher prevalence of inactivity was observed in this population, but reductions of physical activity and habitual ultra-processed consumption during the pandemic were more pronounced in Latin America. Our findings reinforce the importance of promoting a healthy lifestyle, i.e., exercise and diet, during periods of social isolation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	The Confluence of Innovation in Therapeutics and Regulation: Recent CMC Considerations. The field of human therapeutics has expanded tremendously from small molecules to complex biological modalities, and this trend has accelerated in the last two decades with a greater diversity in the types and applications of novel modalities, accompanied by increasing sophistication in drug delivery technology. These innovations have led to a corresponding increase in the number of therapies seeking regulatory approval, and as the industry continues to evolve regulations will need to adapt to the ever-changing landscape. The growth in this field thus represents a challenge for regulatory authorities as well as for sponsors. This review provides a brief description of novel biologics, including innovative antibody therapeutics, genetic modification technologies, new developments in vaccines, and multifunctional modalities. It also describes a few pertinent drug delivery mechanisms such as nanoparticles, liposomes, coformulation, recombinant human hyaluronidase for subcutaneous delivery, pulmonary delivery, and 3D printing. In addition, it provides an overview of the current CMC regulatory challenges and discusses potential methods of accelerating regulatory mechanisms for more efficient approvals. Finally, we look at the future of biotherapeutics and emphasize the need to bring these modalities to the forefront of patient care from a global perspective as effectively as possible.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Monitoring life expectancy levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: Example of the unequal impact of the first wave on Spanish regions. Background To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth in Spain and its regions. Methods We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. Results Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.Copyright © 2020 Trias-Llimos et al.

0	The internal open reading frame within the nucleocapsid gene of mouse hepatitis virus encodes a structural protein that is not essential for viral replication. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains a large open reading frame embedded entirely within the 5' half of its nucleocapsid (N) gene. This internal gene (designated 1) is in the +1 reading frame with respect to the N gene, and it encodes a mostly hydrophobic 23-kDa polypeptide. We have found that this protein is expressed in MHV-infected cells and that it is a previously unrecognized structural protein of the virion. To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site-directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination. The start codon for I was replaced by a threonine codon, and a stop codon was introduced at a short interval downstream. Both alterations created silent changes in the N reading frame. In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals. These results demonstrate that I protein is not essential for the replication of MHV either in tissue culture or in its natural host.	false
0	Comparison of effectiveness of whole viral, N and N199 proteins by ELISA for the rapid diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Background: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been controlled, the subsequently emerging sporadic cases in 2004 emphasize the necessity of developing a rapid diagnostic method, which would be of great help in clinical diagosis and also wild host screening. This study aims to establish an effective and rapid serological tool for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV by comparison among whole viral, N and N 199 proteins by ELISA. Method(s): SARS-CoV N and N199 (a truncated nucleocapsid gene) genes were cloned, expressed, identified by Western blotting, and applied in screening of human and swine samples. Sera of SARS convalescent-phase patients, normal human sera, sera of patients with other respiratory diseases, and swine sera were screened by ELISA, with whole SARS-CoV F69, N and N199 proteins as antigens. Result(s): The sensitivity and specificity of N and N199 proteins in human sera diagnosis were approximate (P=0.743), which was higher than whole viral protein but the difference was not significant (P=0.234). The N199 protein proved to be more specific in swine sera screening than whole viral and N protein (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): N199 protein is feasible in both clinical diagnosis and SARS-CoV reservoir screening.	false
0	Premature Death Rate Geography in New York City: Implications for COVID-19. New York City (NYC), in the early stages of the pandemic, had the highest number and incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in US cities. The foundation of this public health catastrophe lies in the overall public health and socioeconomic (SE) structure of the city. Premature (below age 65) mortality rate indicates background public health. In year 2000, community districts (CDs) with low population percent over age 65 had high incidence of HIV mortality and its three associated mortalities (homicide, drugs, liver disease) as well as high poverty rate, high unemployment, low median income, and low percent adults with college or higher degrees. NYC Health Department's use of age 65 as the benchmark for premature death departs from that of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics which uses age 75. This departure contributes to an underestimation of premature mortality rates and of public health deficiencies. This study examines 2017 premature mortality rate of CDs, health outcomes associated with it, and contextual SE factors. Four health outcomes associated with premature mortality rate in multivariate regression: HIV, diabetes, and drug mortality rates and percent of births to teenagers. SE factors associated with premature mortality rate and its health guild were serious housing violations per 1000 units, unemployment rate, poverty rate, percent adults with college or higher degrees (the only negative association), and indicators of segregation. Much of the context of year 2000 patterns of mortality disparities remained in 2017. The coronavirus pandemic plays out in NYC in this SE/public health system. Old age and age-related chronic conditions emerged as raised risks for serious COVID injury and death. Premature mortality indicates a population's rapidity of physiological aging from structural stress: 'weathering'.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Covid-19 pandemic: Through the lens of science, a painstaking review. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has imperiled human lives and global infrastructure since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China. The current review meticulously summarizes the COVID-19 pandemic situation through the lens of science from the inception of the outbreak to the current progression, which is valuable to mitigate the current pandemic situation. Method(s): We reviewed all the relevant literature available on PubMed, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and World Health Organization (WHO) website related to COVID-19 from the inception of the outbreak to 18 June 2020. We selected ninety different scientific studies and reports to compile the current review. Result(s): Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus with four major structural proteins encoded by S, M, E, and N genes and distinct in morphology. The potential provenance of SARS-Cov-2 is zoonotic, and it binds to the host cell receptors by spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle carries on through direct contact, air, inanimate objects, and contaminated surfaces. The reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2 to 3.5, representing that one infected patient can spread this virus to two to three people. An expeditious laboratory diagnosis has a pivotal role in patient management and prevention. Due to the lack of definitive treatment, symptomatic medication regimen and supportive organ therapies are adapted for debilitated patients. Conclusion(s): Nucleoside analogs and protease-inhibitors have approved to attenuate the viral infection until the discovery of a specific drug. The other treatment strategies comprise antimalarial drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and glucocorticoids. The use of alcoholic scrubs, sodium hypochlorite, masks, social distancing, and quarantine the affected individual is inevitable to eradicate the infection vector and to break the transmission path.©Copyright	false
0	Differences in Performance Characteristics Among Four High-Throughput Assays for the Detection of Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Using a Common Set of Patient Samples. OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has experienced a changing landscape of available assays coupled with uncertainty surrounding performance characteristics. Studies are needed to directly compare multiple commercially available assays., METHODS: Residual serum samples were identified based on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, clinical test results, and collection dates. Serum samples were analyzed using assays from four different manufacturers: DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assays., RESULTS: Samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients became increasingly positive as time from symptom onset increased. For patients with latest sample 14 or more days after symptom onset, sensitivities reached 93.1% to 96.6%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for EUROIMMUN, Roche, and Siemens assays, respectively, which were superior to the DiaSorin assay at 87.7%. The specificity of Roche and Siemens assays was 100% and superior to DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays, which ranged from 96.1% to 97.0% and 86.3% to 96.4%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories should be aware of the advantages and limitations of serology testing options for SARS-CoV-2. The specificity and sensitivity achieved by the Roche and Siemens assays would be acceptable for testing in lower-prevalence regions and have the potential of orthogonal testing advantages if used in combination.

0	Evaluation of a novel multiplexed assay for determining IgG levels and functional activity to SARS-CoV-2. Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of serological assays that could aid in an understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease. Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay. Methods: A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019. Results: The specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4 % and sensitivity of 96.2 % for samples taken 14 days and 97.9 % for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay. Conclusion: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality.	false

At the start of the UK COVID-19 epidemic, this rare point prevalence study reveals 1/3 of patients in a London inpatient rehabilitation unit were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but asymptomatic (n=15/45). We report on eight patients in detail, including their clinical stability, the evolution of their nasopharyngeal viral RT-PCR burden and their antibody levels over time revealing the infection dynamics by RT-PCR and serology during the acute phase. Notably, a novel serological test for antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (anti-RBD) showed 100% of our asymptomatic cohort remained seropositive between 3 to 6 weeks post-diagnosis.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Exploring the genetics, ecology of sars-cov-2 and climatic factors as possible control strategies against covid-19. The world has been thrown into pandemonium due to the recent Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Early available clinical data have indicated that geriatric persons cum those with comorbidity such as cardiovascular, metabolic and immunological disorders suffered severe form of COVID-19. All countries and territories of the world are currently exploring available strategies to control the pandemic with the hope to significantly minimize its morbidity and mortality rate. This present study critically reviewed available and latest research progress on the genetics and ecology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the influence of climatic factors on the spread of COVID-19, and thus, discussed how these concepts could be harnessed for COVID-19 control and further scientific advancements in resolving the pandemic.Copyright © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

0	Management of Patients With Hematologic Malignancies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Practical Considerations and Lessons to Be Learned. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented hurdles to the delivery of care to patients with cancer. Patients with hematologic malignancies appear to have a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease due to myelosuppression and lymphopenia. The first challenge, therefore, is how to continue to deliver effective, curative therapy to vulnerable patients and at the same time avoid exposing them, and their health care teams (HCT), to SARS-CoV-2. An additional challenge is the timely completion of the diagnostic and staging studies required to formulate appropriate treatment plans. Deferred procedures and avoidance of multiple trips to the surgical, diagnostic, and laboratory suites require same day consolidation of all procedures. With laboratory medicine absorbed by the need to deploy large scale COVID-testing, the availability of routine molecular tests is affected. Finally, we are increasingly faced with the challenge of making complex treatment decisions in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with aggressive but potentially curable blood cancers. When to treat, how to treat, when to wait, how long to wait, how to predict and manage toxicities, and how to avoid compromising cure rates remains unknown. We present an outline of the scientific, medical, and operational challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic at selected American and European institutions and offer our current view of the key elements of a response. While the peak of the pandemic may be past us, in the absence of a vaccine risks remain, and our alertness and response to future challenges need to be refined and consolidated.© Copyright © 2020 Isidori, de Leval, Gergis, Musto and Porcu.	false
0	COVID-19: Diagnostic Testing and Challenges. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Following this, there has been a rapid development in policies and strategies to contain and mitigate the pandemic. One of such strategies involves the development and utilization of testing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of COVID-19.

0	Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients in Xiaogan City. On February 6, 2020, Xiaogan City became the second most seriously affected city with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), outside Wuhan district, Hubei Province, China. The objectives are to study the clinical features of COVID-19 patients and assess the relationship between the severity of COVID-19, age, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The retrospective data of 134 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 3 hospitals of Xiaogan City, between February 1 and March 1, 2020, was collected. This study documented COVID-19 patients. Clinical data in terms of body temperature, history of travel, and direct contact with COVID-19 patients, and incubation period was collected. Out of the 134 patients, only 5 required intensive care. Moreover, 2 patients succumbed during this period. The median age of patients was 45 (33-56) years. The most common symptoms at the onset of disease were fever (66.4%), cough (33, 6%), and sore throat (14.7%). Amongst the medicines used, antiviral agents (92.3%) followed by the traditional Chinese medicine (89.5%) were most commonly used. In both the crude and adjusted (I to III) models, odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval for both age and CRP levels were > 1. Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of COVID-19 was positively correlated with both age and CRP levels (all P value < 0.05). The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fairly moderate. The health care professionals treating the COVID-19 patients should be aware of the increased likelihood of progression to severe COVID-19 in elderly patients and those with high CRP levels.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false

0	Adverse events in coronavirus disease patients management: A pictorial essay. Clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) varies from asymptomatic to severe clinical forms that can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome or in multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There are no guidelines, based on randomized controlled trials, for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The treatment is based on antiviral drugs, invasive and non-invasive ventilation supports, and anticoagulant therapy. This is a pictorial essay covering the multiple adverse events encountered during the treatment of COVID-19 patients in an area with a high pandemic incidence. Adverse events are defined as unexpected events following treatment for the infection. The cases described would be useful in aiding early diagnosis, limiting and improving the management of serious complications for patients, and allowing rapid and appropriate treatment.Copyright © 2020 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Journal of Clinical Imaging Science	false
0	5 Burden of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest in New York City during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Study Objectives: As of June 10, 2020, there have been 17,300 confirmed and an additional 4,693 suspected COVID related-deaths in New York City (NYC). While much attention was given to the overwhelming burden on hospitals and skilled nursing facilities during the pandemic, it is less well known how the pandemic impacted EMS systems and rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). The NYC Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) is responsible for oversight and quality in out-of-hospital care in NYC. This study's primary objective was to assess the burden of cardiac arrest in during the pandemic. Method(s): This observational study uses aggregate data from the New York City region collected through the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS). Daily counts of cardiac arrest incidents stratified by each of the five boroughs (geographical divisions) in NYC and by final disposition (eg, transported to the hospital or pronounced on scene) were obtained for the time periods of February 2020 through April 2020, and for the same time period in the final year. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and compare the daily counts of cardiac arrests and the proportion of patients pronounced in the field between the current year during the pandemic time period and the corresponding time period in 2019. This study was determined to be exempt by the Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board. Result(s): In NYC during the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS experienced a 220% increase in cardiac arrest call responses in February - April, 2020 (8,837) compared to February - April, 2019 (4,022), peaking on April 6 at 330 cases in a single day. (See Figure 1). During this period, the Bronx experienced the highest rate of increase at 243% higher in 2020 compared to Queens (238% increase), Kings (231%), New York (184%) and Richmond (143%). For all of NYC, the rate of transport for OOHCA decreased during this time period from 37% in February-April 2019 to 16% in February-April 2020. Conclusion(s): There was exponential growth of the rate of OOHCA during the initial phase of the pandemic in NYC and there was a sustained increase through the month April 2020. With a 220% increase in cases over the course of three months and over a 780% (42 to 330 cases) increase on the highest day of OOHCA, and in light of a concurrent burden on NYC hospitals, our EMS system experienced an unprecedented demand for critical care and resuscitation. Further studies are needed to better understand to what degree the increased in OOHCA was attributed to the disease itself, or due to delaying needed care for other conditions. In planning for future pandemics, strategic planning should include consideration of impacts on operations and capacity of the regional EMS system. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	19 Factors Associated with County-Level SARS-CoV-2 Testing Volume in Nine States. Study Objectives: Rigorous SARS-CoV-2 testing is an important public health measure as it leads not only to early identification and prevention of transmission, but also to optimization of emergency care and resource allocation. Yet, the US has experienced a significant burden of illness, with reports suggesting a disproportionate amount falling on racial/ethnic minorities. Despite the public health importance, little is known about the discrepancies in the testing rate by region and race/ethnicity. In this context, we investigated the differences in and factors associated with per capita testing volumes. Method(s): This is an analysis of population-based data of nine racially/ethnically and geographically diverse states (AL, AZ, DE, FL, IN, NV, OR, TN, TX). We analyzed county-level testing data reported by state health departments and sociodemographic data reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. All data are as of June 7, 2020. The outcome was the number of SARS-CoV-2 testing (PCR and/or serology) per 1,000 individuals at the county-level. To identify factors associated with outcome, we fit a multivariable Poisson regression model including states, county-level death rate, mean household income, and proportion of major races/ethnicities. Result(s): We examined data from 646 counties from nine states. The median rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing per 1,000 individuals differed widely, ranging from 15 in Texas to 54 in Delaware (Table). The multivariable model identified factors significantly associated with the rate of testing-state, death rate per 1,000, % non-Hispanic white, % non-Hispanic black, and % Hispanic (all P<0.05). For example, compared to Texas, higher testing rates were observed in Delaware (rate ratio [RR], 2.47) and Tennessee (RR, 2.92). In contrast, the magnitude of race/ethnicity-outcome association was smaller-eg, RR of 0.96 per 10% increase in non-Hispanic black and 0.85 per 10% increase in Hispanic demographics. Conclusion(s): There were significant between-state differences in the SARS-CoV-2 testing rate. Counties with a higher proportion of race/ethnicity minorities had significantly lower testing rates while their magnitude of association was relatively small. Our findings should facilitate further investigations into the reasons for discrepancies, which will, in turn, optimize prevention and treatment strategies against this public health emergency.

0	63 Incidence and Determinants of COVID-19 Emergency Department Revisits. Study Objectives: Emergency department (ED) revisits are associated with significant resource utilization. Accordingly, revisits serve as an important quality measure for emergency care. In recent times, EDs have been challenged by critical resource constraints in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. When appropriate, medically stable COVID-19 patients are discharged home rather than admitted for further care. However, the natural history of COVID-19 is not well understood and patients may quickly progress to requiring medical attention. To our knowledge, ED revisits have not been previously characterized in the setting of COVID-19. We aim to quantify the incidence of, as well as determine risk factors for, ED revisits for COVID-19 patients. Method(s): We conducted retrospective study of 323 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented to a single academic tertiary-care institution from March 15 to April 15 of 2020. Demographic and clinical information was abstracted from the electronic medical record. Predictor variables (age, history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, current tobacco or marijuana use) were selected based on current knowledge of risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. All return visits to the ED within 28 days of index ED presentation were classified as revisits. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent demographic and clinical risk factors for ED revisits. We also performed exploratory univariable analyses of a subset of 179 patients who had measured serum biomarkers (absolute neutrophil count (ANC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) in order to identify potential biochemical risk factors for ED revisits. Result(s): Of the 323 patients studied, 98 were discharged from the ED during their index visit and 225 were admitted to the hospital. Among those discharged, 25/98 (25.5%) returned within 28 days of index ED presentation. Median time to revisit was 3 days (interquartile range (IQR): 2 to 7). Among those admitted during their index visit (median hospital length of stay: 6 days), 26/225 (11.6%) returned within 28 days of index ED presentation. Median time to revisit for this group was 14.5 days (IQR: 5 to 22). Cumulative incidence of ED revisits was 15.8% (95% CI: 12.2 to 20.2). Patients with and without ED revisits were similar across demographic and clinical variables examined, with the exceptions of tobacco or marijuana use and history of COPD. Both tobacco or marijuana use (odds ratio (OR): 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and history of COPD (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1 to 8.8) were found to be independent risk factors for ED revisits. In our exploratory analysis of patients with biomarker data, ANC (OR: 0.808, 95% CI: 0.689 to 0.948), ALT (OR: 0.973, 95% CI: 0.953 to 0.993), and LDH (OR: 0.996, 95% CI: 0.992 to 0.999) were found to be associated with ED revisits. Conclusion(s): The incidence of ED revisits in our COVID-19 cohort was 15.8% (95% CI: 12.2 to 20.2). Risk factors for revisits included current tobacco or marijuana use and history of COPD. Preliminary study suggests the utility of serum biomarker data in helping to stratify revisit risk. In future analysis we will determine the reasons for ED revisits as well as develop a model for identifying those at risk for ED revisits.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"163 Implementation of a Telephonic-Based Model to Continue to Address Substance Use as Part of Usual Care in Emergency Departments during COVID-19. Study Objectives: Alcohol is associated with increased risk of hypertension and diabetes, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, as are opioids and methamphetamine. Our institution has a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program in 18 emergency departments (EDs), 14 inpatient hospitals, and 5 primary care sites to universally address substance use with patients as part of usual care. As our region has a high prevalence of COVID-19, we had to minimize staff presence in the ED, including health coaches and social workers who normally work with patients with a positive SBIRT screen. The COVID-19 crisis demanded innovation; we implemented a ""Telephonic SBIRT"" (T-SBIRT) model to continue to address patients' substance use in the context of physical and mental health while minimizing in-person interactions. Method(s): Due to regulations regarding ""non-essential"" staff, 11 SBIRT Health Coaches were removed from their ED and primary care sites. Health Coaches were assigned to T-SBIRT where a central phone number forwards to the mobile phone of the remote health coach on duty. Shifts cover 8am-12am, 7 days per week. We developed a flyer with the services, hours, and phone number and broadly disseminated to ED chairs, primary care providers, nurse managers, all hospital social workers, the Health Home team, and others via virtual meetings and email. We developed a HIPAA-compliant Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) form for Health Coaches to use to document services, including the questions for AUDIT (alcohol) and DAST-10 (drug) full screens and checkboxes for brief interventions, referrals to treatment, and virtual resources provided (AA/NA, BottleCap for reducing alcohol use, tobacco cessation, etc). We developed a system via REDCap where the Health Coach emailed the caller the resource list from a central email address in real time. Finally, we developed a REDCap form to virtually obtain HIPAA consent to enroll participants in our substance use disorder care navigation program (Project CONNECT). Result(s): In 13 weeks, we had 422 phone calls, 228 (54%) incoming, 190 (45%) outgoing, and 4 (1%) voicemails. 108 (26%) of calls were with patients, 13 (3%) with family/friends, 224 (53%) with staff members, and 79 (19%) with treatment providers. Calls stemmed from 14 hospitals, 2 primary care practices, and Health Home. We worked with 69 unique staff members and 94 unique patient cases, 75 (81%) male, 20 (19%) female, and 7 (8%) in Spanish. We provided 73 full screens, (91% high-risk), 47 brief interventions, referrals for 84 patients, emailed virtual resources to 40 individuals, and enrolled 16 patients in Project CONNECT. Conclusion(s): We were able to have a health coach provide T-SBIRT services for patients from sites that do not normally have a health coach, and cover weekends and later hours. Since calls received were for patients with high-risk substance use in need of a referral to substance use disorder treatment, more frontline provider education is needed on the ability of the T-SBIRT Team to address the full spectrum of substance use, not just high-risk substance use. In conclusion, T-SBIRT is a model that we plan to sustain to continually expand reach, and to provide services to address substance use as part of usual care with patients at more locations than we could otherwise physically staff.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	"Systematic review of laboratory parameters predicting severity and fatality of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. Background: We reviewed studies that reported changes in laboratory parameters in COVID-19 hospitalised patients to identify those parameters that predict disease severity with a high degree of sensitivity to aid early clinical decision which is essential for timely triaging of patients. Method(s): An electronic search of four databases comprising PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, AJOL and JSTOR was performed to identify studies reporting changes in laboratory parameters in COVID-19 patients using key words ""laboratory"" OR ""haematological"" OR ""cardiac"" and ""coronavirus 2019"" OR ''COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"". Result(s): A total of twenty-eight articles were reviewed out of 593 identified after duplicates removal. These 28 articles comprise 2,688 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients comprising 1,418 male and 1,270 female patients with 32 different laboratory parameters identified. Comparing the mild to severe/critical cases our result showed a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (100%), D-dimer (100%), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (100%) as well as lymphocytopenia (96.0%), thrombocytopenia (83.3%), leukocytosis (71.4%) and neutrophilia (86.4%). Severe cases of COVID-19 had increased serum levels of myoglobin, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, urea, creatinine, cystatin C, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, international normalised ratio (NLR), platelet count, fibrin degradation products; and decreased levels of Hb, fibrinogen, uric acid, blood gases (PaO2 and PaCO2), and oxygenation index. Conclusion(s): The observations in this study provide evidence of multiple organ involvement in COVID-19 disease. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets, fibrinogen, NLR, oxygen index, and blood gases should be considered important in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 outcome in hospitalised patients.Copyright © 2020 The authors."	false
0	The new normal dentistry in the COVID-19 pandemic world. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease mostly with the symptoms of pneumonia cropped out in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 outbreak has spread out worldwide and it has created huge uncertainty. COVID-19 was announced by the World Health Organization as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, with infection cases occurring in 185 countries all over the world. There is no clear information about how long this pandemic will continue whether its different types will be seen, or whether it will reappear in the future. Dentists are in close contact with patients' blood, aerosol, droplet, and saliva during dental procedures. Therefore, dentists are at a high risk of being infected with COVID-19. During dental procedures, COVID-19 can be transmitted through inhalation of aerosols from an infected person or through contact with mucous membranes, oral fluids, contaminated instruments, and surfaces. The aim of this article is to collect all information about the COVID-19 outbreak that dentists should be aware of when they perform the dental practice.Copyright © 2020, Derman Medical Publishing.

0	Unfractionated heparin inhibits live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently there are no licensed vaccines and limited antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined. KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 mug ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

We describe scalable and cost-efficient production of full length, His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer by CHO cells that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient sera at high specificity and sensitivity. Transient production of spike in both HEK and CHO cells mediated by PEI was increased significantly (up to 10.9-fold) by a reduction in culture temperature to 32C to permit extended duration cultures. Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in ELISA format to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by PCR, including those who had displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The antibody assay, validated to ISO 15189 Medical Laboratories standards, exhibited a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 92.3%. Our data show that CHO cells are a suitable host for the production of larger quantities of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimer which can be used as antigen for mass serological testing.

0	Performance evaluation of five ELISA kits for detecting anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG antibodies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the performances of five commercial ELISA assays (EDI, AnshLabs, Dia.Pro, NovaTec, and Lionex) for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. METHOD(S): 70 negative control samples (collected before the COVID-19 pandemic) and samples from 101 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected at different time points from symptoms onset: <=7, 8-14, and >14 days) were used to compare the sensitivity, specificity, agreement, positive and negative predictive values of each assay with RT-PCR. A concordance assessment between the five assays was also conducted. Cross-reactivity with other HCoV, non-HCoV respiratory viruses, non-respiratory viruses, and nuclear antigens was investigated. RESULT(S): Lionex showed the highest specificity (98.6%, 95%CI: 92.3-99.8), followed by EDI and Dia.Pro (97.1%, 95%CI: 90.2-99.2), NovaTec (85.7%, 95%CI: 75.7-92.1), then AnshLabs (75.7%, 95%CI: 64.5-84.2). All ELISA kits cross-reacted with one anti-MERS IgG positive sample except Lionex. The sensitivity was low during the early stages of the disease but improved over time. After 14 days from symptoms onset, Lionex and NovaTec showed the highest sensitivity at 87.9% (95%CI: 72.7-95.2) and 86.4% (95%CI: 78.5-91.7), respectively. The agreement with RT-PCR results based on Cohen's kappa was as follows: Lionex (0.89)> NovaTec (0.70)> Dia.Pro (0.69)> AnshLabs (0.63)> EDI (0.55). CONCLUSION(S): The Lionex ELISA, which measures antibodies solely to the S1 protein, demonstrated the best performance.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

OBJECTIVES: Describe and evaluate the outcome of COVID patient without shortness of breath DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed and cared for in Marseille France. We selected data from patients who had at admission, a low dose CT scanner, dyspnea status and oxygen saturation available. Blood-gas was analyzed in a sample subset of patients. RESULT(S): Among 1712 patients with COVID-19 we report that 1107 (64.7%) do not complaint of a shortness of breath at admission. The LDCT scan showed signs compatible with pneumonia in 757/1,107 (68.4%) of patients without dyspnea. In a subset of patients who had underwent at least one blood gas analysis (n=161) and presented without dyspnea at admission, 28.1% (27/96) presented with a hypoxemia/hypocapnia syndrome. Asymptomatic hypoxia was associated with a very poor outcome (33.3% were transferred to ICU and 25.9% died) CONCLUSION(S): The absence of shortness of breath in old patient with co-morbidity merit medical attention and should not be considered as a good sign of wellbeing. The poor prognosis of asymptomatic hypoxia, highlight the severity of this mild clinical presentation. In these patient's pulse oximetry is an important mean to predict the outcome along with news score and LDCT scanner.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Determinants of COVID-19 disease severity in patients with underlying rheumatic disease. Background: Over the month of April, Spain has become the European country with more confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, after surpassing Italy on April 2nd. The community of Castile and Leon in Spain is one of the most affected by COVID-19 infection and the province of Leon has a total of 3711 cases and 425 deaths so far. Rheumatic patients should be given special attention regarding COVID-19 infection due to their immunocompromised state resulting from their underlying immune conditions and use of targeted immune-modulating therapies. Studying epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with SARS-CoV2 is pivotal to clarify determinants of COVID-19 disease severity in patients with underlying rheumatic disease. Objective(s): To describe epidemiological characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and determine risk factors associated with mortality in a third level Hospital setting in Leon, Spain. Method(s): We performed a prospective observational study, from 1st March 2020 until the 1st of June including adults with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and performed a univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of mortality. Age, sex, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis and treatment, disease activity prior to infection, radiographic and laboratorial results at arrival were analysed. Result(s): During the study period, 3711 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital, of whom 38 (10%) had a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease. Fifty-three percent were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 75.3 (IQR 68-83) years. The median length of stay was 11 days. A total of 10 patients died (26%) during their hospital admission. Patients who died from COVID-19 were older (median age 78.4 IQR 74.5-83.5) than those who survived COVID-19 (median age 75.1 IQR 69.3-75.8) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (9 [90%] vs 14 [50%] patients; OR 9 (95% CI 1.0-80.8), p 0.049), dyslipidaemia (9 (90%) vs 12 (43%); OR 12 (95% CI 1.33-108), p 0.03), diabetes ((9 (90%) vs 6 (28%) patients; OR 33, p 0.002), interstitial lung disease (6 (60%) vs 6 (21%); OR 5.5 (95% CI 1.16-26), p 0.03), cardiovascular disease (8 (80%) vs 11 (39%); OR 6.18 (95% IC 1.10-34.7, p 0.04) and a moderate/high index of rheumatic disease activity (7 (25%) vs 6(60%); OR 41.4 (4.23-405.23), p 0.04). In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from COVID-19 had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: C-reactive protein (181 (IQR 120-220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30-150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75-853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250-450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3-1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389-1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5-25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619-1622), p 0.04). No differences in sex, radiological abnormalities, rheumatological disease, background therapy or symptoms before admission between deceased patients and survivors were found. In the multivariate analysis, the following risk factors were associated with mortality: rheumatic disease activity (p = 0.003), dyslipidaemia (p = 0.01), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.02) and interstitial lung disease (p = 0.02). Age, hypertension and diabetes were significant predictors in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. Rheumatic disease activity was significantly associated with fever (p = 0.05), interstitial lung disease (p = 0.03), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.03) and dyslipidaemia (p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that comorbidities, rheumatic disease activity and laboratorial abnormalities such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum ferritin elevation significantly associated with mortality whereas previous use of rheumatic medication did not. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19.Key Points* Most patients recover from COVID-19.* The use of DMARDs, corticosteroids and biologic agents did not increase the odds of mortality in our study.* Rheumatic disease activity might be associated with mortality.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).	false

Background: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was firstly reported in Wuhan, China, with cases now confirmed in more than 100 countries. However, COVID-19 pneumonia with spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown. Case presentation: We reported a case of 66-year-old man infected with COVID-19, presenting with fever, cough and myalgia; The patient received supportive and empirical treatment including antiviral treatment, anti-inflammatory treatment, oxygen supply and inhalation therapy; The symptoms, CT images, laboratory results got improved after the treatments, and a throat swab was negative for COVID-19 PCR test; However, on the hospital day 30, the patient presented with a sudden chest pain and dyspnea. CT showed a 30-40% left-sided pneumothorax. Immediate thoracic closed drainage was performed and his dyspnea was rapidly improved. With five more times negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus, the patient was discharged and home quarantine. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the importance for clinicians to pay attention to the appearance of spontaneous pneumothorax, especially patients with severe pulmonary damage for a long course, as well as the need for early image diagnose CT and effective treatment once pneumothorax occurs.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Profile of children with COVID-19 infection: a cross sectional study from North-East Nigeria. Introduction: available evidence suggests that children infected with COVID-19 tend to have a less severe form of the disease. However, most of the studies that have established this largely emanate from outside sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic nature of the infection makes it instructive to evaluate its pattern among children across different climes, including ours. This study was set out to describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Bauchi State, North-East Nigeria., Methods: this was a cross sectional study that involved 53 children between the ages of 0 and 18 years, who had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection between March and June 2020 in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Data on epidemiological and clinical characteristics was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V 21. R Relationship between categorical variables was established using the chi square test. The level of statistical significance was set at < 0.05, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%., Results: the mean age was 12.63 +/- 4.31 years with a slight preponderance of males (1.1: 1). Majority were asymptomatic (60.4%), while 32.1% and 7.5% had mild and moderate diseases respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (20.8%), fever (17%), and sneezing (15.1%). Five children (9.4%) complained of loss of taste while anosmia was documented in one child (1.9%). We observed a significant relationship between age category and the presence of symptoms. In fact, children younger than 10 years (pre-adolescents) were five times more likely to be symptomatic when compared to those above this age (p = 0.029, C I 1.08-21.56)., Conclusion: our findings have shown a mild pattern of disease and good outcome among infected children. However, we must be mindful of the higher vulnerability among younger children, especially those below 10 years. Copyright: Idris Abiodun Adedeji et al.	false
0	Diagnostic Yield of Computed Tomography for the Identification of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Using Repeated Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing or Confirmed True-Negative State as Reference Standard: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic yield of computed tomography (CT) for the identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using repeated reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing or confirmed true-negative state as reference standard., METHODS: In May 2020, we interrogated the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios of CT for COVID-19 identification were computed. Cumulative positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value, stratified by disease prevalence, were calculated., RESULTS: Ten articles were included (1332 patients). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary diagnostic odds ratio of CT were 82% [95% confidence interval (CI), 79%-84%], 68% (95% CI, 65%-71%), and 18 (95% CI, 9.8-32.8). The PPV and negative predictive value were 54% (95% CI, 30%-77%) and 94% (95% CI, 88%-99%) at a COVID-19 prevalence lower than 40%, and 80% (95% CI, 62%-91%) and 77% (95% CI, 68%-85%) at a prevalence higher than 40%., CONCLUSION: CT yields higher specificity and PPV, albeit lower sensitivity, than previously reported for the identification of COVID-19.	false
0	A gendered magnifying glass on COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemia is affecting Countries worldwide with a gendered death excess as being a male represents, especially in the 50-69 years age group, an unfavourable factor. Females are constitutionally prone to defend themselves against pathogens with a stronger efficiency than males. As a fact, several genes involved into the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response are strategically placed on the X-chromosome and, among them, pathogen-related receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 7, suitable to recognize ssRNAs and trigger a gendered successful anti-viral fight. On the other hand, a more regulated IL-6 production and a more contained inflammation after the encounter of a pathogen supply score points in favour of the female sex in the view that an abnormal and exaggerated cytokine release does represent the hallmark of the deathful SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sex-prevalent expression of the attachment and permissive molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 further supports the concept of a male-oriented vulnerability. In this review, the possible role of biological and immunological sex differences into the higher morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 between females and males are discussed.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Clinical analysis of 132 cases COVID-19 from Wuhan. Numerous cases of pneumonia from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China during December 2019.We determined the correlations of patient parameters with disease severity in patients with COVID-19.A total of 132 patients from Wuhan Fourth Hospital who had COVID-19 from February 1 to February 29 in 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.Ninety patients had mild disease, 32 had severe disease, and 10 had critical disease. The severe/critical group was older (P < .05), had a higher proportion of males (P < .05), and had a greater mortality rate (0% vs 61.9%, P < .05). The main symptoms were fever (n = 112, 84.8%) and cough (n = 96, 72.7%). Patients were treated with antiviral agents (n = 94, 71.2%), antibiotics (n = 92, 69.7%), glucocorticoids (n = 46, 34.8%), intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 38, 27.3%), and/or traditional Chinese medicine (n = 40, 30.3%). Patients in the severe/critical group received mechanical ventilation (n = 22, 16.7%) or high-flow nasal can-nula oxygen therapy (n = 6, 4.5%). Chest computed tomography (CT) indicated bilateral pneumonia in all patients. Relative to the mild group, the severe/critical group had higher levels of leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), liver enzymes, and myocardial enzymes (P < .05), and decreased levels of lymphocytes and blood oxygen partial pressure (P < .05).The main clinical symptoms of patients from Wuhan who had COVID-19 were fever and cough. Patients with severe/critical disease were more likely to be male and elderly. Disease severity correlated with increased leukocytes, CRP, PCT, BNP, D-dimer, liver enzymes, and myocardial enzymes, and with decreased lymphocytes and blood oxygen partial pressure.	false
0	Impact of cancer on mortality and severity of corona virus disease 2019: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are in a state of systemic immunosuppression and are considered a highly vulnerable population in the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. However, the relationship between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether cancer patients with COVID-19 may be at an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. METHOD(S): We will perform comprehensive searches in PubMed, EMBASE.com, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies providing prevalence of cancer between patients with severe and non-severe illness or between non-survivors and survivors. We will use the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale to assess the quality of included studies. We will conduct pairwise meta-analyses to compute the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using the Mantel Haenszel method with the random-effects model. The statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I statistic. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression analyses will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. RESULT(S): The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION(S): Our meta-analysis will systematically evaluate the association between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. This study will provide evidence to help determine whether cancer patients should be provided with special precautions and advised to use stronger personal protection.

0	A review on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: Preface to prevention and management approaches. The novel Coronavirus disease-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, is the most contagious disease of recent years and declared as pandemic by World Health Organization, which rapidly spreads from one person to another mainly by intimate and proximate contact. Although it belongs to same corona virus's family those caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in past decades, it has high transmission and infection rate but a low mortality rate as compared to these past diseases. National Institutes of Health has mentioned that SARS-CoV-2 can easily survive for three hours in droplets to a maximum of three days on different surfaces. Worldwide many pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are conducting clinical trials in search of vaccine and possible therapeutics for the treatment of the disease but currently personal hygiene, frequent hand wash, breaking the chain of infection by social distancing and sanitization are only solutions of COVID-19. Of course, boosting immunity with the help of home-based remedies and traditional system of medicines along with yoga and meditation is the holistic way of getting rid of the COVID-19. Present article reviews the SARS-CoV-19 structure, types, genetic characteristics, symptoms, epidemiology, world statistics, its transmission, prevention, treatment and immunity boosting for the prevention of the disease.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	High incidence and mortality of pneumothorax in critically Ill patients with COVID-19. Background: The clinical characteristics of the patients with COVID-19 complicated by pneumothorax have not been clarified. Objective(s): To determine the epidemiology and risks of pneumothorax in the critically ill patients with COVID-19. Method(s): Retrospectively collecting and analysing medical records, laboratory findings, chest X-ray and CT images of 5 patients complicated by pneumothorax. Result(s): The incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (5/49) in patients with ARDS, 24% (5/21) in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and 56% (5/9) in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, with 80% (4/5) patients died. All the 5 patients were male and aged ranging from 54 to 79 years old. Pneumothorax was most likely to occur 2 weeks after the beginning of dyspnea and associated with reduction of neuromuscular blockers, recruitment maneuver, severe cough, changes of lung structure and function. Conclusion(s): Pneumothorax is a frequent and fatal complication of critically ill patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Myocarditis is rare in COVID-19 autopsies: cardiovascular findings across 277 postmortem examinations. The COVID-19 pandemic, the result of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, is a major cause of worldwide mortality with a significant cardiovascular component. While a number of different cardiovascular histopathologies have been reported at postmortem examination, their incidence is unknown, due to limited numbers of cases in any given study. A literature review was performed identifying 277 autopsied hearts across 22 separate publications of COVID-19 positive patients. The median age of the autopsy cohort was 75 and 97.6% had one or more comorbidities. Initial review of the data indicate that myocarditis was present in 20 hearts (7.2%); however, closer examination of additional reported information revealed that most cases were likely not functionally significant and the true prevalence of myocarditis is likely much lower (<2%). At least one acute, potentially COVID-19-related cardiovascular histopathologic finding, such as macro or microvascular thrombi, inflammation, or intraluminal megakaryocytes, was reported in 47.8% of cases. Significant differences in reporting of histopathologic findings occurred between studies indicating strong biases in observations and the need for more consistency in reporting. In conclusion, across 277 cases, COVID-19-related cardiac histopathological findings, are common, while myocarditis is rare.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

Assays of specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) have been supplemented in ""diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19"" (7th edition) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China as an auxiliary evidence to diagnose COVID-19. However, the false positive results is a major problem in the application of antibody assays. The factors causing the false positive results were analyzed and the ways were discussed to reduce the false positive results. The false positive results of antibody assays can be reduced, but they cannot be fully resolved.

0	COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health of the General Public: Is there a Tsunami of Mental Disorders?. The paper reviews and discusses short-and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for population mental health. The dynamics of short-term psychological reactions-such as anxiety, depression and distress-seem to follow directly the epidemiological dynamics of the outbreak. Although older individuals are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease course and death, psychological reactions seem to be more intense in younger individuals compared to the elderly. For long-term consequences, we do not have data yet. However, since the association between economic crises and population mental health is established, a recession-related increase in mental disorders is assumed. Mental health should be key concern in the management of the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.	false
0	Effect of a strict hygiene bundle for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital: a practical approach from the field. Background: During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic it is crucial for hospitals to implement infection prevention strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission to the lowest possible number. This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. Method(s): All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. Result(s): In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees. Conclusion(s): The available data underline that a strict hygiene bundle seem to be associated with a decrease of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the pandemic situation.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	High Prevalence of Acquired Thrombophilia Without Prognosis Value in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background Recent literature reports a strong thrombotic tendency in patients hospitalized for a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID-19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID-19 infections. Methods and Results In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D-dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. Conclusions We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID-19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID-19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

0	COVID-19 in children: Pathogenesis and current status. BACKGROUND: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, thereare children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to thatseen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. RESULT(S): The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. Ithas become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder diseasebecause of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they canpresent with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.	false
0	Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19. Background: COVID-19 is an extremely severe infectious disease. However, few studies have focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19. This study conducted a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted on children with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in mainland China using the web crawler technique to collect anonymous COVID-19 updates published by local health authorities. Result(s): Three hundred forty-one children aged 4 days to 14 years with a median age of 7 years were included. Sixty-six percent of pediatric patients were infected via family members with COVID-19. The median incubation period was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 13). Asymptomatic cases accounted for 5.9%, of which 30% had abnormal chest radiologic findings. A majority of pediatric COVID-19 cases showed mild to moderate clinical features, and only a few developed severe or critical diseases (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively). Fever (77.9%) and cough (32.4%) were the predominant presenting symptoms of pediatric COVID-19. The pediatric patients had fewer underlying diseases and complications than adults. The treatment modalities for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those of adult COVID-19 patients. The overall prognosis of pediatric COVID-19 was benign with a decent recovery. The median time from onset to cure was 16 days (interquartile range, 13 to 21). Conclusion(s): Compared to adults, COVID-19 in children has distinct features of epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The findings from this study might help to guide the development of measures to prevent and treat this ongoing global pandemic.

0	Insights from Pharmaceutical Biotechnology into Phenolic Biopharmaceuticals against COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had infected more than 3.5M people around the world and more than 250K people died in 187 countries by May 2020. The causal agent of this disease is a coronavirus whose onset of symptoms to death range from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days. This period is dependent on several factors such as the presence of comorbidities, age and the efficiency of the innate or adaptive immune responses. The effectors mechanisms of both types of immune responses depend on the pathogen involved. In the case of a viral infection, the innate immune response may approach the harmful virus through pattern recognition receptors inducing an antiviral state. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response activates antibody production to neutralize or eliminate the virus. Phenolics are plant secondary metabolites with many biological activities for plants and humans against infection. Chemical modification of proteins may enhance their biological properties; thus, a protein of medical interest, for instance, a viral protein can be used as scaffold to build a biopharmaceutical conjugated or complexated with phenolics exhibiting structural complexity or biological activities to achieve effective phenolic-protein-based therapeutics like vaccine adjuvant complexes, immunogen conjugates, and antiviral conjugates. CONCLUSION(S): Pharmaceutical biotechnology applies the principles of biotechnology to develop biopharmaceuticals for protein-based therapeutics; such as adjuvants, recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals. As neither a vaccine nor a treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, this manuscript focuses on insights from pharmaceutical biotechnology into phenolic biopharmaceuticals against COVID-19.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.	false
0	Investigating the Prevalence of Reactive Online Searching in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study. BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on global society, health care, governments, and mass media. Public dissemination of government policies, medical interventions, and misinformation has been remarkably rapid and largely unregulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased misinterpretations, miscommunication, and public panic. Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to COVID-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries. METHOD(S): This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases. RESULT(S): Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these COVID-19-related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, SD 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, SD 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, SD 0.112). CONCLUSION(S): These findings illustrate the increased rate and volume of the public consumption of novel information during a global health care crisis. The positive correlation between mortality and online searching, particularly in countries with lower COVID-19 testing rates, may demonstrate the imperative to safeguard official communications and dispel misinformation in these countries. Online news, government briefings, and social media provide a powerful tool for the dissemination of important information to the public during pandemics, but their misuse and the presentation of misrepresented medical information should be monitored, minimized, and addressed to safeguard public safety. Ultimately, governments, public health authorities, and scientists have a moral imperative to safeguard the truth and maintain an accessible discourse with the public to limit fear.Copyright ©Rafael A Badell-Grau, Jordan Patrick Cuff, Brendan P Kelly, Helen Waller-Evans, Emyr Lloyd-Evans.

0	In vivo RNA-RNA recombination of coronavirus in mouse brain. RNA-RNA recombination between different strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) occurs at a very high frequency in tissue culture. To demonstrate that RNA recombination may play a role in the evolution and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, we sought to determine whether MHV recombination could occur during replication in the animal host of the virus. By using two selectable markers, i.e., temperature sensitivity and monoclonal antibody neutralization, we isolated several recombinant viruses from the brains of mice infected with two different strains of MHV. The recombination frequency was very high, and recombination occurred at multiple sites on the viral RNA genome. This finding suggests that RNA-RNA recombination may play a significant role in natural evolution and neuropathogenesis of coronaviruses.	false
0	Fatal outcome of anti-MDA5 juvenile dermatomyositis in a paediatric COVID-19 patient: a case report. Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 juvenile dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5 JDM) is associated with high risk of developing rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD). Here we report an 11-year-old girl with anti-MDA5 JDM and RP-ILD which led to a fatal outcome, further aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. She was referred to our hospital after being diagnosed with anti-MDA5 JDM and respiratory failure due to RP-ILD. On admission, fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii infection so treatment with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated. Due to RP-ILD worsening, immunosuppressive therapy was intensified using methylprednisolone pulses, cyclophosphamide, tofacitinib and intravenous immunoglobulin without response. She developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, further complicated with severe RP-ILD and cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Three real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were made with a negative result. In addition, she was complicated with a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and a fourth real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed in BAS sample was positive. Despite aggressive treatment of RP-ILD due to anti-MDA5 JDM, there was no improvement of respiratory failure in the following days and patient developed refractory septic shock and died. Anti-MDA5 JDM patients with RP-ILD have a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate. For this reason, intensive immunosuppressive therapy is essential including the use of promising drugs such as tofacitinib. COVID-19 in children with underlying health conditions like anti-MDA5 JDM may still be at risk for disease and severe complications.Copyright © 2020 Japan College of Rheumatology.	false
0	Children with acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric hospitals in autumn/winter 2020/2021: Recommendations of the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) and the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) (status 14 October 2020). Due to the shortage of pediatric hospital beds in general and due to the large annual burden of hospital admissions for common respiratory tract infections, such as influenza or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in particular, it can be expected that hospitalization of children with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections will face hospitals with an even more tense situation than usual in the winter 2020/2021. This tenuous shortage may touch various aspects but in the first place it will affect isolation and cohorting. In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control. The recommendations proposed in this statement are intended to give assistance to hospitals for the management of testing, isolation and cohorting of pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25-50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV-2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis. In case of shortfalls in admission capacities, the requirement of acute emergency care may necessitate that isolation and cohorting in the hospital will have to be performed temporarily in a less restrictive way than recommended here for standard.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	[Mathematical epidemiology and modeling of the Covid-19 pandemic: issues and diversity]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the field of mathematical epidemiology experienced an exceptional production and media coverage of its work. Even though data and knowledge on the emerging disease were patchy, a wide variety of models were developed and applied in unprecedented timeframes, with the aim of estimating the reproduction number, the starting date of the epidemic or the cumulative incidence, but also to explore different scenarios of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Their results have made a major contribution to epidemiological surveillance and informed public health policy decisions. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine design enabled by prototype pathogen preparedness. A vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Structural studies have led to the development of mutations that stabilize Betacoronavirus spike proteins in the prefusion state, improving their expression and increasing immunogenicity1. This principle has been applied to design mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Here we show that mRNA-1273 induces potent neutralizing antibody responses to both wild-type (D614) and D614G mutant2 SARS-CoV-2 as well as CD8+ T cell responses, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a phase III trial to evaluate its efficacy.Copyright © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.	false
0	Health psychology and coronavirus pandemic crisis (COVID-19): A review study. Background: In addition to physical effects, the prevalence of COVID-19 has serious psychological consequences. The aim of this study was to provide a brief overview of the psychological consequences of the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 disease, and the strategies of health psychology in dealing with this crisis. Method(s): In this review study that was done in March 2020, indexed articles on psychology and corona were used at the ProQuest, Pubmed, Scientific Information Database (SID), Ovid, Iranmedex, Science direct, Springer, google scholar, Scopus database. Finding(s): It was determined by reviewing reliable sources that psychological consequences of COVID-19 disease were different among health stuff, general population, infected patients, their families, and children, separately. Conclusion(s): From the perspective of health psychology, care strategies for different spectrums of individuals and ultimately reducing the effects of quarantine have been proposed. Furthermore, psychoneuroimmunological research evidence of the effects of stress and negative psychological consequences on immune function and greater vulnerability to coronavirus has also been discussed.Copyright © 2016 Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

0	Evidence for SARS-COV-2 infection of animal hosts. COVID-19 is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the third virus in the family Coronaviridae to cause fatal infections in humans after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	An approach to the understanding of the clinical-etiopathological aspect of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the world is facing a health and socioeconomic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this disease as a pandemic. The condition (COVID-19) is an infectious disorder triggered by a newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2. Most of the COVID-19 infected patients will experience mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover without any unique therapy. Assessment of the clinical and epidemio-logical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests the infected patients will not be contagious until the onset of severe symptoms and affects the other organs. Well-differentiated cells of apical airway epithelia communicating with ACE2 were promptly infected to SARS-CoV-2 virus. But the expression of ACE 2 in poorly differentiated epithelia facilitated SARS spike (S) protein-pseudo typed virus entry and it is replicated in polarized epithelia and espe-cially exited via the apical surface. Limiting the transmission of COVID-19 infection & its prevention can be regarded as a hierarchy of controls. In this article, we briefly discuss the most recent advances in respect to aetiology, pathogenesis and clinical progression of the disease COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, J. K.

0	Chest CT findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a comprehensive review. The objective of this review was to summarize the most pertinent CT imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A literature search retrieved eligible studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science up to June 1, 2020. A comprehensive review of publications of the Chinese Medical Association about COVID-19 was also performed. A total of 84 articles with more than 5340 participants were included and reviewed. Chest CT comprised 92.61% of abnormal CT findings overall. Compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction result, CT findings has a sensitivity of 96.14% but a low specificity of 40.48% in diagnosing COVID-19. Ground glass opacity (GGO), pure (57.31%) or mixed with consolidation (41.51%) were the most common CT features with a majority of bilateral (80.32%) and peripheral (66.21%) lung involvement. The opacity might associate with other imaging features, including air bronchogram (41.07%), vascular enlargement (54.33%), bronchial wall thickening (19.12%), crazy-paving pattern (27.55%), interlobular septal thickening (42.48%), halo sign (25.48%), reverse halo sign (12.29%), bronchiectasis (32.44%), and pulmonary fibrosis (26.22%). Other accompanying signs including pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and pericardial effusion were rare, but pleural thickening was common. The younger or early stage patients tended to have more GGOs, while extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidation was prevalent in the older or severe population. Children with COVID-19 showed significantly lower incidences of some ancillary findings than those of adults and showed a better performance on CT during follow up. Follow-up CT showed GGO lesions gradually decreased, and the consolidation lesions first increased and then remained relatively stable at 6-13 days, and then absorbed and fibrosis increased after 14 days. Chest CT imaging is an important component in the diagnosis, staging, disease progression and follow-up of patients with COVID-19.	false

0	Emerging treatment strategies for COVID-19 infection. The new type of coronavirus (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China and has led to a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5-10% present with severe and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately 2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials. Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated. The large numbers of therapeutic interventions aim to define the most efficacious regimen. The aim of this article is to describe the treatment strategies that have been used for COVID-19 patients and review all the available literature.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Updated experience of a tertiary pandemic center on 533 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection: A prospective cohort study from Turkey. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course and impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on pregnant women. METHOD(S): A prospective cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, and perinatal outcomes were prospectively evaluated. RESULT(S): Of the 533 cases, 161 (30.2%) had co-morbidities and 165 (30.9%) were asymptomatic. Cough (n=178, 33.4%) and myalgia (n=168, 31.5%) were the leading symptoms. In total, 261 patients (48.9%) received COVID-19 therapy, 509 (95.5%) had mild disease, 7 (1.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive mechanical ventilation was necessary in 2 (0.4%) patients. Maternal mortality was observed in 2 (0.4%) cases. Of the patients, 297 (55.7%) were hospitalized, 39 (7.3%) had suspicious radiologic imaging findings, 66 (12.4) had pregnancy complications (preterm delivery [n=22, 4.1%] and miscarriage [n=12, 2.2%] were the most common pregnancy complications), 131 births occurred, and the cesarean section rate was 66.4%. All neonates were negative for COVID-19. The rate of admission to the neonatal ICU was 9.9%. One specimen of breast milk was positive for the infection. CONCLUSION(S): The course of COVID-19 was mild in the majority of cases. However, increased rates of pregnancy complications and cesarean delivery were observed.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Basic Demographic Parameters Help Predict Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 During the First Wave of Infection in West Texas. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic subclinical infections to severe acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients admitted to the hospital have increased mortality rates and patients requiring intensive care have significantly increased mortality rates. Multiple factors influence these outcomes. This study used simple demographic information available on admission to evaluate possible associations between these variables and outcomes, including mortality and length of stay. Clinical outcomes in 63 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in West Texas were reviewed. Older patients, patients admitted from nursing homes, and patients admitted to medical intensive care units had increased mortality. Unadjusted analysis indicated that males had increased mortality. Adjusted analysis indicated that males spent nearly 5 days longer in the hospital than females. In summary, age, chronic illness requiring nursing home placement, and acute severe illness requiring intensive care unit admission identify patients with worse prognoses. In addition, males will likely have a longer length of hospital stay.	false

0	Detection of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in peripheral blood specimens. The latest outbreak of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 presents a significant challenge to global public health and has a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories. In some situations, such as patients in coma condition, the oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal sampling is seldom feasible, and blood sampling could be an alternative. In the current article, a comprehensive literature search has been conducted for detecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using plasma or serum samples. To date, twenty-six studies have used SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in plasma or serum (RNAaemia) to diagnose COVID-19. The pros and cons are discussed in this article. While the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens is commonly used to diagnose COVID-19, detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma or serum should not lose sight and it could be considered as an alternative diagnostic approach.	false

0	Rapid and Impressive Response to a Combined Treatment with Single-Dose Tocilizumab and NIV in a Patient with COVID-19 Pneumonia/ARDS. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 pneumonia (CARDS) represents a clinical challenge, requiring often invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Since the pathogenesis of CARDS it probably involves a direct viral attack to pulmonary and endothelium cells, and immune-mediated inflammation with dysfunctional coagulation, it was suggested to interfere with interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity by using the IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ). We reported the case of a 54-year-old 100 kg male COVID-19 patient (BMI 29) with severe respiratory insufficiency featuring dyspnea and hypoxia (SpO2 89% on room; PaO2 53 mmHg). Despite treatment with antiviral and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), after 24 h there was a progressive worsening of clinical conditions with higher fever (40 degreeC), increased dyspnea, and hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio of 150). The patient was at the limit to be sedated and intubated for IMV. He was treated with tocilizumab (8 mg/Kg i.v., single shot 800 mg) and NIV in the prone positioning. After only 96 h, the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings showed incredible improvement. There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of C-reactive protein values, and a decrease of the fever. Both the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the derived NLR ratio dropped down to 44%. Chest imaging confirmed the favorable response. This case suggested that for CARDS management efforts are needed for reducing its underlying inflammatory processes. Through a multiprofessional approach, the combination of IL-6-targeting therapies with calibrated ventilatory strategies may represent a winning strategy for improving outcomes.	false

In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began to trickle through global communi-ties, resulting in a pandemic of proportions not seen since 1918. In the US, while the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, initially affected international travelers and their close contacts, it is now ravaging many disadvantaged communities. As in past pandemics, social and economic determinants will strongly influence susceptibility to and health outcomes of COVID-19; thus, it is predictable that low-income and vulnerable US populations will be dis-proportionately affected. Certain ""hot spots"" have already demonstrated high rates of COVID-19-related mortality in minority populations, particularly those of impoverished communities, likely due to increased prevalence of comorbid conditions as a result of unequal socioeconomic factors and inadequate access to timely healthcare [1-5]. We can anticipate similar outcomes in other vulnerable populations, particularly in immigrant communities, which have similar socioeconomic status and rates of comorbidities. With over 46.7 million immigrants currently living in the US, of which 11 million are undocumented [6], a socioeconomic perspective of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic within the US immigrant community is neces-sary. Here, we will focus on the potential impact of COVID-19 on immigrant communities in the US, particularly those in Texas.Copyright © 2020 Clark et al."	false
0	Three-Tiered COVID-19 Cohorting Strategy and Implications for Memory-Care. An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) can be devastating for residents and staff. Difficulty identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and lack of vaccination or treatment options make management challenging. We created, implemented, and now present a guide to rapidly deploy point-prevalence testing and 3-tiered cohorting in an SNF to mitigate an outbreak. We outline key challenges to SNF cohorting.

0	ESMO management and treatment adapted recommendations in the COVID-19 era: Gynaecological malignancies. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and its related disease (COVID-19) has required an immediate and coordinate healthcare response to face the worldwide emergency and define strategies to maintain the continuum of care for the non-COVID-19 diseases while protecting patients and healthcare providers. The dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk especially for the more vulnerable populations. To manage patients with cancer adequately, maintaining the highest quality of care, a definition of value-based priorities is necessary to define which interventions can be safely postponed without affecting patients' outcome. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has endorsed a tiered approach across three different levels of priority (high, medium, low) incorporating information on the value-based prioritisation and clinical cogency of the interventions that can be applied for different disease sites. Patients with gynaecological cancer are at particular risk of COVID-19 complications because of their age and prevalence of comorbidities. The definition of priority level should be based on tumour stage and histology, cancer-related symptoms or complications, aim (curative vs palliative) and magnitude of benefit of the oncological intervention, patients' general condition and preferences. The decision-making process always needs to consider the disease-specific national and international guidelines and the local healthcare system and social resources, and a changing situation in relation to COVID-19 infection. These recommendations aim to provide guidance for the definition of deferrable and undeferrable interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic for ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers within the context of the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.Copyright © Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Late Bowel Iischemia and Colovaginal Fistula after Low Anterior Resection in a COVID-19 Patient. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy has been rapid, with over 230.000 infections and 33.000 deaths (May 31st, 2020). The full impact of COVID19 on surgery is still unknown, as its effects on healthcare strategy, hospital infrastructure, staff, regional economy and colorectal disease progression, may not be evident before several months. No systematic reports are available about a higher incidence of COVID19 infections in patients with cancer. However, available data indicate that older people are more vulnerable, particularly when there are underlying health conditions such as chemotherapy or active cancer. Herein, we present the case of a patient with rectal cancer treated with pull-through technique low anterior rectal resection and coloanal anastomosis with protective loop ileostomy, complicated with Sars-CoV-2 infection and late (31st post-operative day) colic ischemia with colo-vaginal fistula. Late intestinal ischemia is a rare complication and can be secondary to several traditional factors, but certainly small vessel thrombosis related to Coronavirus disease must be taken into consideration.

0	"Coronavirus disease 2019: favorable outcome in an immunosuppressed patient with multiple sclerosis. The rapid and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a viral pathogen responsible for the development of the ""coronavirus disease of 2019"" (COVID-19), has developed into an unprecedented health crisis with considerable case fatality rate. Patients with comorbidities are considered to be at higher risk for severe disease with acute respiratory failure, intensive care unit admission, and/or death. Particular vigilance has been warranted regarding the continuation of immunosuppressive treatments since viral clearing may be hampered in such cases. In contrast, it has also been hypothesized that overactive immune responses may trigger a cytokine storm associated with clinical deterioration, which has generated an interest in certain immunosuppressant drugs as potential treatment for COVID-19. We would like to present the first case report of a patient who was formally diagnosed with COVID-19 while being under disease-modifying treatment with rituximab, an anti-CD20 B cell depleting agent, for multiple sclerosis. The clinical picture was mild for which we have tried to provide an immunopathological framework.Copyright © 2020, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia."	false
0	COVID-19 Drug Treatment in China. Purpose of Review: An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (COVID-19) occurred in December 2019, and then engulfed the entire world, presenting a significant and urgent threat to global health. Many research institutes have been involved in the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. Recent Findings: At present, the strategy of new use of old drugs is mainly used to screen candidate drugs against the novel coronavirus (later termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) and inhibit excessive immune response. Related research has made great progress. Summary: In this review, we summarize the drugs used for COVID-19 treatment in China based on the emerging basic and clinical data. It is hoped that this review will be useful to provide guidance for the prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Lymphopenia in COVID-19: Therapeutic opportunities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is uncontrollably spread all over the world. The host immune responses strongly try to confront it with all the potential cells and cytokines. With chronically condition of SARS-CoV-2, natural killer cells and T cells become exhausted and decreasing their count leads to lymphopenia. Inability to eradicate the infected organ makes hyperinitiation of the immune system, which releases the excessive inflammatory cytokines to compensate the exhausted one as well as the low lymphocytes counts; it consequently leads to the cytokine storm syndrome. These mechanisms and the potential therapeutic targeting are discussed in this paper.Copyright © 2020 International Federation for Cell Biology	false
0	Management perspective of covid-19 patients from l1 till l3 level hospital: An observational study. Background: The coronavirus (CoV) specifically known as CoVs disease (COVID)-19 spread from Wuhan city of China to the whole world and created havoc worldwide. It is an RNA virus of family beta-CoVs, and it is third CoV infection after Middle East respiratory syndrome and subacute respiratory syndrome. Aim and Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the status of COVID-19 patients in the study area. Material(s) and Method(s): A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Government Medical College, Azamgarh, on the subjects either suspected or confirmed with COVID 19 tests for March 20, 2020, till the submission of this research. Oral consent was taken from all the patients. The total number of patients included in the study is 81 who were declared as COVID positive patients admitted in the isolation ward after taking throat and nasal swab followed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. Out of 81, 73 (90.12 %) were male and 8 (9.88 %) were female and the age varies from 8 years to 95 years with the mean age of 35.48 years. Out of total patients, 1 was referred due to critical illness, two were shifted to L1 hospital, and 27 were discharged in satisfactory conditions. Result(s): The majority of patients (61.00%) were asymptomatic and the patients who were having symptoms presented sore throat and cough (32.00%), fever and cough 19%, sore throat, headache and body-ache (16.00%), cough, sore throat and chest pain (12.00%), and vomiting and pain abdomen (0.06%). Radiological investigations have suggested mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in almost (10.00%), and some subjects show changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There were 2 patients who showed severe changes of ARDS (<6.00%). Conclusion(s): The present study concludes that most of the patients were not much literate, and it was a challenge to make them understand the sensitivity of infection spread. The patients who showed symptoms were lesser; maximum was presented as sore throat, cough, and fever followed by other minor symptoms.Copyright © 2020, Mr Bhawani Singh. All rights reserved.	false
0	A first-aid procedure for staff who fainted in coronavirus disease 2019 isolation ward. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), tens of thousands of medical staff and paramedical staff have been involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Heavy personal protective equipment and continuous high-intensity work have brought great challenges to the staff. Fainting incidents occur frequently in the isolation ward. The emergency treatment after fainting is directly related to the safety and health of the injured. Based on the latest domestic and international literatures and guidelines, we proposed a first-aid procedure for staff who fainted in the isolation ward, aiming to provide reference for the treatment of staff fainting in the isolation ward.Copyright © 2020 Second Military Medical University Press.

0	SARS-CoV pandemic in india (2003 to 2020) - An update. As the emergence of coronavirus continues there is a necessity to go much deeper and analyze the previous strains to track the mutations. This review gives an overview on the SARS-CoV outbreaks and pandemics in India. Articles related to SARS infection were collected from search engines like Pubmed, Google Scholar, Cochrane. Two primary Chinese databases namely CNKI and Wantang were used for biomedical research. The relevant articles were collected from the period from 2000 to 2020 to date. The lessons learned from SARS and MERS might have contributed to the institution of more efficient preventive measures in healthcare settings. It is required to understand and do the complete research on the emergence and re-emergence of coronaviruses and to understand the change in proteins and genome. In the future, any pandemic with the same genome can be predicted, tackled, and prevented. Vaccines can be prepared effectively at earlier stages of a pandemic. In conclusion, the SARS outbreak taught us many lessons, but that of the necessity of developing new antiviral therapies was not learned. The lack of progress we have detailed concerning antivirals over the past decades is equally relevant to the development of coronavirus vaccines, for essentially the same reasons. To gather with the emergence of the SARS-CoV 2, we hope that the articles in this series will help change the attitude of researchers and funding policy makers this time around.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Intracranial hemorrhage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Background: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with or develop cerebrovascular disease during the course of hospitalization. Whereas ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients has been well described, data on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and August 14, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify eligible studies. Result(s): A total of 23 studies describing ICH in 148 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-0.9), with low levels of inter-study heterogeneity observed (I2 = 33.6%, Cochran's Q = 12.05, p = 0.149). Most of the patients were elderly male patients (65.8%) with comorbidities, the most common being systemic hypertension (54%). Hemorrhage involving multiple cranial compartments was reported in 9.5% of cases. Single compartments were involved in the rest, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) being the most common variety (62.6%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) the least common (1.4%). Half of these patients were on some form of anticoagulation. Overall, the mortality rate in the COVID-19 patients with ICH was about 48.6%. Conclusion(s): Although relatively uncommon among COVID-19 patients, ICH is associated with a high mortality rate. Early identification of patients at risk of developing ICH, particularly with comorbid conditions and on anticoagulant therapy, may be important to improve outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.	false
0	First Wave of COVID-19 in French Patients with Cystic Fibrosis. Viral infections are known to lead to serious respiratory complications in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Hypothesizing that CF patients were a population at high risk for severe respiratory complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a national study to describe the clinical expression of COVID-19 in French CF patients. This prospective observational study involves all 47 French CF centers caring for approximately 7500 CF patients. Between March 1st and June 30th 2020, 31 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19: 19 had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs; 1 had negative RT-PCR but typical COVID-19 signs on a CT scan; and 11 had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Fifteen were males, median (range) age was 31 (9-60) years, and 12 patients were living with a lung transplant. The majority of the patients had CF-related diabetes (n = 19, 61.3%), and a mild lung disease (n = 19, 65%, with percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) > 70). Three (10%) patients remained asymptomatic. For the 28 (90%) patients who displayed symptoms, most common symptoms at admission were fever (n = 22, 78.6%), fatigue (n = 14, 50%), and increased cough (n = 14, 50%). Nineteen were hospitalized (including 11 out of the 12 post-lung transplant patients), seven required oxygen therapy, and four (3 post-lung transplant patients) were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Ten developed complications (including acute respiratory distress syndrome in two post-lung transplant patients), but all recovered and were discharged home without noticeable short-term sequelae. Overall, French CF patients were rarely diagnosed with COVID-19. Further research should establish whether they were not infected or remained asymptomatic upon infection. In diagnosed cases, the short-term evolution was favorable with rare acute respiratory distress syndrome and no death. Post-lung transplant patients had more severe outcomes and should be monitored more closely.	false
0	COVID-19 infection prevalence in pediatric population: Etiology, clinical presentation, and outcome. Novel COVID-19 infections caused major morbidity and mortality globally in the adult age group. Likewise, SARS-COV-2 infections in children are highly risky in the selected patient population. We performed a focused literature search of published reports from December 1, 2019, till August 20, 2020. The aim was to explore the etiology, clinical presentations, and outcome of pediatric COVID-19 patients. Viral respiratory infections are associated with high societal costs for children. In addition, children with asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infections can be a source of COVID-19 spread to parents and caregivers. The major reported risk factors for pediatric COVID-19 cases were close contact with a SARS-COV-2 positive family member, a history of travel, and/or living in endemic areas. Children with COVID-19 who required ICU care had various comorbidities, such as malignancy. As the pandemic evolved, multiple cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporarily related to covid-19 (MIS-C) were reported. A unique population is neonates born to COVID-19 affected mothers, as there is an urgent need to optimize their management and outcome during this rapidly evolving pandemic. The early identification of SARS-COV-2 infection in infants and children has important direct management effects in these children and public health implications because of the effects on disease transmission control measures.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false

0	Chest CT in COVID-19: What the Radiologist Needs to Know. Chest CT has a potential role in the diagnosis, detection of complications, and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Implementation of appropriate precautionary safety measures, chest CT protocol optimization, and a standardized reporting system based on the pulmonary findings in this disease will enhance the clinical utility of chest CT. However, chest CT examinations may lead to both false-negative and false-positive results. Furthermore, the added value of chest CT in diagnostic decision making is dependent on several dynamic variables, most notably available resources (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] tests, personal protective equipment, CT scanners, hospital and radiology personnel availability, and isolation room capacity) and the prevalence of both COVID-19 and other diseases with overlapping manifestations at chest CT. Chest CT is valuable to detect both alternative diagnoses and complications of COVID-19 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure), while its role for prognostication requires further investigation. The authors describe imaging and managing care of patients with COVID-19, with topics including (a) chest CT protocol, (b) chest CT findings of COVID-19 and its complications, (c) the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT and its role in diagnostic decision making and prognostication, and (d) reporting and communicating chest CT findings. The authors also review other specific topics, including the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the World Health Organization case definition, the value of performing RT-PCR tests, and the radiology department and personnel impact related to performing chest CT in COVID-19. ©RSNA, 2020.	false
0	Impact of sandstorm and carnival celebrations on SARS-CoV-2 spreading in Tenerife and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). OBJECTIVE: We address the hypothesis that the extraordinary sandstorm occurred on 22-24 February 2020 might have a role in the different cumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases between the islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, since it obliged to reduce significantly air traffic and forced to suspend all major carnival street events in all most locations. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cases as to 1 April 2020 according to symptoms onset, weather-related data and Carnival events in Tenerife and Gran Canaria. RESULT(S): The sandstorm occurred on February 22-24, 2020, forced air traffic to close, reducing the influx of tourists to the Canary Islands and suspending carnival events in most places, except in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Cumulated incidence as to 1 April was 132.81/100,000 in Tenerife, and 56.04/100,000 in Gran Canaria. CONCLUSION(S): The suspension of Carnival events due to the sandstorm in the Canary Islands contributed to reduce differently the SARS-CoV-2 spread in Tenerife and Gran Canaria.Copyright © 2020 SESPAS.

0	Natural Plant Products: A Less Focused Aspect for the COVID-19 Viral Outbreak. The sudden emergence of COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV) led the entire world to search for relevant solutions to fight the pandemic. Although continuous trials are being conducted to develop precise vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, a potential remedy is yet to be developed. Plants have largely contributed to the treatment of several human diseases and different phytoconstituents have been previously described to impede the replication of numerous viruses. Despite the previous positive reports of plant-based medications, no successful clinical trials of phyto-anti-COVID drugs could be conducted to date. In this article, we discuss varying perspectives on why phyto-anti-viral drug clinical trials were not successful in the case of COVID-19. The issue has been discussed in light of the usage of plant-based therapeutics in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Through this article, we aim to identify the disadvantages in this research area and suggest some measures to ensure that phytoconstituents can efficiently contribute to future random viral outbreaks. It is emphasized that if used strategically phyto-inhibitors with pre-established clinical data for other diseases can save the time required for long clinical trials. The scientific community should competently tap into phytoconstituents and take their research up to the final stage of clinical trials so that potential phyto-anti-COVID drugs can be developed.

0	Clinicoradiological course in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients who are asymptomatic at admission. Objective: The study aimed to describe the clinical and imaging course of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who are asymptomatic at admission., Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavisrus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases that were asymptomatic at admission were retrospectively enrolled. Specific clinical information, laboratory test results, chest CT imaging features and outcome data during hospital stay were collected and analyzed., Results: 137 non-consecutive asymptomatic patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the present study. On admission, patients had no symptoms but chest CT findings were present in 61/137 (44.5%). Ground glass opacity (48, 78.7%) followed by ground glass opacity with crazy-paving pattern (9, 14.7%) were the commonest type of opacities with posterior, peripheral predominance and lower zone predilection. Among the initial CT positive group of 61 patients, follow-up imaging revealed progression of pulmonary opacities in 13/61 (21.4%), complete resorption in 21/61 (34.4%), partial resolution in 22/61 (36%) and no change in 5/61 (8.2%). The patients in progression group (54 +/- 19.7 years) were older and had higher frequency of co-morbidities (46.2%) compared to the other three groups (10.4%). The patients in progression group had a significantly higher C-reactive protein, higher lactate dehydrogenase and lower lymphocyte count than the other groups (all p-values < 0.05). The duration of hospital stay was longer in the progression group (27.1 +/- 11.4 days) compared to the other three groups (16.12 +/- 5.8) (p =< 0.05)., Conclusion: Nearly half of the asymptomatic cases with confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT imaging. Asymptomatic infections can have a variable clinicoradiological course. Clinically, some recover without developing symptoms, some present few mild symptoms whereas some deteriorate. Similarly, imaging follow-up may reveal resolution (partial or complete), progression or no change., Advances in knowledge: Clinicoradiological course of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is diverse.

0	Diagnostic accuracy of initial chest radiograph compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR in patients with suspected COVID-19. Objective: The chest radiograph (CXR) is the predominant imaging investigation being used to triage patients prior to either performing a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a diagnostic CT scan, but there are limited studies that assess the diagnostic accuracy of CXRs in COVID-19.To determine the accuracy of CXR diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with PCR in patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19., Methods and materials: The CXR reports of 569 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were reviewed, blinded to the PCR result and classified into the following categories: normal, indeterminate for COVID-19, classic/probable COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pathology, and not specified. Severity reporting and reporter expertise were documented. The subset of this cohort that had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other were included for further analysis for diagnostic accuracy., Results: Classic/probable COVID-19 was reported in 29% (166/569) of the initial cohort. 67% (382/569) had PCR tests. 344 patients had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other. Compared to PCR as the reference test, initial CXR had a 61% sensitivity and 76% specificity in the diagnosis of COVID-19., Conclusion: Initial CXR is useful as a triage tool with a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 76% in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a hospital setting., Advances in knowledge: .Diagnostic accuracy does not differ significantly between specialist thoracic radiologists and general radiologists including trainees following training. There was a 40% prevalence of PCR positive disease in the cohort of patients (n = 344) having CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other.Classic/probable COVID-19 was reported in 29% of total cohort of patients presenting with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (n = 569). Initial CXR is useful as a triage tool with a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 76% in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a hospital setting. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Inactivation by Gamma Irradiation for T and B Cell Immunity. Despite accumulating preclinical data demonstrating a crucial role of cytotoxic T cell immunity during viral infections, ongoing efforts on developing COVID-19 vaccines are mostly focused on antibodies. In this commentary article, we discuss potential benefits of cytotoxic T cells in providing long-term protection against COVID-19. Further, we propose that gamma-ray irradiation, which is a previously tested inactivation method, may be utilized to prepare an experimental COVID-19 vaccine that can provide balanced immunity involving both B and T cells.	false
0	Gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: COVID-19 pandemic has created a need to identify potential predictors of severe disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19., Methods: An extensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane. Odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) were calculated for proportional and continuous outcomes using a random-effect model. For each outcome, a 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value were generated., Results: A total of 83 studies (26912 patients, mean age 43.5+/-16.4 years, 48.2% female) were included. Gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19 included the presence of diarrhea (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.10-2.03; P=0.01), elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR 4.00, 95%CI 3.02-5.28; P<0.001), and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR 2.54, 95%CI 1.91-3.37; P<0.001). Significantly higher levels of mean AST (MD 14.78 U/L, 95%CI 11.70-17.86 U/L; P<0.001), ALT (MD 11.87 U/L, 95%CI 9.23-14.52 U/L; P<0.001), and total bilirubin (MD 2.08 mmol/L, 95%CI 1.36-2.80 mmol/L; P<0.001) were observed in the severe COVID-19 group compared to non-severe COVID-19 group., Conclusion: Gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers should be assessed early to recognize severe COVID-19.

0	[Biological diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2 infection: strategies and interpretation of results]. In response to the emergence of Sars-CoV-2 responsible for a global pandemic, a large number of diagnostic tests have been developed and brought to market in a very short period of time. RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab samples is the reference method for the diagnosis and screening of Sars-CoV-2 infection, but the tests developed are highly variable in terms of sensitivity and turnaround time. Antigenic tests generally have lower sensitivity but have the advantage of simpler and faster implementation. In front of Covid-19 symptoms with negative RT-PCR results, serology can be recommended with IgM and IgG assays. Serology is also a relevant tool for epidemiological studies. However, it is important to remember that the level of anti-Sars-Cov-2 antibodies decreases over time and can therefore impact the results of sero-epidemiological studies. Despite the need to respond rapidly to an urgent diagnostic need, it remains essential to validate the methods chosen on a well-characterized panel of samples, as the performance of certain tests is sometimes unsatisfactory to ensure a reliable diagnosis.

0	Prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms in health care workers after exposure to patients with COVID-19. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) of health care workers (HCWs) who were potentially or directly exposed to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a non-core epidemic area of China., Methods: Psychological conditions were evaluated by the multiple psychological evaluation scales in HCWs at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area in China) during COVID-19 epidemic. According to the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, HCWs were divided into two groups: HCWs with high-risk (HHCW) group (who worked in wards for COVID-19 patients) and HCWs with low-risk (LHCW) group (who worked in wards for non-COVID-19 patients in the same hospital). The clinical data of psychological evaluation scales from HCWs were collected., Results: A total of 171 HCWs were recruited in this study, with 94 (55.0%) HCWs in the HHCW group, and 77 (45.0%) HCWs in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in gender, work stress, job risk, and levels of fear and anxiety, and the depression between the two groups (P < 0.05). The incidence of PTSS was 28.7% in HHCW group, while the incidence of PTSS was 13.0% in LHCW group. The PTSS between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Further logistic regression analysis displayed that the exposure to COVID-19, work stress and coping strategies were major risk factors associated with PTSS., Conclusions: This study demonstrated that HCWs in HHCW group had a higher chance of developing PTSS when compared with those in LHCW group. The HCWs who were exposed to COVID-19 patients had more stress and chronic stress-related disorders. Stress management should be provided to the first line HCWs who combat with COVID-19.

0	The wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical presentation in children. Background: Ten months after its appearance in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 25 million patients worldwide. Because children were first identified as potential spreaders of the virus, schools were closed in several countries. However, it rapidly became evident that the number of hospitalized children infected by SARS-CoV-2 was dramatically lower than that of adults. To date, only hypotheses have been raised to explain this difference, so it is of great importance to describe the presentation of this disease among children. Here, we describe a wide spectrum of COVID-19 manifestation in children in a dedicated pediatric unit in France. Method(s): Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were diagnosed on the basis of either positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or typical aspects in chest-computed tomography (CT) were included between March and May 2020 in Paris. Result(s): Twenty-three patients were included on the basis of positive RT-PCR (n = 20) and/or typical aspects in CT (n = 4). The median age was 4.9 years [0.1-17.6]. Patients were grouped by age (<2 years old: n = 14, 61%; 2-10 years old: n = 2, 9%; >10 years old: n = 7, 30%). Overweight or obesity was reported in only three patients. At presentation, the most frequent symptom in the overall cohort was fever (n = 18, 78%), followed by acute rhinitis (n = 9, 64%) and cough (n = 7, 50%) in the under 2-year-old group and cough (n = 4, 57%), fatigue, dyspnea and abdominal pain (n = 3, 43% each) in the over 10-year-old group. Five patients required ICU treatment, four of whom were aged >10 years, two presented with acute myocarditis, and two were sickle cell disease patients who presented with acute chest syndrome. Discussion and conclusion: The youngest patients seem to present milder forms of COVID-19 without the need for ICU treatment and with a shorter length of hospitalization. More severe evolutions were observed in teenagers, with, however, favorable outcomes. Given the context of closed schools and confinement, the infection of these children suggests intra-familial transmission that needs to be further assessed. This description might help to understand the intriguing differences in COVID-19 severity across age-classes.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Serological reactivity of humans to a Vibrio cholerae common antigen. Over the course of seven pandemics, Vibrio cholerae serotypes have varied. In 1992 the appearance of a new serotype, O139 Bengal, began the eighth cholera pandemic. Several new O139 antigens have been identified, yet a common V. cholerae antigen has not been described. In this study, a monoclonal antibody specific against an 18.7-kDa outer membrane antigen reacted in dotblot analysis with 292 epidemiologically diverse V. cholerae isolates including O1, non-O1, and O139 serotypes. Serum collected from volunteers experimentally challenged with V. cholerae O139, and rabbit antisera to V. cholerae O1, were reactive with the 18.7-kDa antigen by Western immunoblot. This is the first report that the 18.7-kDa antigen is present in V. cholerae O139.	false
0	A fatal course of multiple inflammatory syndrome in children coinfection with dengue. A case report from Indonesia. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a currently ongoing global pandemic. Children tend to show milder symptoms of infection compared to adults. Concurrently, in April 2020, there was reported an escalation of Kawasaki cases like disease in children treated in the intensive care unit and showing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS CoV-2 positive. Those children had a hyperinflammatory response, which caused the failure of multi-organ and shock. Several countries have reported similar cases since then. Here we describe a case of a patient with COVID-19 and concurrent dengue infection presenting MIS-C. A 6-year-old male with no past medical history looked pale with fatigue and brought to an emergency room from a referral hospital. The patient presented with fever, acute abdominal pain, shock, and deteriorate quickly, confirmed with the serology of SARS CoV-2 IgM was reactive, serology of anti-dengue IgM was reactive and PCR SARS CoV-2 was negative. Possibly it is MIS-C coinfection with severe unusual dengue infection or MIS-C with false-positive dengue serologic test leading to a fatal outcome. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	Spatial modeling could not differentiate early SARS-CoV-2 cases from the distribution of humans on the basis of climate in the United States. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet, as a novel pathogen, knowledge of its biology is still emerging. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest at least some link between SARS-CoV-2 and weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, we believe climate's relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring, as it may have some impact on the distribution of cases. To further examine if there is a link to climate, we build model projections with raw SARS-CoV-2 case data and population-scaled case data in the USA. The case data were from across March 2020, before large travel restrictions and public health policies were impacting cases across the country. We show that SDMs built from population-scaled case data cannot be distinguished from control models (built from raw human population data), while SDMs built on raw case data fail to predict the known distribution of cases in the U.S. from March. The population-scaled analyses indicate that climate did not play a central role in early U.S. viral distribution and that human population density was likely the primary driver. We do find slightly more population-scaled viral cases in cooler areas. Ultimately, the temporal and geographic constraints on this study mean that we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread anywhere in the U.S. where governmental policy does not prevent spread.

0	A physicochemical model for rationalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage. Case study: The city of Thessaloniki in Greece. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage has been employed by several researchers as an alternative early warning indicator of virus spreading in communities, covering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV254/DOC) over the dissolved oxygen (DO) as the parameter with the highest correlation with viral copies. This implies a strong effect on viral inaccessibility in sewage caused (i) by the presence of humic-like substances and (ii) by virus decay due to oxidation and metabolic activity of bacteria. The present results suggest days where many fold corrections in the measurement of viral copies should be applied. As a result, although the detected RNA load in June 2020 is similar to that in April 2020, virus shedding in the city is about 5 times lower in June than in April, in line with the very low SARS-CoV-2 incidence and hospital admissions for COVID-19 in Thessaloniki in June.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The Identification of First COVID-19 Cluster in Indonesia. We describe the first 11 detected COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, resulting from a local transmission occurring in a club and a restaurant. The virus was detected until an average of 21.3 days (range: 11-25, SD: 4.1) after the onset of illness, and the partial N gene sequences (28,321-28,707 nucleotide position) had 100% similarity with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. Two subjects were asymptomatic, and one subject has died.	false
0	"Postinfectious Onset of Myasthenia Gravis in a COVID-19 Patient. Objective: We report the case of a young woman with postinfectious onset of myasthenia gravis after COVID-19 with mild respiratory symptoms and anosmia/ageusia 1 month before admission to our neurological department. Method(s): Patient data were derived from medical records of Hannover Medical School, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. Result(s): The 21-year-old female patient presented with subacute, vertically shifted double vision evoked by right sided partial oculomotor paresis and ptosis. About 4 weeks earlier she had suffered from mild respiratory symptoms, aching limbs and head without fever, accompanied by anosmia/ageusia. During the persistence of the latter symptoms for around 10 days the patient had already noticed ""tired eyes"" and fluctuating double vision. Clinical assessment including a positive test with edrophonium chloride and increased acetylcholine receptor antibodies related the ocular manifestation etiologically to myasthenia gravis. Antibodies (IgA/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 using three different serological tests (Abbott, DiaSorin, Euroimmun) were detected in serum suggesting this specific coronavirus as previously infectious agent in our patient. The myasthenic syndrome was treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulins and oral pyridostigmine. Conclusion(s): This is the first case presentation of postinfectious myasthenia gravis as neurological complication in a COVID-19 patient.© Copyright © 2020 Huber, Rogozinski, Puppe, Framme, Hoglinger, Hufendiek and Wegner."	false
0	Worldwide threatening to mankind-SARS-CoV-2 and it's attributes. The newly emerged pandemic causes massive fatality which was originated from Huanan sea food market in Hubei province in China. It closely resembles SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It was transmitted from infected animal host to human and it was suspected that bats are carrier as its genome is 96% similar to the new pandemic. Due to the close resemblance of COVID-19 with SARS-CoV it was named as SARS-CoV-2 by ICTV under orthocoronavirinae subfamily and genus betacoronaviruses. Through the droplets and fomites from the infected persons and close contact with them causes the transmission. SARS-COV-2 contains structural proteins, M, N, E, S and sixteen non-structural proteins. It enters the cell by binding with ACE2 receptor on the cell membrane of lungs with the help of S protein by endocytosis. The host innate and adaptive immunity effectively produce antiviral response by pro inflammatory cytokines, CD4 cells and CD 8+ cells. CTLS are activated by cytotoxic T cells. Due to the increased release of cytokines leads to cytokine storm and cause inflammatory-induced lung injury. RT-PCR, CT, and Serological methods are used to diagnose the COVID-19 which helps in isolation of infected patients and control of spread of the infection. Since there is no vaccines and proper medications for SARS-CoV-2 it is more vital to prevent our own selves from infection by following preventive measures like maintaining social distancing, washing hands, and practicing personal health hygiene.Copyright © 2020 Pharmainfo Publications.

0	Rapid diagnostic tests: Pros, cons and potential use in the covid-19 management in Tunisia. Objectives: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major public health issue. In a context of limited diagnostic capacity with the reference technique (real-time RT-PCR), many manufacturers have developed rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Although very promising in theory, these tests have raised many questions. This article is a rapid review that synthesizes data regarding different types of available RDTs, their performance, their limits and their potential indications in Tunisia as proposed by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Method(s): A literature review was carried out on the websites of international organizations, governmental bodies and on INAHTA database, completed by a search of relevant scientific articles up to 1 June 2020. The synthesis of the data was submitted to a panel of experts to propose recommendations for the Tunisian context. Result(s): RDTs based on the detection of antigens and antibodies have sensitivity and specificity related issues. Few validation reports are published in the scientific literature. Pending more evidence on their performance and validity, several international organizations recommend their use only for research purposes. TDRs based on antibody detection are not appropriate for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. However, validated and specific tests could provide complementary diagnostic information to reference tests. Conclusion(s): Pending further evidence, the panel recommends the use of RDTs mainly for research purposes at the community level.Copyright © 2020, Maison du Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	Accuracy of serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: first results of a large mixed-method evaluation study. BACKGROUND: Serological immunoassays that can identify protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to adapt quarantine measures, assess vaccination responses, and evaluate donor plasma. To date, however, the utility of such immunoassays remains unclear. In a mixed-design evaluation study, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of serological immunoassays that are based on various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and assessed the neutralizing activity of antibodies in patient sera., METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively followed alongside medical staff and biobank samples from winter 2018/2019. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was developed and compared to three commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) targeting the nucleoprotein (N), the S1 domain of the spike protein (S1) and a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) based on full-length spike protein. Neutralization assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed., RESULTS: One-thousand four-hundred and seventy-seven individuals were included comprising 112 SARS-CoV-2 positives (defined as a positive real-time PCR result; prevalence 7.6%). IgG seroconversion occurred between day 0 and day 21. While the ELISAs showed sensitivities of 88.4% for RBD, 89.3% for S1, and 72.9% for N protein, the specificity was above 94% for all tests. Out of 54 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, 96.3% showed full neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 at serum dilutions >=1:16, while none of the 6 SARS-CoV-2 negative sera revealed neutralizing activity., CONCLUSIONS: ELISAs targeting RBD and S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 are promising immunoassays which shall be further evaluated in studies verifying diagnostic accuracy and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

0	SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex: A Graphene-based Multiplexed Telemedicine Platform for Rapid and Low-Cost COVID-19 Diagnosis and Monitoring. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global challenge for public health systems. Ultrasensitive and early identification of infection is critical to prevent widespread COVID-19 infection by presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, especially in the community and in-home settings. We demonstrate a multiplexed, portable, wireless electrochemical platform for ultra-rapid detection of COVID-19: the SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex. It detects viral antigen nucleocapsid protein, IgM and IgG antibodies, as well as the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein, based on our mass-producible laser-engraved graphene electrodes. We demonstrate ultrasensitive, highly selective, and rapid electrochemical detection in the physiologically relevant ranges. We successfully evaluated the applicability of our SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex platform with COVID-19 positive and negative blood and saliva samples. Based on this pilot study, our multiplexed immunosensor platform may allow for high frequency at-home testing for COVID-19 telemedicine diagnosis and monitoring. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Infection control measures for covid-19 in the labour suite and neonatal unit. Trevisanuto et al. [6] have pointed out many useful and practical points for the prevention of cross-infection, and thus, provide an important platform for individual obstetric and neonatal units to adapt their own infection control measures to accommodate their individual needs. In 2003, SARS gave Hong Kong and many Asian countries a painful but invaluable lesson [1, 2]. Since then, simulation drills of life-threatening infectious diseases (e.g., SARS and Ebola) have been regularly conducted in most tertiary medical institutions. Stock checks of personal protective equipment were periodically updated. To date (April 13, 2020), Hong Kong has 1,010 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4 deaths. Over 58% were imported cases associated with travellers and students who had already contracted the coronavirus overseas. The low incidence despite its close geographical proximity to mainland China could possibly be attributed to (1) the extremely high awareness of the population in the early phase of the outbreak (January 2020), (2) wearing of surgical face masks (> 90% population) in public areas [8], (3) frequent hand hygiene, (4) social distancing, and (5) strenuous contact tracing and quarantine measures by the health authorities in disrupting the infection chain. These actions prevented overwhelming and collapse of the medical system by the sheer reduction in the number of affected patients and allowed hospitals to operate in a manageable capacity. Unlike the Accident and Emergency and Internal Medicine departments, the number of pregnant COVID-19 mothers would not be high in comparison, and most frontline obstetricians and neonatologists were able to comply with most of these recommendations for protecting mothers, infants, and HCWs. My experience with SARS suggests that it would be the on-site experience, vigilant and meticulous clinical practice, plus frequent fine-tuning of existing infection control protocols in light of new information that would save you and your patients through this invisible but very deadly babattle. With our concerted efforts, I have much hope that COVID-19 will be eradicated from our societies very soon.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.	false
0	Exposure to COVID-19 patients increases physician trainee stress and burnout. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers. Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group-functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.Copyright © 2020 Kannampallil et al.

0	Low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility for hospital staff: Prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks?. BACKGROUND: The ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 4.7 million infections greatly challenging healthcare workers (HCW) and medical institutions worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown to significantly impact mental and physical health of HCW. Thus, implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW are urgently needed., METHODS: A low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, in March 2020. Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore, employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 h. Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded., RESULTS: Between 9th March and April 30, 2020, a total of 1510 employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing facility. One percent (n = 11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18% being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%). Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. After risk contact tracking by the hospital hygiene 6 patient-to-employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact to 55 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients., CONCLUSION: In the absence of easily accessible public SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected employees with absent or mild symptoms, thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable hospital environments. High levels of professional infection prevention training and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital hygiene network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic setting.

0	Remote health service vulnerabilities and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia has highlighted the vulnerabilities of remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in terms of the high prevalence of complex chronic disease and socio-economic factors such as limited housing availability and overcrowding. The response has also illustrated the capability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Sector, working with the government, to rapidly and effectively mitigate the threat of transmission into these vulnerable remote communities. The pandemic has exposed persistent workforce challenges faced by primary health care services in remote Australia. Specifically, remote health services have a heavy reliance on short-term or fly-in, fly-out/drive-in, drive-out staff, particularly remote area nurses. The easing of travel restrictions across the country brings the increased risk of transmission into remote areas and underscores the need to adequately plan and fund remote primary health care services and ensure the availability of an adequate, appropriately trained local workforce in all remote communities.

0	Epitope-based chimeric peptide vaccine design against S, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 pandemic: an in silico approach. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a public health emergency of international concerns declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). An immuno-informatics approach along with comparative genomics was applied to design a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M, and E proteins. The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of >=90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation of the chimeric vaccine with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased IFN-gamma and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed that the chimera is suitable for high-level expression and cloning. Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global threat, COVID-19.

0	Comparison of Efficacy of Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone in Improving PaO2/FiO2 Ratio Among COVID-19 Patients. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the reason for the global pandemic that started from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, known as coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome happened in COVID-19 not just because of uncontrolled viral replication but also because of an uncontrolled immune reaction from the host. That's why antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments have become an increasing concern for clinicians. Methods A retrospective quasi-experimental study design was used to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in the improvement of PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients. We included 60 participants for this study by using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups with 30 patients in each group. Group 1 was given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and group 1 given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days. We recorded C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before administration of both drugs and after administration of drugs for eight days. We used the paired t-test to assess the effect of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants. Results The initial mean CRP in group 1 was 110.34, which reduced to 19.45 after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP in group 2 was 108.65, which reduced to 43.82 after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. In P/F ratio improvement, the calculated significance value for dexamethasone (p=0.000) was less than the table value at 0.05 in all sections, p-value for methylprednisolone (p=0.009) was also less than the table value at 0.05, which shows that both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone were effective in improving P/F ratio. Calculated p-value for dexamethasone (p=0.000) was lower than the calculated p-value for methylprednisolone (p=0.009), which shows that dexamethasone is more effective as compare to methylprednisolone. Conclusions Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and especially dexamethasone is significantly effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients.

0	Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients with Pre-existing, Compromised Immune Systems: A Review of Case Reports. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all COVID-19 patients are naive patients as it is the first-time humans have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As with exposure to many viruses, individuals with pre-existing, compromised immune systems may be at increased risk of developing severe symptoms and/or dying because of (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To learn more about such individuals, we conducted a search and review of published reports on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing, compromised immune systems. Here we present our review of patients who possess pre-existing primary antibody deficiency (PAD) and those who are organ transplant recipients on maintenance immunosuppressants. Our review indicates different clinical outcomes for the patients with pre-existing PAD, depending on the underlying causes. For organ transplant recipients, drug-induced immune suppression alone does not appear to enhance COVID-19 mortality risk - rather, advanced age, comorbidities, and the development of secondary complications appears required.

0	Lower limb deep vein thrombosis in COVID-19 patients admitted to intermediate care respiratory units. COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events; however, the reported incidence of deep vein thrombosis varies depending, at least in part, on the severity of the disease. Aim of this prospective, multicenter, observational study was to investigate the incidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound in consecutive patients admitted to three pulmonary medicine wards designated to care for patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia, with or without respiratory failure but not requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Consecutive patients admitted between March 27 and May 6, 2020 were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18-year-old or if compression ultrasound could not be performed for any reason. Patients were assessed at admission (t0) and after 7 days (t1). Major and non-major clinically relevant bleedings were recorded. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Two were excluded due to anatomical abnormalities that prevented compression ultrasound; sixty patients were retested at (t1). All patients were started on antithrombotic prophylaxis, unless therapeutic anticoagulation was required. Deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound was observed in 2 patients (3%); one of them was later deemed to represent a previous episode. No new episodes were detected at t1. One major and 2 non-major clinically relevant bleedings were observed. In the setting of patients with COVID-related pneumonia not requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is low and our data support not screening asymptomatic patients.

0	"Air travel and COVID-19 prevention in the pandemic and peri-pandemic period: A narrative review. Air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for travellers, airlines, airports, health authorities, and governments. We reviewed multiple aspects of COVID peri-pandemic air travel, including data on traveller numbers, peri-flight prevention, and testing recommendations and in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission, photo-epidemiology of mask use, the pausing of air travel to mass gathering events, and quarantine measures and their effectiveness. Flights are reduced by 43% compared to 2019. Hygiene measures, mask use, and distancing are effective, while temperature screening has been shown to be unreliable. Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published. Some models exist and predict minimal risk but fail to consider human behavior and airline procedures variations. Despite aircraft high-efficiency filtering, there is some evidence that passengers within two rows of an index case are at higher risk. Air travel to mass gatherings should be avoided. Antigen testing is useful but impaired by time lag to results. Widespread application of solutions such as saliva-based, rapid testing or even detection with the help of ""sniffer dogs"" might be the way forward. The ""traffic light system"" for traveling, recently introduced by the Council of the European Union is a first step towards normalization of air travel. Quarantine of travellers may delay introduction or re-introduction of the virus, or may delay the peak of transmission, but the effect is small and there is limited evidence. New protocols detailing on-arrival, rapid testing and tracing are indicated to ensure that restricted movement is pragmatically implemented. Guidelines from airlines are non-transparent. Most airlines disinfect their flights and enforce wearing masks and social distancing to a certain degree. A layered approach of non-pharmaceutical interventions, screening and testing procedures, implementation and adherence to distancing, hygiene measures and mask use at airports, in-flight and throughout the entire journey together with pragmatic post-flight testing and tracing are all effective measures that can be implemented. Ongoing research and systematic review are indicated to provide evidence on the utility of preventive measures and to help answer the question ""is it safe to fly?"". Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dependant elderly residents living in long-term care facilities in Marseille, France, March-June 2020. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to report the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based screening campaigns conducted on dependent elderly residents (compared with staff members) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Marseille, France, and the follow-up of positive cases., METHODS: Data from 1691 elderly residents and 1000 members of staff were retrospectively collected through interviewing the medical teams in 24 LTCFs and using the hospitals' electronic health recording systems., RESULTS: Elderly residents were predominantly female (64.8%) with a mean age of 83.0 years. SARS-CoV-2 detection among residents (226, 13.4%) was significantly higher than among staff members (87, 8.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the 226 infected residents, 37 (16.4%) were detected on a case-by-case basis due to their COVID-19 symptoms and 189 (83.6%) were detected through mass screening. Most (77.0%) had possible COVID-19 symptoms, including respiratory symptoms and signs (44.5%) and fever (46.5%); 23.0% were asymptomatic. A total of 116 (51.4%) patients received a course of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) for >= 3 days; 47 (20.8%) died. Through multivariate analysis, the death rate was positively associated with being male (30.7% vs. 14.0%, OR = 3.95, P = 0.002), aged > 85 years (26.1% vs. 15.6%, OR = 2.43, P = 0.041) and receiving oxygen therapy (39.0% vs. 12.9%, OR = 5.16, P < 0.001) and negatively associated with being diagnosed through mass screening (16.9% vs. 40.5%, OR = 0.20, P= 0.001) and receiving HCQ-AZM treatment >= 3 days (15.5% vs. 26.4%, OR = 0.37, P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: The high proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and independent factors for mortality suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients in LTCFs may be effective in saving lives.

0	Prediction of survival odds in COVID-19 by zinc, age and selenoprotein P as composite biomarker. SARS-CoV-2 infections cause the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and challenge the immune system with ongoing inflammation. Several redox-relevant micronutrients are known to contribute to an adequate immune response, including the essential trace elements zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients are characterised by Zn deficiency and that Zn status provides prognostic information. Serum Zn was determined in serum samples (n = 171) collected consecutively from patients surviving COVID-19 (n = 29) or non-survivors (n = 6). Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study were used for comparison. Zn concentrations in patient samples were low as compared to healthy subjects (mean +/- SD; 717.4 +/- 246.2 vs 975.7 +/- 294.0 mug/L, P < 0.0001). The majority of serum samples collected at different time points from the non-survivors (25/34, i.e., 73.5%) and almost half of the samples collected from the survivors (56/137, i.e., 40.9%) were below the threshold for Zn deficiency, i.e., below 638.7 mug/L (the 2.5th percentile in the EPIC cohort). In view that the Se status biomarker and Se transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is also particularly low in COVID-19, we tested the prevalence of a combined deficit, i.e., serum Zn below 638.7 mug/L and serum SELENOP below 2.56 mg/L. This combined deficit was observed in 0.15% of samples in the EPIC cohort of healthy subjects, in 19.7% of the samples collected from the surviving COVID-19 patients and in 50.0% of samples from the non-survivors. Accordingly, the composite biomarker (SELENOP and Zn with age) proved as a reliable indicator of survival in COVID-19 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 94.42%. We conclude that Zn and SELENOP status within the reference ranges indicate high survival odds in COVID-19, and assume that correcting a diagnostically proven deficit in Se and/or Zn by a personalised supplementation may support convalescence.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Pulmonary ischaemia without pulmonary arterial thrombus in COVID-19 patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a cohort study. AIM: To evaluate the incidence of pulmonary ischaemia in COVID-19 patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and its correlation with pulmonary artery thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) thorax of all patients receiving ECMO with proven COVID-19 pneumonitis between March and May 2020 were analysed for the presence and extension of pulmonary thromboembolic disease. RESULT(S): Fifty-one patients were reviewed. The mean (range) age of 45 (26-66) years; 38/51 (74.5%) were men. All patients had severe COVID-19 pneumonitis, and 18/51 (35.3%) had macroscopic thrombosis (15 with associated ischaemia); however, 13/51 (25.5%) patients had ischaemia without associated thrombus. CONCLUSION(S): The majority of patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO had areas of ischaemia within consolidated lungs, almost half of these without subtending pulmonary artery thrombosis. Although the prognostic significance of these findings is unclear, they are highly suggestive of lung ischaemia due to isolated microvascular immune thrombosis.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Is Elective Cancer Surgery Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic?. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of elective cancer operations performed. Cancer patients are felt to be a high-risk group for COVID-19, and therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of operating during this time; however, the potential risk of cancer progression if untreated must also be considered. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the incidence of COVID-19 post-operatively in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of all types. METHOD(S): Data were collected on all patients who had an elective therapeutic cancer operation in a single large district general hospital, where standard COVID-19 precautions were in place, between 01/02/2020 and 27/4/2020, Follow-up was for a minimum of 2 weeks post-discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 during the follow-up period. RESULT(S): A total of 621 elective cancer surgeries, from a range of specialities, were performed during the study period, with 55% (n=341) being done as day cases. None of the patients were positive for COVID-19 post-operatively using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSION(S): The risk of COVID-19 following elective cancer surgery in this group of high-risk patients appears to be minimal in this study. With further precautions being introduced to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, an increase in the rate of elective cancer surgery should be a current priority for all hospitals where possible.	false
0	Multiple Sclerosis Disease-Modifying Therapy and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications on the Risk of Infection and Future Vaccination. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to linger. Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications. We propose risk mitigation strategies and practical approaches to disease-modifying therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Identification of immunodominant sites on the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus: Implication for developing SARS diagnostics and vaccines. The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is not only responsible for receptor binding and virus fusion, but also a major Ag among the SARS-CoV proteins that induces protective Ab responses. In this study, we showed that the S protein of SARS-CoV is highly immunogenic during infection and immunizations, and contains five linear immunodominant sites (sites I to V) as determined by Pepscan analysis with a set of synthetic peptides overlapping the entire S protein sequence against the convalescent sera from SARS patients and antisera from small animals immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Site IV located in the middle region of the S protein (residues 528-635) is a major immunodominant epitope. The synthetic peptide S603-634, which overlaps the site IV sequence reacted with all the convalescent sera from 42 SARS patient, but none of the 30 serum samples from healthy blood donors, suggesting its potential application as an Ag for developing SARS diagnostics. This study also provides information useful for designing SARS vaccines and understanding the SARS pathogenesis.	false
0	Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eliminating trachoma as a public health problem. Background: Progress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has been substantial, but the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted community-based control efforts., Methods: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma., Results: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of one. We find that when the basic reproduction number is below one, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is above one, significant delays can occur. In most districts a year of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease., Conclusion: If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.	false
0	Pathophysiology of COVID-19: Mechanisms Underlying Disease Severity and Progression. The global epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggests a wide spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been well characterized, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying disease severity and progression remain unclear. This review highlights key mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to COVID-19 progression from viral entry to multisystem organ failure, as well as the central role of the immune response in successful viral clearance or progression to death.	false

0	COVID-19 and Telehealth: Prevention of Exposure in a Medically Complex Patient With a Mild Presentation. The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We discuss a less common presentation of COVID-19 in a patient where the use of telemedicine technology prevented the exposure of the healthcare team in an academic general pediatrics clinic. A medically complex 20-year-old male presented via virtual visit for unilateral eye redness and discharge. He received topical ophthalmic antibiotics for presumed acute bacterial conjunctivitis and was counseled on return precautions. Three days later, the patient developed shortness of breath, fever to 102.6degreeF, and chest pain. COVID-19 testing returned positive. Conjunctivitis is a presenting symptom in 32% of COVID-19 cases. Current evidence suggests that these patients may transmit their illness at the time of presentation. Using telehealth, we avoided exposure to a COVID-19-positive patient who would not have met criteria for testing or droplet precautions. Telehealth allows providers to triage patients, identifying those who need to be seen in person, thereby minimizing exposure. Transitioning toward virtual practice, particularly during a pandemic, prepares for the possibility of healthcare workers being quarantined but still able to provide care and minimizes exposure to asymptomatic patients or those with atypical symptoms.Copyright © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine	false

0	Isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the 2020 epidemic in Medellin, Colombia. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the new coronavirus causing an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in China in December, 2019. This disease, currently named COVID-19, has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6, 2020. Here we characterize an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the pandemic recovered in April, 2020. Objective: To describe the isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the epidemic in Colombia. Materials and methods: A nasopharyngeal specimen from a COVID-19 positive patient was inoculated on different cell lines. To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on cultures we used qRT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence assay, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and next-generation sequencing. Results: We determined the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells by the appearance of the cytopathic effect three days post-infection and confirmed it by the positive results in the qRT-PCR and the immunofluorescence with convalescent serum. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy images obtained from infected cells showed the presence of structures compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a complete genome sequence obtained by next-generation sequencing allowed classifying the isolate as B.1.5 lineage. Conclusion: The evidence presented in this article confirms the first isolation of SARSCoV-2 in Colombia. In addition, it shows that this strain behaves in cell culture in a similar way to that reported in the literature for other isolates and that its genetic composition is consistent with the predominant variant in the world. Finally, points out the importance of viral isolation for the detection of neutralizing antibodies, for the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the strain and for testing compounds with antiviral potential.	false
0	Results of the COVID-19 survey. Impact on cardiovascular care in the argen-iam-st national infarction registry. Background: The pandemic declared by WHO for the SARS-CoV-2 virus prepared the Argentine health system for the care of COVID-19 cases, but in this scenario the impact on prevalent diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, is unknown. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the centers participating in the ARGEN-IAM-ST registry, to investigate the institutional organization, outpatient care, hospitalization in critical care areas and the situation of health care workers. Result(s): A total of 80 centers were surveyed; 55% were public institutions and 97% had critical care areas. Ninety-one percent of the institutions created a crisis committee due to the pandemic and 65% took measures for outpatient care due to social distancing. In 89% of the centers hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diseases declined by 57% (SD +/- 18) and in 24% of the centers health care workers became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): A high percentage of centers participating in the ARGEN-IAM-ST continuous registry created crisis committees to reorganize the delivery of health care services; almost two thirds of them took measures for outpatient follow-up and there was a significant decline in bed occupancy for patients with cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2020, Sociedad Argentina de Cardiologia.

0	Children's anxiety and factors related to the covid-19 pandemic: An exploratory study using the children's anxiety questionnaire and the numerical rating scale. The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's lives deserve attention. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety among Brazilian children and its associated factors during social distancing during COVID-19. We used a cross-sectional design with an online survey from April to May 2020 in Brazil. We included children aged 6-12 years and their guardians. The Children's Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ; scores 4-12) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; scores 0-10) were used to measure anxiety. We enrolled 157 girls and 132 boys, with a mean age of 8.84 (+/-2.05) years; 88.9% of respondents were mothers. Based on CAQ >= 9, the prevalence of anxiety was 19.4% (n = 56), and higher among children with parents with essential jobs and those who were social distancing without parents. In logistic regression, the following variables were associated with higher CAQ scores: social distancing without parents; more persons living together in home; and education level of guardians. Based on NRS > 7, the prevalence of anxiety was 21.8% (n = 63); however, no associations with NRS scores were found with the investigated variables. These findings suggest the necessity of implementing public health actions targeting these parents and their children at the population level.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Covid-19 in children: A brief overview after three months experience. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) has become a health emergency worldwide. The medical community has been concerned since the beginning of the outbreak about the potential impact of COVID-19 in children, especially in those with underlying chronic diseases. Fortunately, COVID-19 has been reported to be less severe in children than in adults. However, epidemiologic and clinical data are scarce. Children show unique features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement that may account for the low rate of infection and death in this age group. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most relevant evidence of COVID-19 in children highlighting similarities and differences with adults.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Systematic rapid living review on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19: update as of April 30th, 2020. INTRODUCTION: This paper adds to the series of systematic rapid living reviews, started in April 2020, to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after COVID-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after COVID-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of seven guidelines, one scoping review, one randomized controlled trial, four descriptive studies (qualitative), one case series, one case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSION(S): This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.	false
0	Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and COVID-19. Scientific brief. There is no evidence that the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Two clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in countries or settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis(1). There is experimental evidence from both animal and human studies that the BCG vaccine has non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown(2,3). On 11 April 2020, WHO updated its ongoing evidence review of the major scientific databases and clinical trial repositories, using English, French and Chinese search terms for COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and BCG. The review yielded three preprints (manuscripts posted online before peer-review), in which the authors compared the incidence of COVID-19 cases in countries where the BCG vaccine is used with countries where it is not used and observed that countries that routinely used the vaccine in neonates had less reported cases of COVID-19 to date. Such ecological studies are prone to significant bias from many confounders, including differences in national demographics and disease burden, testing rates for COVID-19 virus infections, and the stage of the pandemic in each country. The review also yielded two registered protocols for clinical trials, both of which aim to study the effects of BCG vaccination given to health care workers directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19(4,5). BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis(6-8). In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in countries or settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis.Copyright © Pediatr Med Rodz 2020,	false

0	The characteristics and outcomes of 681 severe cases with COVID-19 in China. Purpose: To clarify the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features of patients with severe COVID-19. Method(s): In this study, we enrolled 681 patients with confirmed cases of severe COVID-19. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. Result(s): The median age of the study participants was 65 years, 53.2% were male, and 104 (15.3%) died. Age, Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), acute myocardial injury, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CD3 T cells counts were independently associated with death, while arbidol and ribavirin were protective from death. The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission (AUC = 0.914) predicted mortality better than NLR, CRP, LDH, and acute myocardial injury. There were 312 (45.8%) patients with cardiovascular disease, of whom 23.4% died. beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB, arbidol, and ribavirin might have a beneficial effect for severe COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease. Conclusion(s): The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission was highly predictive of mortality and survival. Clinicians should adopt more aggressive strategies for patients with a high NLR (>6.66) combined with myocardial injury. beta-blockers and ACEI/ARB, as well as arbidol and ribavirin, were effective in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Determinants of survival after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Mexican outpatients and hospitalised patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association of chronic diseases and indigenous ethnicity on the poor prognosis of outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hospitalised patients in Mexico., STUDY DESIGN: The study design is an observational study of consecutive COVID-19 cases that were treated in Mexican healthcare units and hospitals between February 27 and April 27, 2020., METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection., RESULTS: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity combined with older age, male sex and indigenous ethnicity increase the risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. It is recommended that the incidence of COVID-19 is monitored in indigenous communities, and access to health services is increased nationwide. Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

0	COVID-19 risk for patients undergoing anticancer treatment at the outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Institute of Milan: the COVINT study. BACKGROUND: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cancer are regarded as a highly vulnerable population. Overall, those requiring hospital admission for treatment administration are potentially exposed to a higher risk of infection and worse outcome given the multiple in-hospital exposures and the treatment immunosuppressive effects., METHODS: COVINT is an observational study assessing COVID-19 incidence among patients receiving anticancer treatment in the outpatient clinic of the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano. All consecutive patients with non-haematological malignancies treated with intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular anticancer therapy in the outpatient clinic were enrolled. The primary endpoint is the rate of occurrence of COVID-19. Secondary endpoints included the rate of COVID-19-related deaths and treatment interruptions. The association between clinical and biological characteristics and COVID-19 occurrence is also evaluated. COVID-19 diagnosis is defined as (1) certain if confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS); (2) suspected in case of new symptoms or CT scan evidence of interstitial pneumonia with negative/not performed NPS; (3) negative in case of neither symptoms nor radiological evidence., RESULTS: In the first 2 months (16 February-10 April 2020) of observation, 1081 patients were included. Of these, 11 (1%) were confirmed and 73 (6.7%) suspected for COVID-19. No significant differences in terms of cancer and treatment type emerged between the three subgroups. Prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors was adopted in 5.3%, 2.7% and 0% of COVID-19-free, COVID-19-suspected and COVID-19-confirmed patients (p=0.003). Overall, 96 (8.9%) patients delayed treatment as a precaution for the pandemic. Among the 11 confirmed cases, 6 (55%) died of COVID-19 complications, and anticancer treatment was restarted in only one., CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic peak, accurate protective measures successfully resulted in low rates of COVID-19 diagnosis, although with high lethality. Prospective patients' surveillance will continue with NPS and serology testing to provide a more comprehensive epidemiological picture, a biological insight on the impact of cytotoxic treatments on the immune response, and to protect patients and healthcare workers.

Most of the reported experiences suggested that COVID-19 is associated with a distinct coagulation disorder resulting in fibrin thrombi within small vessels and capillaries. Data focusing on arterial thrombotic events is few. In milder COVID cases, both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke may occur. Acute ischemic stroke seems to be higher than the rate identified among patients who visited the emergency departments (ED). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential for neurotropism. We here present a case who had neurological symptoms during pandemic days and has been diagnosed with imaging-proven ischemic stroke with COVID-19. Case report: A 40-year-old female patient presented to the ED with an articulation of speech and numbness in the right arm and leg. She is not a smoker and denied any environmental exposure. Physical examination revealed fever and hypotension with a respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min. She had dysarthria, hypoesthesia, and frustrated hemiparesis on the right arm and leg. Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Mild normocytic anaemia and lymphopenia associated with a mild elevation in transaminases (AST 73 U/L, ALT 103 U/L) and in D-Dimer (1440 ng/ml) associated the clinical picture. Thoracic CT showed bilateral multifocal peripheral ground glass infiltrations (Picture-1). Conventional MRI imaging is consistent with acute ischemia of millimetre in size on the left parietal lobe (Picture-2). The patient was accepted as having COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke. She commenced on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with enoxaparin. Nasopharynx swab sample was found to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive by RT-PCR. She did not progress to the hyperinflammation phase and discharged on 10th day of admission. One month later on, outpatient visit her neurological findings resolved, no weakness was detected. Conclusion(s): For each patient with an acute stroke clinic, thoracic CT and SARS-CoV-2 PCR should be performed before transferring to stroke or neurointensive care unit. For our patient, she did not have apparent risk factors for stroke. She was nearly asymptomatic apart of the stroke-related clinic, which points to the direct effect of coronavirus on vascular endothelial cells apart of the relationship between inflammation and coagulopathic complications in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Nosocomial COVID-19: experience from a large acute NHS Trust in South-West London. Transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare settings has significant implications for patients and healthcare workers, may amplify local outbreaks, and may place additional burden on already stretched resources. Risk of missed or late diagnosis of COVID-19 was high during the UK's initial 'containment phase', because of strict criteria for testing. The risk remains due to asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission, complicated by challenges faced with laboratory testing. We present a case study of potential nosocomial transmission associated with the first case of COVID-19 at a large acute NHS Trust in South-West London, and we describe the prevailing burden of nosocomial infections.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Zhejiang: An Imperceptible Source of Infection. Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. However, the study of asymptomatic patients is still rare, and the understanding of its potential transmission risk is still insufficient. In this study, epidemiological investigations were conducted in the Zhejiang province to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19., Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 22 asymptomatic patients and 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Zhejiang Duodi Hospital from January 21 to March 16, 2020. The characteristics of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data of mild patients were compared and analyzed., Results: The median age was 28 years in asymptomatic patients and 48 years in symptomatic patients. The proportion who were female was 77.3% in asymptomatic patients and 36.3% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with coexisting diseases was 4.5% in asymptomatic patients and 38.0% in symptomatic patients (p=0.002). The proportion of patients with increased CRP was 13.6% in the asymptomatic group and 61.1% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received antiviral therapy was 45.5% in the asymptomatic group and 97.9% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received oxygen therapy was 22.7% in the asymptomatic group and 99.1% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). By March 16, 2020, all patients were discharged from the hospital, and no symptoms had appeared in the asymptomatic patients during hospitalization. The median course of infection to discharge was 21.5 days in asymptomatic patients and 22 days in symptomatic patients., Conclusions: Asymptomatic patients are also infectious; relying only on clinical symptoms, blood cell tests, and radiology examination will lead to misdiagnosis of most patients, leading to the spread of the virus. Investigation of medical history is the best strategy for screening asymptomatic patients, especially young people, women, and people without coexisting disease, who are more likely to be asymptomatic when infected. Although the prognosis is good, isolation is critical for asymptomatic patients, and it is important not to end isolation early before a nucleic acid test turns negative.

0	Prevalence, management, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in older people and those with dementia in mental health wards in London, UK: a retrospective observational study. BACKGROUND: People living in group situations or with dementia are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older people and those with multimorbidity have higher mortality if they become infected than the general population. However, no systematic study exists of COVID-19-related outcomes in older inpatients in psychiatric units, who comprise people from these high-risk groups. We aimed to describe the period prevalence, demographics, symptoms (and asymptomatic cases), management, and survival outcomes of COVID-19 in the older inpatient psychiatric population and people with young-onset dementia in five National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, from March 1 to April 30, 2020., METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we collected demographic data, mental health diagnoses, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, symptoms, management, and COVID-19-related outcome data of inpatients aged 65 years or older or with dementia who were already inpatients or admitted as inpatients to five London mental health Trusts between March 1 and April 30, 2020, and information about available COVID-19-related resources (ie, testing and personal protective equipment). Patients were determined to have COVID-19 if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or had relevant symptoms indicative of COVID-19, as determined by their treating physician. We calculated period prevalence of COVID-19 and analysed patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes., FINDINGS: Of 344 inpatients, 131 (38%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (period prevalence 38% [95% CI 33-43]). The mean age of patients who had COVID-19 was 75.3 years (SD 8.2); 68 (52%) were women and 47 (36%) from ethnic minority groups. 16 (12%) of 131 patients were asymptomatic and 121 (92%) had one or more disease-related comorbidity. 108 (82%) patients were compulsorily detained. 74 (56%) patients had dementia, of whom 13 (18%) had young-onset dementia. On average, sites received COVID-19 testing kits 4.5 days after the first clinical COVID-19 presentation. 19 (15%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died during the study period, and their deaths were determined to be COVID-19 related., INTERPRETATION: Patients in psychiatric inpatient settings who were admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection had a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with those in the community and had a higher proportion of deaths from COVID-19 than in the community. Implementation of the long-standing policy of parity of esteem for mental health and planning for future COVID-19 waves in psychiatric hospitals is urgent., FUNDING: None.

0	COVID-19 PANDEMIC EFFECT ON EARLY PREGNANCY - ARE MISCARRIAGE RATES ALTERED, IN ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN?. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic state on early, 1st trimester pregnancies, in light of a link described between war-induced stress and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study conducted in a University fertility center. Material(s) and Method(s): All 1ST trimester viability scans done since the COVID-19 shut down, March13-May 6, 2020 (Study group), and between March 1-May 17, 2019 (pre-pandemic Control), were reviewed. Early 1st trimester pregnancy outcomes (Viable pregnancy, Arrested pregnancy including biochemical pregnancy loss and miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy (EP)) were measured. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for significant confounders. Power analysis revealed that a sample size of 58 patients per group has a 90% power with a 15% difference in outcomes and alpha=5%. The study group denied symptoms of COVID-19. Result(s): 113 women were scanned in the study, and 172 in the control periods (5-11 weeks gestational age). The groups had similar demographics, gestational history, fertility diagnosis and treatment characteristics (Table). No significant differences were noted in the rate of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Viable clinical pregnancy rates were not different between the groups (76.1% vs. 80.2% in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups p= 0.41). No significant difference was seen in number of 1st trimester miscarriage (14.2% vs 12.8% p=0.76), biochemical pregnancies (3.5% vs 1.7% p=0.34), or in total miscarriage rate (22.1% vs 16.9% p=0.32), nor in EP rates (0.9% vs 2.3% p=0.36) Mean serum TSH levels were higher in the control but fell in the normal range for both groups. Use of donor sperm was higher in the control and may have favored lower miscarriage rates in that group. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic environment does not seem to affect early first-trimester miscarriage rates in asymptomatic patients. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	A NOVEL ONLINE SYSTEM LINKING AT-HOME SMARTPHONE SEMEN TESTS WITH EMBRYOLOGISTS. Objective: Infertility is a serious disease requiring timely treatment. If treatment is delayed, the condition of patients may deteriorate over time. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously affected couples in need of immediate infertility treatment. Because of stay-at-home guidance, fewer people are visiting medical facilities, and thus it may become necessary to provide online medical services, including infertility treatment. Male-factor infertility contributes to about 50% of the incidence of infertility in couples. Semen analysis is key to diagnosing reproductive potential in men. In current practice, men must visit a clinic or other medical facility for semen analysis. However, there are cases in which visiting a medical facility is problematic, as in the current pandemic. To address this issue, many devices for at-home testing of semen samples have been developed and commercialized. We have developed a service enabling infertility patients to receive medical advice by allowing them to easily share at-home smartphone semen test data with embryologists. To verify the effectiveness of this system, we evaluated the correlation between at-home smartphone semen test data analyzed by embryologists and semen test results measured by computer assisted semen analysis (CASA). Design(s): Laboratory investigation. Material(s) and Method(s): We developed an online system that allows sperm videos captured using a smartphone microscope to be uploaded and shared with embryologists. After receiving training on the online system, the embryologists viewed the videos on a large computer screen and recorded motile and static sperm counts. Because the appearance of sperm captured in videos can differ depending on the type of smartphone, the embryologists measured sperm concentration and motility by estimating the size of the sperm head and tail. A total of 45 human semen samples were analyzed using both the developed system and CASA software. Each test was evaluated for compliance with World Health Organization semen testing criteria. Result(s): Sperm concentration measured using the online system showed a very strong correlation with CASA results (P < 0.01, r = 0.89). Sperm motility analyzed by embryologists using the online system were significantly correlated with CASA results (P < 0.01, r = 0.74). Conclusion(s): Online medical care will likely become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. The system we developed is a useful service allowing infertility patients to share at-home semen test data with embryologists. Analysis of the test data by embryologists resulted in few mistakes compared with automatic machine analysis. The system enables patients to connect with doctors and receive medical treatment online. Services like this one could be become more common in the future.Copyright © 2020	false
0	New onset of ocular myasthenia gravis in a patient with COVID-19: a novel case report and literature review. The novel coronavirus outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 first began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The most striking manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 is atypical pneumonia and respiratory complications; however, various neurological manifestations are now well recognized. Currently, there have been very few case reports regarding COVID-19 in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis (MG) causes muscle weakness, especially respiratory muscles, in high-risk COVID-19 patients, which can lead to severe respiratory compromise. There are few reported cases of severe myasthenia crisis following COVID-19, likely due to the involvement of the respiratory apparatus and the use of immunosuppressive medication. We report the first case of ocular MG developing secondary to COVID-19 infection in a 65-year-old woman. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and diarrhea and was found to be positive for COVID-19 via a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab test. The electrodiagnostic test showed decremental response over more than 10% on repetitive nerve stimulation test of orbicularis oculi. She tested positive for antibodies against acetylcholine receptor. COVID-19 is known to cause the release of inflammatory cytokines, leading to immune-mediated damage. MG is an immune-mediated disorder caused by molecular mimicry and autoantibodies against the neuromuscular junction.	false
0	"[Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Update of Information and proposed care. CNGOF.]. OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 identified late 2019 in China had spread across all continents. In the majority of cases, patients have mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache, some digestive disorders) or are asymptomatic, however it can cause serious lung diseases and lead to death. On September 2020, over 28 million people have been infected with over 920,000 deaths., METHODS: In view of the evolution of the epidemic the French National College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has decided to update the recommendations previously issued. To do this, the same group of experts was called upon to carry out a review of the literature and take into account the opinions of the General Directorate of Health (DGS), the ""Haute Autorite de Sante"" (HAS) and the ""Haut Conseil de sante Publique"" (HCSP)., RESULTS: The data on consequences during pregnancy have accumulated. The symptoms in pregnant women appear to be similar to those of the general population, but an increased risk of respiratory distress exists in pregnant women especially in the third trimester. A case of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission has been clearly identified. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described., CONCLUSION: In light of the new data, we propose updated recommendations. These proposals may continue to evolve in view of the pandemic and of advances in studies in pregnant women. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."	false
0	High mortality among hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer: A multicentre observational cohort study. Introduction: Studies suggest that patients with cancer are more likely to experience severe outcomes from COVID-19. Therefore, cancer centres have undertaken efforts to care for patients with cancer in COVID-free units. Nevertheless, the frequency and relevance of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 in patients with cancer remain unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in this population and identify predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. Method(s): Patients with cancer and a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were prospectively identified using provincial registries and hospital databases between March 3rd and May 23rd, 2020 in the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia in Canada. Patient's baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type and type of anticancer treatment were collected. The exposure of interest was incidence of hospital-acquired infection defined by diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 >= 5 days after hospital admission for COVID-unrelated cause. Co-primary outcomes were death or composite outcomes of severe illness from COVID-19 such as hospitalisation, supplemental oxygen, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. Result(s): A total of 252 patients (N = 249 adult and N = 3 paediatric) with COVID-19 and cancer were identified, and the majority were residents of Quebec (N = 233). One hundred and six patients (42.1%) received active anticancer treatment in the last 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis. During a median follow-up of 25 days, 33 (13.1%) required admission to the ICU, and 71 (28.2%) died. Forty-seven (19.1%) had a diagnosis of hospital-acquired COVID-19. Median overall survival was shorter in those with hospital-acquired infection than that in a contemporary community-acquired population (27 days versus unreached, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.4, p = 0.0006. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that hospital-acquired COVID-19, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status and advanced stage of cancer were independently associated with death. Interpretation(s): Our study demonstrates a high rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19, associated with increased mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the cancer population, reinforcing the importance of treating patients with cancer in COVID-free units. We also validated that age and advanced cancer were negative predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	GESS: a database of global evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 sequences. The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global emergency since December 2019. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can uncover single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and corresponding evolution patterns. The Global Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 Sequences (GESS, https://wan-bioinfo.shinyapps.io/GESS/) is a resource to provide comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. The database allows user to browse, search and download SNVs at any individual or multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions, or within a chosen genomic region or protein, or in certain country/area of interest. GESS reveals geographical distributions of SNVs around the world and across the states of USA, while exhibiting time-dependent patterns for SNV occurrences which reflect development of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For each month, the top 100 SNVs that were firstly identified world-widely can be retrieved. GESS also explores SNVs occurring simultaneously with specific SNVs of user's interests. Furthermore, the database can be of great help to calibrate mutation rates and identify conserved genome regions. Taken together, GESS is a powerful resource and tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 migration and evolution according to featured genomic variations. It provides potential directive information for prevalence prediction, related public health policy making, and vaccine designs. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	T cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2: experience from a French transplantation and hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunosuppressed organ transplanted patients are considered at risk for severe forms of COVID-19. Moreover, exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses might be involved in severe progression of the disease. However, no data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in transplanted patients is currently available. Here, we report the first assessment of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 11 kidney transplanted patients recovered from RT-PCR-confirmed (n=5) or initially suspected (n=6) COVID-19. After reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 transplant patients were able to mount vigorous antiviral T cell and antibody responses, as efficiently as two non-therapeutically immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis. By contrast, six RT-PCR-negative patients displayed no antibody response. Among them, three showed very low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells whereas no T cell response was detected in the other three, potentially ruling out COVID-19 diagnosis. Low levels of T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 were also detected in seronegative healthy controls without known exposure to the virus. These results suggest that during COVID-19, monitoring both T cell and serological immunity might be helpful for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 but are also needed to evaluate a potential role of antiviral T cells in the development of severe forms of the disease.

0	Characterization of local SARS-CoV-2 isolates and pathogenicity in IFNAR-/- mice. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently a global pandemic with unprecedented public health, economic and social impact. The development of effective mitigation strategies, therapeutics and vaccines relies on detailed genomic and biological characterization of the regional viruses. This study was carried out to isolate SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in Anatolia, and to investigate virus propagation in frequently-used cells and experimental animals. We obtained two SARS-CoV-2 viruses from nasopharngeal swabs of confirmed cases in Vero E6 cells, visualized the virions using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy and determined size distribution of the particles. Viral cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells were initially observed at 72 h post-inoculation and reached 90% of the cells on the 5th day. The isolates displayed with similar infectivity titers, time course and infectious progeny yields. Genome sequencing revealed the viruses to be well-conserved, with less than 1% diversity compared to the prototype virus. The analysis of the viral genomes, along with the available 62 complete genomes from Anatolia, showed limited diversity (up to 0.2% on deduced amino acids) and no evidence of recombination. The most prominent sequence variation was observed on the spike protein, resulting in the substitution D614G, with a prevalence of 56.2%. The isolates produced non-fatal infection in the transgenic type I interferon knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice, with varying neutralizing antibody titers. Hyperemia, regional consolidation and subpleural air accumulation was observed on necropsy, with similar histopathological and immunohistochemistry findings in the lungs, heart, stomach, intestines, liver, spleen and kidneys. Peak viral loads were detected in the lungs, with virus RNA present in the kidneys, jejunum, liver, spleen and heart. In conclusion, we characterized two local isolates, investigated in vitro growth dynamics in Vero E6 cells and identified IFNAR-/- mice as a potential animal model for SARS-CoV-2 experiments.

0	Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation Modulates the Cellular Proarrhythmic Effects of Chloroquine and Azithromycin. The antimalarial drug, chloroquine (CQ), and antimicrobial drug, azithromycin (AZM), have received significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both drugs can alter cardiac electrophysiology and have been associated with drug-induced arrhythmias. Meanwhile, sympathetic activation is commonly observed during systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2 infection) and may influence the electrophysiological effects of CQ and AZM. Here, we investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on proarrhythmic properties of CQ and AZM using detailed in silico models of ventricular electrophysiology. Concentration-dependent alterations in ion-channel function were incorporated into the Heijman canine and O'Hara-Rudy human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. Single and combined drug effects on action-potential (AP) properties were analyzed using a population of 1,000 models accommodating inter-individual variability. Sympathetic stimulation was simulated by increasing pacing rate and experimentally validated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in ion-channel function. In the canine ventricular model at 1 Hz pacing, therapeutic doses of CQ and AZM (5 and 20 muM, respectively) individually prolonged AP duration (APD) by 33 and 13%. Their combination produced synergistic APD prolongation (+161%) with incidence of proarrhythmic early afterdepolarizations in 53.5% of models. Increasing the pacing frequency to 2 Hz shortened APD and together with 1 muM ISO counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. No afterdepolarizations occurred following increased rate and simulated application of ISO. Similarly, CQ and AZM individually prolonged APD by 43 and 29% in the human ventricular cardiomyocyte model, while their combination prolonged APD by 76% without causing early afterdepolarizations. Consistently, 1 muM ISO at 2 Hz pacing counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. Increasing the ICa,L window current produced afterdepolarizations, which were exacerbated by ISO. In both models, reduced extracellular K+ reduced the repolarization reserve and increased drug effects. In conclusion, CQ- and AZM-induced proarrhythmia is promoted by conditions with reduced repolarization reserve. Sympathetic stimulation limits drug-induced APD prolongation, suggesting the potential importance of heart rate and autonomic status monitoring in particular conditions (e.g., COVID-19).

0	Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic. The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (n = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (OR = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.

0	Impact of COVID-19-Related Lockdown on Psychosocial, Cognitive, and Functional Well-Being in Adults With Down Syndrome. People with Down Syndrome (DS) have a high prevalence of physical and psychiatric comorbidities and experience early-onset dementia. With the outbreak of CoVID-19 pandemic, strict social isolation measures have been necessary to prevent the spreading of the disease. Effects of this lockdown period on behavior, mood and cognition in people with DS have not been assessed so far. In the present clinical study, we investigated the impact of CoVID-19-related lockdown on psychosocial, cognitive and functional well-being in a sample population of 46 adults with DS. The interRAI Intellectual Disability standardized assessment instrument, which includes measures of social withdrawal, functional impairment, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, was used to perform a three time-point evaluation (two pre-lockdown and one post-lockdown) in 37 subjects of the study sample, and a two time point evaluation (one pre- and one post-lockdown) in 9 subjects. Two mixed linear regression models - one before and one after the lockdown - have been fitted for each scale in order to investigate the change in the time-dependent variation of the scores. In the pre-lockdown period, significant worsening over time (i.e., per year) was found for the Depression Rating Scale score (beta = 0.55; 95% CI 0.34; 0.76). In the post-lockdown period, a significant worsening in social withdrawal (beta = 3.05, 95% CI 0.39; 5.70), instrumental activities of daily living (beta = 1.13, 95% CI 0.08; 2.18) and depression rating (beta = 1.65, 95% CI 0.33; 2.97) scales scores was observed, as was a significant improvement in aggressive behavior (beta = -1.40, 95% CI -2.69; -0.10). Despite the undoubtful importance of the lockdown in order to reduce the spreading of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the related social isolation measures suggest an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a worsening in functional status in a sample of adults with DS. At the opposite, aggressive behavior was reduced after the lockdown period. This finding could be related to the increase of negative and depressive symptoms in the study population. Studies with longer follow-up period are needed to assess persistence of these effects.

0	"Traumatic Stress in Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of the Immediate Impact. The disease caused by respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) called COVID-19 resulted in a pandemic that has demanded extraordinary physical and mental effort from healthcare workers. This review provides an overview of studies that have explored traumatic stress in healthcare workers and associated factors between January and May 2020. The focus is on the most relevant literature investigating the prevalence of trauma- and stressor-related symptoms. Articles were selected from PubMed and PsycINFO databases using the search terms, ""healthcare workers,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""posttraumatic stress"" in different combinations and with various synonyms. Among the seven studies that fulfilled our criteria, five assessed traumatic stress response, one assessed acute stress symptoms, and one focused on vicarious traumatization. Overall, the available findings highlight the presence of trauma-related stress, with a prevalence ranging from 7.4 to 35%, particularly among women, nurses, frontline workers, and in workers who experienced physical symptoms. Future studies should clarify the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers, with particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder.

0	High interferon titer in newborn pig intestine during experimentally induced viral enteritis. We looked for the presence of interferon in the digestive tract of newborn piglets infected with a virulent strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Co-ronaviridae). High levels of type 1 interferon activity were found early in the disease in jejunal and ileal parts of the intestine as well as in the serum. Enterocytes appeared to be involved in the interferon synthesis. These findings raise the question of the role of interferon in the pathogenesis of viral enteritis.	false
0	Blood safety in SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infectious agent that rapidly spread from a single city in China to all parts of the world. Right now, the world is facing a major pandemic crisis and every infected patient can infect the other two to three persons. The non-specific symptoms at the early stages of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and also the presence of infected asymptomatic patients result in the absence of accurate estimation of infected patients. Although coronaviruses often affect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum can occur and therefore, there is a theoretical risk regarding the transmission of these viruses by transfusion. Experience with other viruses from the corona family group (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) tells us that Covid-19 might have a significant impact on blood supply. Until now, SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified as a transfusion transmissible virus and viremia has only been diagnosed in serious patients who would not be allowed for blood donation. In this review article, the safety of blood products during the Covid-19 outbreak is discussed.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).	false
0	Estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 using re-analysis of published data. INTRODUCTION: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic evolves and test strategies change, understanding the concepts of testing (gold standard and test performance measures) becomes essential. The challenge of any novel disease is that the gold standard has yet to be defined. METHOD(S): We reanalysed published data on real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 to illustrate how predictive values vary with disease prevalence, sensitivity (set to values between 30% and 95%) and specificity (set to 99% or 99.98%). We used published data on chest CT and RT-qPCR to examine the potential of latent class analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR when no single gold standard exists. RESULT(S): For the various sensitivity values, the negative predictive value of a RT-qPCR test remained above 92% until a COVID-19 prevalence of > 10%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was more variable. For a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%, the PPV was < 10% at a prevalence of 0.1%, increasing to about 90% at a prevalence of 10%. This improved to a PPV of 85% and almost 100%, respectively, when specificity increased to 99.98%. In a restricted latent class analysis, the sensitivity was 97.1% and the specificity was 99.9%, which is similar to figures from the Danish Health Authority. However, derived predictive values depended on model specification. CONCLUSION(S): A high risk of false-positives should be considered when extending the testing strategy, whereas false-negatives may occur during local outbreaks. This may have consequences for, e.g., containment strategies and research. A confirmatory test (e.g., demonstrating seroconversion or repeated RT-qPCR) may be warranted.Copyright © 2020, Danish Medical Association. All rights reserved.	false

The current pandemic COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been affecting thousands of people worldwide, promoting high numbers of deaths. With this, the world population is going through a process of changing habits, with social distance, improvement of hygiene techniques, to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and, consequently, reduce the number of hospitalized people in serious condition, as well as the mortality rate. This scenario has been promoting a continuous search for researchers, in the most varied areas, for possible methods of prevention or cure. Specifically, in the field of pharmaceutical nanotechnology, a variety of products are being developed against SARS-CoV-2. Under these circumstances, we propose here an exposition of some of the nanotechnological products (nanoscale between 1 to 1000 nm) currently designed for the detection of the virus, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, in addition to equipment for personal protection. We believe that pharmaceutical nanotechnology will be a valuable tool in the disease from the development of products that guarantee our protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.	false
0	IL-17A and TNF-alpha as potential biomarkers for acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in patients with obesity and COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic and international health emergency by the World Health Organization. Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36; 95% CI: 1.63-33.14, p = 0.021). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of death related to COVID-19 and is triggered by a cytokine storm that damages the respiratory epithelium. Interleukins that cause the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, and, in particular, IL-17A and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), also play very important roles in lung damage in ARDS. Therefore, obesity is associated with an immune state favourable to a cytokine storm. Our hypothesis is that serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-17A are more elevated in patients with obesity and COVID-19, and consequently, they have a greater probability of developing ARDS and death. The immunobiology of IL-17A and TNF-alpha opens a new fascinating field of research for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pulmonary circulation. The particular scenario of precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has supposed a global health emergency affecting millions of people, with particular severity in the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) could represent an especially vulnerable population because of the high mortality rates reported for respiratory infections. However, the number of COVID-19 cases reported among PAH and CTEPH patients is surprisingly low. Furthermore, the clinical picture that has been described in these patients is far from the severity that experts would expect. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature between patients with PAH/CTEPH and COVID-19, leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and inflammation. In this picture, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays an essential role, being directly involved in the pathophysiology of both clinical entities. Some of these common characteristics could explain the good adaptation of PAH and CTEPH patients to COVID-19, who could also have obtained a benefit from the disease's specific treatments (anticoagulant and pulmonary vasodilators), probably due to its protective effect on the endothelium. Additionally, these common features could also lead to PAH/CTEPH as a potential sequelae of COVID-19. Throughout this comprehensive review, we describe the similarities and differences between both conditions and the possible pathophysiological and therapeutic-based mechanisms leading to the low incidence and severity of COVID-19 reported in PAH/CTEPH patients to date. Nevertheless, international registries should look carefully into this population for better understanding and management.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

0	The Impact of Pre-existing Comorbidities and Therapeutic Interventions on COVID-19. Evidence from the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has clearly demonstrated that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at a much greater risk of dying from COVID-19. This is of great concern for individuals living with these conditions, and a major challenge for global healthcare systems and biomedical research. Not all comorbidities confer the same risk, however, many affect the function of the immune system, which in turn directly impacts the response to COVID-19. Furthermore, the myriad of drugs prescribed for these comorbidities can also influence the progression of COVID-19 and limit additional treatment options available for COVID-19. Here, we review immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the development of COVID-19. We explore how underlying disease etiologies and common therapies used to treat these conditions exacerbate COVID-19 progression. Moreover, we discuss the long-term challenges associated with the use of both novel and repurposed therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing comorbidities.© Copyright © 2020 Callender, Curran, Bates, Mairesse, Weigandt and Betts.	false
0	Loss of Olfactory Function-Early Indicator for Covid-19, Other Viral Infections and Neurodegenerative Disorders. The loss of the senses of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) are rather common disorders, affecting up to 20% of the adult population. Yet, this condition has not received the attention it deserves, most probably because per se such a disorder is not life threatening. However, loss of olfactory function significantly reduces the quality of life of the affected patients, leading to dislike in food and insufficient, exaggerated or unbalanced food intake, unintentional exposure to toxins such as household gas, social isolation, depression, and an overall insecurity. Not only is olfactory dysfunction rather prevalent in the healthy population, it is, in many instances, also a correlate or an early indicator of a panoply of diseases. Importantly, olfactory dysfunction is linked to the two most prominent neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Anosmia and hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) affect a majority of patients years before the onset of cognitive or motor symptoms, establishing olfactory dysfunction as early biomarker that can enable earlier diagnosis and preventative treatments. In the current health crisis caused by SARS-CoV2, anosmia and dysgeusia as early-onset symptoms in virus-positive patients may prove to be highly relevant and crucial for pre-symptomatic Covid-19 detection from a public health perspective, preceding by days the more classical respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, tightness of the chest or fever. Thus, the olfactory system seems to be at the frontline of pathologic assault, be it through pathogens or insults that can lead to or at least associate with neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to assemble current knowledge from different medical fields that all share a common denominator, olfactory/gustatory dysfunction, and to distill overarching etiologies and disease progression mechanisms.

0	Global Prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during and after Coronavirus Pandemic: A Study Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Objective: Studies conducted on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 epidemics have shown PTSD can occur during and after infectious diseases. However, more studies are needed to explore PTSD during and after COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study is to provide a protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis to report the global prevalence of PTSD during and after coronavirus pandemics among general population, health care workers, survivors, or patients with coronaviruses. Method : We include all studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD during and after coronavirus pandemics and search databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar from first of November 2002 to May 18, 2020. Two authors independently use relevant checklists to quality assessment of the included studies and extract data. We use the graphical methods and fixed or random effect models to aggregate prevalence estimates. Also, we will assess heterogeneity between the included studies using the I2 heterogeneity statistic and use subgroup and sensitivity analysis to assess the sources of heterogeneity. Discussion: We infer that PTSD is a common experience during and after infectious disease pandemics, especially COVID-19. The findings of this study can be used by health policymakers and other stakeholders and will provide a path to future studies.

0	Can human overcome viral hijack-? Comprehensive review on COVID-19 in the view of diagnosis and mitigation across countries. The novel COVID-19, a pandemic disease, is showing an alarming spread and severity throughout the world. Globally, the community transmission of this disease is affecting people in large clusters and so it is necessary to mitigate and control them in order to minimise the social and economic consequences. This review emphasize on the origin of the coronoviral epidemics, discussion on the structural and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology, pathognomonic symptoms, fatality, available rapid diagnostic methods and proposed possible treatment methods for the treatment of COVID-19. The diagnostic markers with respect to genetic material of the virus based on PCR, CRISPR & APTAMER and with respect to proteins based on Antigens were discussed which provides new arena for the development. In control of a pandemic situation the policy adoption and implementation by the governments plays a major role and the policy implementation in different countries are discussed which establishes the effectiveness of the policies framed by the governments. The effectiveness of ethnic traditional medicines of various countries such as India and China in Immunity enhancement, along with their utilisation is also discussed. This review provides an insights towards the COVID-19 which helps in continuous investigation on different dimensions which could help us to understand the mysteries behind the havoc created by this invisible creature.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pregnancy outcomes in a racially and ethnically diverse population. Background: Older age and medical comorbidities are identified risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. However, there are limited data on risk stratification, clinical and laboratory course, and optimal management of COVID-19 in pregnancy., Objective: Our study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID-19, effect of comorbidities on disease severity, laboratory trends, and pregnancy outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women., Study Design: This is a case series of pregnant and postpartum women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 3/1/2020 and 5/11/2020 within 3 hospitals of the Yale-New Haven Health delivery network. Charts were reviewed for basic sociodemographic and pre-pregnancy characteristics, COVID-19 course, laboratory values, and pregnancy outcomes., Results: Out of 1,567 tested pregnant and postpartum women between 3/1/2020 and 5/11/2020, 9% (n=141) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Hispanic women were overrepresented in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group (n=61; 43.8%). Additionally, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with higher rate of moderate and severe disease compared to non-Hispanic (18% (11/61) vs 3.8% (3/78), respectively, OR 5.5 95% CI 1.46-20.7, p=0.01). Forty-four women (31.2%) were asymptomatic, 37 (26.2%) of whom were diagnosed on universal screening upon admission for delivery. Fifty-nine percent (n=83) were diagnosed antepartum, 36% (n=51) upon presentation for childbirth and 5% (n=7) postpartum. Severe disease was diagnosed in 6 cases (4.3%) and there was one maternal death. Obese women were more likely to develop moderate and severe disease than non-obese women (16.4% (9/55) vs 3.8% (3/79), OR 4.96, 95%CI 1.28-19.25, p=0.02). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed in 22.3% (17/77) of women who delivered after 20 weeks. Higher levels of C-reactive protein during antepartum COVID-19-related admission were more common in women with worse clinical course; this association, however, did not reach statistical significance., Conclusion: COVID-19 in pregnancy may result in severe disease and death. Hispanic women were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than other ethnic groups. Obesity and Hispanic ethnicity represent risk factors for moderate and severe disease.

0	Strategies to maximize available resources with minimum cost escalation for improving radiotherapy accessibility in the post COVID-19 era : An analysis for Asia. Purpose: There is widespread accord among economists that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a severe negative impact on the global economy. Establishing new radiotherapy (RT) infrastructure may be significantly compromised in the post COVID-19 era. Alternative strategies are needed to improve the existing RT accessibility without significant cost escalation. The outcomes of these approaches on the RT availability has been examined for Asia., Methods and Materials: The details of RT infrastructures in 2020 for 51 countries in Asia were obtained from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Using the IAEA guidelines, the %RT accessibility and the additional requirements of teletherapy (TRT) units were computed for these countries. To maximize the utilization of the existing RT facilities, five options were evaluated, namely, hypofractionation RT (HFRT) alone, with/without 25% or 50% additional working hours. The impact of these strategies on the %RT access and additional TRT unit requirements to achieve 100% RT access were estimated., Results: 4617 TRT units are available in 46 countries. The mean %RT accessibility is 62.4% in 43 countries (TRT units =4491) where the information on cancer incidence was also available and these would need an additional 6474 TRT units for achieving 100% RT accessibility. By adopting HFRT alone, increasing the working hours by 25% alone, 25% with HFRT, 50% alone and 50% with HFRT; the %RT access could improve to 74.9%, 78%, 90.5%, 93.7% and 106.1% respectively. Correspondingly, the need for additional TRT units would progressively decrease to 4646, 4284, 3073, 2820 and 1958 units., Conclusion: The economic slowdown in the post Covid-19 period could severely impend establishment of new RT facilities. Thus, maximal utilization of the available RT infrastructure with minimum additional costs could be possible by adopting HFRT with or without increased working hours to improve the RT coverage.

0	Optimising the assignment of swabs and reagent for PCR testing during a viral epidemic. Early large-scale swab testing is a fundamental tool for health authorities to assess the prevalence of a virus and enact appropriate mitigation measures during an epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Development of a quantitative segmentation model to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought a global disaster. Quantitative lesions may provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia and further to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19., METHODS: 294 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from February, 24, 2020 to June, 1, 2020 from six centers. Multi-task Unet network was used to segment the whole lung and lesions from chest CT images. This deep learning method was pre-trained in 650 CT images (550 in primary dataset and 100 in test dataset) with COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia and Dice coefficients in test dataset were calculated. 50 CT scans of 50 patients (15 with comorbidity and 35 without comorbidity) were random selected to mark lesions manually. The results will be compared with the automatic segmentation model. Eight quantitative parameters were calculated based on the segmentation results to evaluate the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19., RESULTS: Quantitative segmentation model was proved to be effective and accurate with all Dice coefficients more than 0.85 and all accuracies more than 0.95. Of the 294 patients, 52 (17.7%) patients were reported having at least one comorbidity; 14 (4.8%) having more than one comorbidity. Patients with any comorbidity were older (P < 0.001), had longer incubation period (P < 0.001), were more likely to have abnormal laboratory findings (P < 0.05), and be in severity status (P < 0.001). More lesions (including larger volume of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity) were shown in patients with any comorbidity than patients without comorbidity (all P < 0.001). More lesions were found on CT images in patients with more comorbidities. The median volumes of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity in diabetes mellitus group were largest among the groups with single comorbidity that had the incidence rate of top three., CONCLUSIONS: Multi-task Unet network can make quantitative CT analysis of lesions to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19, further to provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia. More lesions (including GGO and consolidation) were found in CT images of cases with comorbidity. The more comorbidities patients have, the more lesions CT images show.	false
0	Single-center experience of patients with interstitial lung diseases during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION: Patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) can be suspected to be at risk of experiencing a rapid flare-up due to COVID-19. However, no specific data are currently available for these patients., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 401 patients with ILD and determined the proportion of patients hospitalized for proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and specific symptoms of COVID-19., RESULTS: We found that 1% of patients (n = 4) were hospitalized (1 in ICU) for COVID-19. In total, 310 of the 401 patients answered the phone call. Only 33 patients (0.08%) experienced specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSION: Our study did not demonstrate any increased occurrence of severe COVID-19 in ILD patients compared to the global population. Based on our findings, we could not make any conclusion on the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ILDs, or on the overall outcome of immunocompromised patients affected by COVID-19.

0	Motivations for social distancing and app use as complementary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic: Quantitative survey study. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is showing negative effects on human health as well as on social and economic life. It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people's motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people's concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. Method(s): This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. Result(s): Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants' motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people's social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants' age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those fo	false
