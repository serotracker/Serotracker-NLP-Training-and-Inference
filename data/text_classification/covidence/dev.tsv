0	Serological Profile of Children and Young Adults with at Least One SARS-CoV-2 Positive Cohabitant: An Observational Study. At the end of 2019, a new disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan Province in China. Children seemed to be infected less frequently than adults, and family clusters seemed to play an important role in the spread of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the serological profile of children and young adults between 4 and 16 years of age in order to assess the transmission patterns of COVID-19 between cohabitants. The subjects lived with at least one cohabitant who tested positive for the disease using a nasopharyngeal swab. To avoid contact with the disease, families were interviewed by telephone. Forty-nine children and adolescents with a mean age of 11 years were then subjected to a rapid lateral flow chromatographic test. Of them, seven (14.3%) were immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive, and four (8.2%) were immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive. In total, 16.3% of the tested sample had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: this may confirm the lower vulnerability of children to COVID-19, despite the small sample size. The time from the negativization of the cohabitant until the test day may have influenced the results, especially when this timeframe is wide.	included
0	Assessment of Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Infection Among Outpatients in Virginia. Importance: Data from seroepidemiologic surveys measuring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure in diverse communities and ascertaining risk factors associated with infection are important to guide future prevention strategies., Objective: To assess the prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection across Virginia and the risk factors associated with infection after the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in the US., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this statewide cross-sectional surveillance study, 4675 adult outpatients presenting for health care not associated with COVID-19 in Virginia between June 1 and August 14, 2020, were recruited to participate in a questionnaire and receive venipuncture to assess SARS-CoV-2 serology. Eligibility was stratified to meet age, race, and ethnicity quotas that matched regional demographic profiles., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as measured by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay., Results: Among 4675 adult outpatients (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.9] years; 3119 women [66.7%]; 3098 White [66.3%] and 4279 non-Hispanic [91.5%] individuals) presenting for non-COVID-19-associated health care across Virginia, the weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.1%) and ranged from 0% to 20% by zip code. Seroprevalence was notably higher among participants who were Hispanic (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.1%-14.3%), residing in the northern region (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%), aged 40 to 49 years (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8%-7.1%), and uninsured (5.9%; 95% CI, 1.5%-10.3%). Higher seroprevalence was associated with Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.56; 95% CI, 1.76-7.21), residence in a multifamily unit (aOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.25-5.22), and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection (aOR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.77-10.58). The sensitivity of serology results was 94% (95% CI, 70%-100%) among those who reported receiving a previous polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 infection. Among 101 participants with seropositive results, 67 individuals (66.3%) were estimated to have asymptomatic infection. These data suggested a total estimated COVID-19 burden that was 2.8-fold higher than that ascertained by PCR-positive case counts., Conclusions and Relevance: This large statewide serologic study estimated that 2.4% of adults in Virginia had exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which was 2.8-fold higher than confirmed case counts. Hispanic ethnicity, residence in a multifamily unit, and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors associated with exposure. Most infections were asymptomatic. As of August 2020, the population in Virginia remained largely immunologically naive to the virus.	included
0	The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural southwest community. Context: The true prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been difficult to determine due to limited testing, inconsistent symptom severity, and asymptomatic infections. Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population., Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community., Methods: A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing., Results: A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest. Further large-scale antibody testing is needed to determine the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the rural setting.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in school settings during the second wave in Berlin, Germany: a cross-sectional study. <h4>Background: </h4> School attendance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is intensely debated. Modelling studies suggest that school closures contribute to community transmission reduction. However, data among school-attending students and staff are scarce. In November 2020, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany. <h4>Methods:</h4> Students and school staff were examined, oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members performed self-swabs. Individual and institutional infection prevention and control measures were assessed. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected household members were re-tested after one week. Findings: 1119 participants were examined, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff, and 625 household members. Participants reported mainly cold symptoms (19.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight of 24 classes affecting each 1-2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2.7% (95%CI, 1.2-5.0%; 9/338), 1.4% (0.2-5.1%; 2/140), and 2.3% (1.3-3.8%; 14/611) among students, staff and household members, respectively, including quarantined persons. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic. Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask use in school, way to school on foot, and case-contacts outside school. IgG antibodies were detected in 2.0% (0.8-4.1%; 7/347), 1.4% (0.2-5.0%; 2/141) and 1.4% (0.6-2.7%; 8/576), respectively. For three of nine households with infection(s) detected at cross-sectional assessment, origin in school seemed possible. After one week, no school-related, secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1.1%. Interpretation: These data suggest that school attendance under preventive measures is feasible, provided their rigorous implementation. In balancing threats and benefits of open versus closed schools during the pandemic, parents and society need to consider possible spill-overs into their households. Deeper insight is needed into the infection risks due to being a schoolchild as compared to attending school. Funding: Senate of Berlin.	included
0	High prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the Xikrin of Bacaja (Kayapo) indigenous population in the brazilian Amazon. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached the Brazilian Amazon and spread among indigenous populations. In the present study, we demonstrate a high prevalence of infection among the Xikrin of Bacaja people (Kayapo). A sample of 100 individuals of both sexes (51 men and 49 women) with ages ranging from 2 to 82 years were clinically evaluated and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Among all investigated individuals, 58 were IgG-reactive (58 %) by a rapid test, and 73 (73 %) were reactive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with no difference between sexes. Oxygen saturation ranged from 82 to 99 %, with the lowest value observed in a two-year-old girl. The results show that as expected, SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly reached more than 70 % of the population, most likely because of the difficulties of maintaining social distance due to cultural characteristics. These results highlight the importance of indigenous health policies as a means of minimizing the impact of the pandemic on these communities.	included
0	Prevalence and Time Trend of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Puducherry, India, August-October 2020. We conducted 3 population-based cross-sectional surveys, at 1-month intervals, to estimate the prevalence and time-trend of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Puducherry, India. Seropositivity rate increased from 4.9% to 34.5% over 2 months and was 20-fold higher than the number of diagnosed cases of infection.	included
0	Insights from a Pan India Sero-Epidemiological survey (Phenome-India Cohort) for SARS-CoV2. <h4>Background</h4> India has been amongst the most affected nations during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, with sparse data on country-wide spread of asymptomatic infections and antibody persistence. This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV2 sero-positivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection. <h4>Methods</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi-urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecsys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS-CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained. <h4>Findings</h4> 1058 individuals (10·14%) had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. A follow-up on 346 sero-positive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of sero-positive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one-fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for sero-positivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1·79, 1·43 – 2·24, 2·81561E-06), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2·23, 1·92 – 2·59, 6·43969E-26), non-smokers (1·52, 1·16 – 1·99, 0·02) and non-vegetarianism (1·67, 1·41 – 1·99, 3·03821E-08). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for sero-positivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups -O was associated with a lower risk. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In a first-of-its-kind study from India, we report the sero-positivity in a country-wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much-sought-for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies. <h4>Funding</h4> Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR)	included
0	A Population-Based Seroprevalence Survey of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Beijing, China. BACKGOUND The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been substantially controlled in China. As the capital of China, Beijing took a series of strict containment measures during the past several months. However, the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing has not been evaluated. METHODS During April 15-18, 2020, residents in Beijing were enrolled using a multi-stage cluster random sampling technique in four districts with top COVID-19 incidence and one district without case reported. Communities and households in each district were randomly selected based on probability proportional to size. Blood samples were collected and antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were tested by two kinds of colloidal gold kits. All colloidal gold positive serums and 20 randomly selected negative serums were then tested by Micro-neutralization assay. A likelihood ratio test was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals of seroprevalence with the Clopper-Pearson exact method. RESULTS A total of 2,184 residents participated in this survey, among which 13 were tested positive by colloidal gold tests. Of those who tested positive, 8 were IgM positive, 3 were IgG positive, 1 was total antibody positive, 1 was both IgM and total antibody positive. Among the 13 seropositive samples and 20 randomly selected seronegative samples, no positive sample was detected by micro-neutralization assay. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Beijing was estimated no higher than 0.17%. CONCLUSIONS The seroprevalence of COVID-19 was low in April suggests that the comprehensive control measures to prevent and control further spread in Beijing was effective. However, the majority of the residents in Beijing were still susceptible to infection; the risk of rebound should be noted due to low population-level immunity.	included
0	The reliability of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing - a pilot study in asymptomatic health care workers in a Croatian university hospital. AIM: To evaluate three fully automated serological assays in terms of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and perform SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing among asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) at the University Hospital Center Zagreb., METHODS: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays., RESULTS: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.	included
0	Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England from April to November, 2020: results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey. BACKGROUND: Decisions about the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design., METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382., FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time., INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care.

0	Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave. BACKGROUND: We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave., METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.

0	Seroprevalence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women along the first pandemic outbreak and perinatal outcome. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the progression of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pregnant population of the south of Madrid during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondarily we aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre during weeks 10 to 19 of 2020, coinciding with the Spanish lockdown. We tested 769 serum samples obtained from routine serological testing during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy for specific IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive)., RESULTS: Seropositivity increased from 0% to 21.4% (95% CI 11.8-31.0) during the study period, of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall outcomes were favorable with a significant increased rate of preterm birth in G4 vs G1 (21.4% vs 6.7%) and cesarean/operative delivery (50% vs 26.9%). Asymptomatic and mild cases did not have differences regarding pregnancy course when compared to seronegative women. There were no documented cases of vertical or horizontal transmission., CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence in pregnant women in southern Madrid went up to 21.4% of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall perinatal results were favorable, especially in those asymptomatic.	included
0	Prospective Sero-epidemiological Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 among Health Care Workers in a German Secondary Care Hospital. Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the pulmonary disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, which has challenged health care facilities worldwide. The sustainability of health care systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study aimed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. Method(s): Between March and June 2020, we used a combination of RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCWs in a German hospital based on repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPSs) and blood samples. Result(s): In total, 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPSs and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in three participants (0.34%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. Conclusion(s): Our study determined a low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. However, it could also indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees. Our study protocol may serve as an instructive example for future pandemic containment protocols in hospitals.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	included
0	Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-specific Antibodies in German Blood Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. METHOD(S): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULT(S): Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide. CONCLUSION(S): These findings confirm the efficacy serological testing in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.	included
0	A COVID-19 Hotspot Area: Activities and Epidemiological Findings. By late March 2020, Villa Caldari, a small village of the municipality of Ortona (Abruzzo region), was registering an incidence rate of COVID-19 cases ten times greater than the overall municipality and was declared a hotspot area. Twenty-two days later, epidemiological investigation and sampling were performed, to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 circulation and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Overall, 681 nasopharyngeal swabs and 667 blood samples were collected. Only one resident of the village resulted in being positive for RNA viral shedding, while 73 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall seroprevalence was 10.9%. The difference between the seroprevalence of infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was significant (chi2 = 14.50 p-value = 0.0001). Amongst the residents positive for antibodies, fatigue and/or muscle pain, fever and anosmia were the most experienced symptoms, whose most frequent onset was observed during the first two weeks of March. Familial and habit-related clusters were highlighted. Nevertheless, the investigations showed a low SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the village at the time of the sampling, demonstrating virus transmission could be limited when strict emergency measures are followed. Given the favorable results, the emergency measures were then lifted.	included
0	COVID-19 seropositivity and asymptomatic rates in healthcare workers are associated with job function and masking. BACKGROUND: Although the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is higher for frontline healthcare workers, not all personnel have similar risks. Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment., METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay., RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive. Additionally, a large proportion of seropositive employees self-reported as asymptomatic.

0	SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in recovered COVID-19 cases and the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 cases and close contacts, Thailand, April-June 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although Thailand has been fairly effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, continued disease surveillance and information on antibody response in recovered patients and their close contacts remain necessary in the absence of approved vaccines and antivirals. Here, we examined 217 recovered COVID-19 patients to assess their viral RNA shedding and residual antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. We found that viral RNA remained detectable in 6.6% of recovered COVID-19 cases and up to 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.8%, 88.5%, and 83.4% of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Higher levels of antibodies detected were associated with severe illness patients experienced while hospitalized. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.9%) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies, suggesting probable exposure. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and antibody duration.	included

0	Non-Congruent SARS-CoV-2 Waves in England. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Examination of the chronology, location and size of waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection across England could shed light on the inter-play between the 1 st and the 2 nd Waves. From mid-October onwards such an analysis becomes increasingly difficult due to the emergence of a new strain (VOC-202012/01) and in light of the differential implementation of lockdown measures and tiers. Therefore, we sought to examine trends and correlations in virus prevalence and covid-related deaths spanning the start of the UK pandemic in March 2020 through to early November 2020 – i.e., including the first growth period of the 2 nd Wave. We found striking regional relationships between the 1 st and the 2 nd Wave that are difficult to explain other than by involving some role for changing levels of immunity in the population affecting the progression of the pandemic.	included
0	Serological Evaluation of Patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 in Daegu, South Korea. Background: Early and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to prevent spread of the infection. Understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient, particularly in relation to those whose responses persist for more than 1 month after the onset of symptoms. We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to identify factors affecting the serological response and to evaluate its diagnostic utility in patients with COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We collected 1,048 residual serum samples from 396 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The samples had been used for routine admission tests in six healthcare institutions in Daegu. Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed and the cutoff index (COI) was calculated for quantitative analysis. The patients&rsquo; information was reviewed to evaluate the relationship between antibody positivity and clinical characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate was 85% and the average COI was 24&middot;3. The positivity rate and COI increased with time elapsed since symptom onset. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks after symptom onset at a high COI. There was a significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between patients with and without symptoms, but not according to sex or disease course. The descending COI pattern at weeks 1 to 5 after symptom onset was significantly more frequent in patients who died than in those who recovered. There was a correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity and the cycle threshold value of RdRP by real-time RT-PCR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks at a high COI in patients with COVID-19. A decreasing COI pattern up to fifth week may be associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As new treatments and vaccines are introduced, it is important to monitor continuously the usefulness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: Research Program funded by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020ER551000).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Medicity Daegu Joint (approval no.

0	Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in Monterey County, California. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Importance</h4> Essential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. <h4>Objective</h4> To identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California. <h4>Design</h4> This cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020. <h4>Setting</h4> Farmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study. <h4>Participants</h4> Individuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, ≥18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish. <h4>Exposures</h4> Sociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics. <h4>Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)</h4> Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Results</h4> Most farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection. <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> Our findings suggest both residential and workplace exposures are contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. Urgent distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is warranted given this population’s increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their work.	included
0	Dynamics of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers at a COVID-19 referral hospital in Milan, Italy. OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this single-centre prospective study was to evaluate the trend of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCWs working at the primary referral centre for infectious diseases and bioemergencies (eg, COVID-19) in Northern Italy and investigate the factors associated with seroconversion., METHODS: Six hundred and seventy-nine HCW volunteers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies three times between 4 March and 27 May 2020 and completed a questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and personal protective equipment (PPE) training and confidence at each time., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 3/679 to 26/608 (adjusted prevalence: 0.5%, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.7% and 5.4%, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.9, respectively) between the first two time points and then stabilised, in line with the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic in Milan. From the first time point, 61.6% of the HCWs had received training in the use of PPE and 17 (61.5%) of those who proved to be seropositive reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Contacts with ill relatives or friends and self-reported symptoms were independently associated with an increased likelihood of seroconversion (p<0.0001 for both), whereas there was no significant association with professional exposure., CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the HCWs at our COVID-19 referral hospital was low at the time of the peak of the epidemic. The seroconversions were mainly attributable to extrahospital contacts, probably because the hospital readily adopted effective infection control measures. The relatively high number of asymptomatic seropositive HCWs highlights the need to promptly identify and isolate potentially infectious HCWs. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	Seroepidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in 41 municipalities in Honduras wth no reports of active cases, COVID-19, June 16-23, 2020. Introduction: In Honduras on March 12, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 was reported. From that moment on, a series of measures were adopted to slow down contact throughout the country. By June 2020, cases are reported across the whole country. With the objective of identifying the presence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2, characterizing and identifying suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 in the population, the present study was carried out. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out, using a quantitative and qualitative approach, using the LQAS sampling method. The study population was the inhabitants of the identified municipalities, with no current circulation data for SARS-CoV-2 or the municipalities whose last confirmed case was 21 days ago. The data was collected through an electronic survey, it was possible to apply rapid antibody detection tests (IgG and IgM). Results: 792 people from 41 municipalities of the country were surveyed and tested. Positivity of contact was found in 6.2% (49/792). Of these, 55.1% (27/49) are men. 61.2% (30/49) are between 20 and 49 years old.The clinical symptoms found were fever, decreased appetite, respiratory distress, and loss of taste and smell, the 49.2% (32/49) without symptoms. Conclusions: virus circulation was demonstrated in the population of municipalities in which no cases were officially reported and after 96 days of the first confirmed case in the country. Detection of virus -specific antibodies could be important in surveys for asymptomatic infection in areas where contact is expected.	included
0	Longitudinal Assessment of Symptoms and Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Workers Across 5 Hospitals to Understand Ethnic Differences in Infection Risk. Objective: To understand ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and symptoms in hospital healthcare workers (HCW).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: A&amp;nbsp; Prospective longitudinal observational cohort study. 1364 HCW at five UK hospitals were studied with up to 16 weeks of symptom questionnaires and antibody testing (to both nucleocapsid and spike protein) during the first UK wave in five NHS hospitals. The main outcome measures were SARS-CoV-2 infection (seropositivity at any time-point) and symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&amp;nbsp; 272 of 1364 HCW (mean age 40.7 years, 72% female, 74% white, &ge;6 samples per participant) seroconverted, reporting predominantly mild or no symptoms. Seropositivity was lower in ITU workers (OR=0.43 95%CI 0.24, 0.76; p=0.0033). Seropositivity was higher in black (compared to white) participants, independent of age, sex, role and index of multiple deprivation (OR=2.61 95%CI 1.47-4.62 p=0.0009). No association was seen with other ethnic groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions: In the UK first wave, black ethnicity (but not other ethnicities) more than doubled HCW infection risk, independent of age, sex, measured socio-economic factors and role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trial Registration: NCT04318314&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: Funding for the PANTHER study was from the UKRI/MRC (Cov-0331 - MR/V027883/1 ), with additional institutional support from the Nottingham NIHR BRC.

0	Citywide serosurveillance of the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in San Francisco. Serosurveillance provides a unique opportunity to quantify the proportion of the population that has been exposed to pathogens. Here, we developed and piloted Serosurveillance for Continuous, ActionabLe Epidemiologic Intelligence of Transmission (SCALE-IT), a platform through which we systematically tested remnant samples from routine blood draws in two major hospital networks in San Francisco for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the early months of the pandemic. Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic medical record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has strong potential for application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among health care workers in a New York City hospital: A cross-sectional analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

0	Detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals of the national center during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020). Objective. To identify IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals of the National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology during the quarantine from April to June 2020. Materials and methods. The study included 1589 healthcare workers: 1293 professionals of 'green zone' and 926 medical staff of 'red zone'. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum were determined using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-ELISA kits (National Hematology Research Center, Russia). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the kit PROBA-NK (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). The virus was identified by RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV Multiplex REAL-TIME PCR Detection Kit (DNA-technology, LLC, Russia). Results. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 141 healthcare workers (8.9%), controversial results were revealed in 2 professionals, and 1445 (90.9%) workers had no antibodies, including 46 (3.2%) people who had the clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral disease (ARVI) and identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among healthcare workers with antibodies, the clinical symptoms of ARVI were revealed in 129 (91.5%) workers, they were also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 23 (17.8%) people had clinical symptoms of ARVI but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not extracted; 12 (8,5%) workers had neither clinical symptoms of ARVI nor detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusion. The presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker had this disease; the presence of IgG antibodies and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as clinical symptoms of the disease may be suggestive of the fact that the worker has this disease.Copyright © A group of authors, 2020.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Serially Tested Emergency Medical Services Workers. Emerging research has examined the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in numerous settings, but a critical gap in knowledge is an understanding of the rate of infection among first responders. We conducted a prospective serial serologic survey by recruiting public first responders from Cleveland area emergency medical services agencies and fire departments. Volunteers submitted a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and serum samples to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 on two visits scheduled approximately 3 weeks apart. 296 respondents completed a first visit and 260 completed the second. While 71% of respondents reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only 5.4% (95% CI 3.1-8.6) had positive serologic testing. No subjects had a positive PCR. On the first visit, eight (50%) of the test-positive subjects had no symptoms and only one (6.2%) sought healthcare or missed school or work. None of the subjects that tested negative on the first visit were positive on their second. While our results show a relatively low rate of test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 amongst first responders, most were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The potential risk of asymptomatic transmission both between first responders and from first responders to vulnerable patients requires more study.	included
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibodies at Delivery in Women, Partners, and Newborns. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in parturient women, their partners, and their newborns and the association of such antibodies with obstetric and neonatal outcomes., METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available., RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies., CONCLUSION: We found no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric or neonatal complications. Sixty-seven percent of newborns delivered by mothers with antibodies had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A limitation of our study is that we lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful differences between those with and without evidence of infection.	included
0	Susceptibility to Sars-COV-2 Infection Among Children And Adults: A Seroprevalence Study of Family Households in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, Spain. BACKGROUND: Susceptibility of children and adults to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and persistence of antibody response to the virus after infection resolution remain poorly understood, despite their significant public health implications., METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study with prospective recruitment of volunteer families that included at least one first-reported adult case positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and at least one child aged less than 15 years living in the same household under strict home confinement was conducted in the Health Region of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the pandemic period April 28-June 3, 2020. All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood., RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms., CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.

0	Prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Background: The European SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicentre in Italy, particularly in the area of Bergamo. In spite of a significant mortality rate, in the majority of cases the spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic infection. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among actively treated cancer patients during pandemic. Method(s): From April 1st, 2020 to the end of the month, 560 consecutive and unselected patients, scheduled for anticancer treatment at our facility and without clinical suspicious of COVID-19, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including a rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and a pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay in case of IgM seropositivity. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of type of cancer, stage and treatment. All IgM-seropositives were then tested with RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs and 55/146 (38%) proved to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with slightly difference b/w mildly symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (38 vs. 17). Therefore, the two-step procedure allowed the identification of 55 (10%) silent carriers in the whole study population and magnified the number needed to test (NNT) with the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay to detect a silent virus carrier (NNT: 2.6 vs. 10, with or without serological selection). At a very early follow up (8 wks), in 114 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients, who continued their anticancer therapies, none but one developed a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics strategy with serology followed by pharyngeal swab for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible and effective and can help selecting cancer patients on treatment who might be silent carriers of the virus. The early safety outcome of patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 supports the recommendation to continue active treatment, at least in the case of negative RT-PCR test.

0	Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study. Objective: Currently, little is known about the progression of an immune response against SARSCoV- 2 upon infection or sub-infection-exposure over time. We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. Methods: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. Results: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. Conclusions: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.	included
0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Children and Adults with Type 1 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE As diabetes is a risk factor for severe symptoms, hospitalization, and death with COVID-19 disease, we aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children and adults people with and without type 1 diabetes in Colorado during 2020. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We developed a highly sensitive and specific test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and measured the antibodies in people children and adults with new-onset (n=129) and established type 1 diabetes (n=94) seen for routine diabetes care at our Center between January and October, 2020. The antibodies were also measured in 562 children and 102 adults from the general population of Colorado. RESULTS The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in persons with new-onset type 1 diabetes (0.8%; 95% CI 0.1-4.2%) or those with established disease (4.3%; 1.7-10.4%) did not differ from that in the general population children (2.8%; 1.8-4.6%) or adults (3.9%; 1.5-9.7%). In a subset of individuals with positive antibodies (n=31), antibodies remained positive for up to 9 months, although the levels decreased starting 3 months after the infection (p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS From January to October 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different in persons children and adults with and without type 1 diabetes in Colorado. We found no evidence for increased prevalence of COVID-19 infections among youth with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.	included
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infections in Critical Care Staff: Beware the Risks Beyond the Bedside. OBJECTIVES: Critical care workers were considered to be at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection from patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom., SUBJECTS: Staff working in critical care., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients. However, staff also need to maintain protective measures away from the bedside.

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Multiple Sclerosis: The Hidden Part of the Iceberg. BACKGROUND: We compared the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM in multiple sclerosis (MS), low-risk, and high-risk populations and explored possible clinical correlates., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited MS patients, low-risk (university staff from non-clinical departments), and high-risk individuals (healthcare staff from COVID-19 wards) from 11 May to 15 June 2020. We used lateral flow immunoassay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. We used t-test, Fisher's exact test, chi square test, or McNemar's test, as appropriate, to evaluate between-group differences., RESULTS: We recruited 310 MS patients (42.3 +/- 12.4 years; females 67.1%), 862 low-risk individuals (42.9 +/- 13.3 years; females 47.8%), and 235 high-risk individuals (39.4 +/- 10.9 years; females 54.5%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM in MS patients (n = 9, 2.9%) was significantly lower than in the high-risk population (n = 25, 10.6%) (p < 0.001), and similar to the low-risk population (n = 11, 1.3%) (p = 0.057); these results were also confirmed after random matching by age and sex (1:1:1). No significant differences were found in demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory features. Among MS patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (n = 9), only two patients retrospectively reported mild and short-lasting COVID-19 symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: MS patients have similar risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the general population, and can be asymptomatic from COVID-19, also if using treatments with systemic immunosuppression.	included
0	Time-dependent changes in the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic liver disease outpatients in an area in Japan undergoing a second wave of COVID-19. AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious public health concern, with unclarified prevalence in Japan. Concomitant liver disease could increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19., METHODS: We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics)., RESULTS: Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0-1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Analysis of 300 cases from May 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0% (0/300; 95% CI, 0-1.0%)., CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has high specificity. The cumulative seroprevalence of COVID-19 by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay in outpatients with liver disease in Sapporo, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, was 0.17% (1/600; 95% CI, 0.0-0.9%) until May 2020.

0	"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in the cleaning and oncological staff of a municipal clinic. Aim: To prevent shedding of the novel COVID-19 virus in hospitals, strict hygiene measures and surveillance of the staff and patients is mandatory. Studying the available literature, we assumed that monitoring of the cleaning staff may sometimes be a ""blind spot"" in surveillance. Although the cleaning personnel is not entrusted with the medical and nursing care of patients, the extent of patient contacts in this group may be comparable to medical personnel and even increase in times of a visit ban in many hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections already undergone in this group. Methods: Antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured in the cleaning staff from June 15th to 30th, 2020 in our clinic. Antibodies against COVID-19 were determined using ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). For purposes of comparison, the same procedure was performed in the staff of the oncology ward, who were regarded as an important group due to their high-risk patients. Results: During the study period, 45 members of the cleaning staff and 20 members of the oncology ward were tested. Significantly elevated IgA antibody titers were detected in 1 person in the first group and in 1 person in the second group. Significantly elevated IgG antibody titers were not detected in the first group and in 1 person of the second group. In case of positive or indeterminate testing, swabs for direct virus detection were taken, but were negative in all cases. Conclusion:  The prevalence of already undergone infections in both groups is low, as to be expected due to the still low incidence of COVID-19 infections in the German federal state of Thuringia. However, the presence of such antibodies in the cleaning personnel demonstrates the need for equally strict surveillance in this group. Copyright © 2020 Epstude et al."	included
0	Novel coronavirus epidemic in the Hungarian population, a cross-sectional nationwide survey to support the exit policy in Hungary. After months of restrictive containment efforts to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, European countries are planning to reopen. To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy. NCT04370067, 30.04.2020.	included
0	Covid-19 exposure risk for family members of healthcare workers: an observational study. BACKGROUND: Many papers considered the exposure risk to COVID-19 of general population and healthcare workers (HW). However, no available papers discussed the risk of exposure of family members (FM) of HWs., AIMS: The present study collected the data of SARS-COV-2 positive FM of HWs using serological rapid IgM/IgG tests (SRT) compared with positive HWs at SRT and serological quantitative IgG test (SQT)., METHODS: The study was conducted from 2nd to 31th May 2020. 38 HWs were tested by both SRT and SQT; 81 FMs were screened using SRT. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data., RESULTS: Of the 38 HWs, 2 (5,3%) showed IgG line at SRT, confirmed by SQT. 32 HWs decided self-isolation from the family during SARS-COV-2 spreading. Out of 81 FMs, 26 (32,1%) were found IgG positive at SRT. 11 (42%) of them had symptoms typical for COVID-19 in the study period. In two families, the HWs were the only negative case., CONCLUSIONS: General population's exposure to COVID-19 was less controlled than HWs' one. HWs experienced lower infection's rate than their families and did not represented a risk of transmission for relatives. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and neutralizing activity in donor and patient blood from the San Francisco Bay Area. We report very low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in two San Francisco Bay Area populations. Seropositivity was 0.26% in 387 hospitalized patients admitted for non-respiratory indications and 0.1% in 1,000 blood donors. We additionally describe the longitudinal dynamics of immunoglobulin-G, immunoglobulin-M, and in vitro neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients. Neutralizing antibodies rise in tandem with immunoglobulin levels following symptom onset, exhibiting median time to seroconversion within one day of each other, and there is >93% positive percent agreement between detection of immunoglobulin-G and neutralizing titers.	included
0	The Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among the Medical Oncology Staff of ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia: Efficacy of Preventive Measures. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of developing serious disease-related complications in case of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Oncology units should implement all possible preventive measures to reduce the risk of viral transmission by healthcare professionals (HCPs) to patients. We conducted a surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection among the staff members of the Medical Oncology Unit of ASST Spedali Civili in Brescia, one of the Italian areas most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether the recommended preventive measures, promptly implemented by the unit, have been effective in reducing the spread of the virus among the HCPs. Between February 24 and May 19, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 10 out of 76 healthy HCPs (13%). Six of them developed a symptomatic disease, leading to home quarantine, and four remained asymptomatic. The infection was revealed when a serology test was performed on all staff members of the unit. In seven HCPs, in which it was possible to trace the person-to-person infection, the contagion occurred as a result of unprotected contacts or partially protected with surgical masks. In particular, four asymptomatic HCPs did not stop working, but a widespread outbreak in the unit was avoided. Adherence to the recommended preventive strategies, in particular, wearing of surgical masks by both the HCPs and the patients, is effective in reducing and preventing the viral spread.© Copyright © 2020 Dalla Volta, Valcamonico, Pedersini, Fornaro, Tovazzi, Monteverdi, Baggi, Consoli, Ferrari, Grisanti, Conti, Amoroso, Bossi and Berruti.	included
0	Symptoms and immunoglobulin development in hospital staff exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Background: Worldwide, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is increasing. Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. Result(s): Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. Conclusion(s): We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and seroprevalence among high-risk health care workers and hospital staff. Staff members from Covid-19 highly exposed units were invited to participate in a six month study of SARS-CoV-2 carriage and seroprevalence. The results of Day 1 and Day 15 visits show that 41 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology in 326 participants (overall infection rate=12.6%). Having co-morbidity or symptoms at the time of collection was a risk factor for infection but not working as a physician/nurse. This universal screening in high-risk units irrespective of symptoms allowed asymptomatic and potentially contagious infected workers to be self-isolated during 7 days. Copyright © 2020.

0	COVID-19 Symptoms, Duration, and Prevalence Among Healthcare Workers in the New York Metropolitan Area. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate symptoms, workforce implications and testing patterns from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the New York metropolitan area during Spring 2020., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of Occupational Health Services (OHS) records., SETTING: A large urban academic medical center with five inpatient campuses and multiple ambulatory centers throughout Bronx and Westchester counties., PARTICIPANTS: HCWs who called OHS to report COVID-19 symptoms and had either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR or IgG antibody testing., METHODS: We analyzed the impact of COVID-19 related symptoms on: 1) time from symptom onset to return to work, 2) results of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR testing, and 3) results of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing in HCWs with mild-moderate COVID-19., RESULTS: The median time from symptom onset until return to work for HCWs who did not require hospitalization was 15 days (interquartile range 10, 22 days). Shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, and diarrhea were significantly associated with longer durations from symptom onset to return to work. 51.9% of symptomatic HCWs with PCR testing during the study period tested positive. Of the previously symptomatic HCWs who had IgG antibody testing, 55.4% had reactive tests. Ageusia was associated with having both positive PCR and reactive antibody tests. Sore throat was associated with both negative PCR and nonreactive antibody tests., CONCLUSION: HCWs with COVID-19 who did not require hospitalization still had prolonged illness. Shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, and diarrhea are associated with longer durations of time out from work.	false
0	Routine blood tests as an active surveillance to monitor COVID-19 prevalence. A retrospective study. BACKGROUND: In Italy, one of the country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first autochthonous case appeared in Lombardy on February 20th, 2020. One month later, the number of -COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be -highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed., RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts., CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found. Thus, the virus was likely circulating, within the Hospital catchment area, either in low amounts or through asymptomatic individuals. Because of the high LDH and AST levels' variations induced by COVID-19, routine blood tests might be exploited as a surveillance indicator for a possible second wave.	false
0	Clusters of COVID-19 in long-term care hospitals and facilities - Japan, Jan 15-May 9, 2020. AIM: To clarify the association of cluster number and size of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in long-term care (LTC) hospitals/facilities, general medical/welfare facilities, and non-medical/welfare facilities, with morbidity and mortality in 47 prefectures during Jan 15 - May 9, 2020 in Japan., METHODS: Information on COVID-19 clusters (n >2) and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 was collected., RESULTS: A total of 381 clusters with 3,786 infected cases were collected, accounting for 23.9% of 15,852 cumulated cases on May 9, 2020. Although the cluster number (/107 subjects) in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly smaller compared to those in the other two groups, the cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly larger than that in non-medical/welfare facilities. Cluster numbers in general medical/welfare facilities and in non-medical/welfare facilities were significantly positively correlated with morbidity (/105 ), indicating relatively early identification of clusters in these facilities. Unlike in these facilities, cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly positively correlated with morbidity, indicating that clusters in LCT hospitals/facilities were finally identified after already having grown to a large size in areas where infection was prevalent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both cluster number and cluster size only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently associated with higher mortality (> median: 0.64/105 subjects) after adjustment., CONCLUSIONS: Preventive efforts against COVID-19 outbreaks even at the early phase of the epidemic are critically important in LTC hospitals/facilities, since both larger number and size of cluster only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently linked to higher mortality in prefectures in Japan. <248 words>.

0	Prevalence of Covid-19 Infection and Subsequent Cohorting in a Residential Substance Use Treatment Program in Boston, MA. OBJECTIVES: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect persons in congregate settings, including those in residential substance use treatment facilities. To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through congregate settings, universal testing may be necessary. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a residential treatment program setting and to understand the unique challenges of Covid-19 transmission in this setting., METHODS: We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result., RESULTS: A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit. Two positive cases resided together with two negative cases in a 4-person room. Two other positive cases resided together in a 2-person room. One positive case resided with two negative cases in a 3-person room. One positive case resided with a negative case in a 2-person room. Based on test results, residents were cohorted by infection status and continued to participate in addiction treatment on-site., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among staff and residents within a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in residential substance use programs can be instituted to reduce the risk of further transmission and continue addiction treatment programming when accompanied by adequate space, supplies, and staffing.	false
0	COVID-19 in Children, Pregnancy and Neonates: A Review of Epidemiologic and Clinical Features. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe. In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

0	Serological Analysis of New York City COVID19 Convalescent Plasma Donors. BACKGROUND: The development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, following infection or vaccination, is likely to be critical for the development of sufficient population immunity to drive cessation of the COVID19 pandemic. A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, these tests have substantially variable sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of NAbs is unknown., METHODS: We determined levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated those measurements with neutralization activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection., FINDINGS: Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, we found particular commercially available tests are capable of accurately measuring levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with neutralization assays., INTERPRETATION: Our findings imply that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors have a wide range of antibody concentrations. At present it is unclear how antibody acquisition, particularly for low titer individuals, might afford future immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Further research will be required to determine the minimum threshold of antibody and neutralization activity necessary to accurately predict immunity. Correlation of clinical antibody tests with neutralization activity in this study could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) Infection among Health Care Workers and Implications for Prevention Measures in a Tertiary Hospital in Wuhan, China. Importance: Health care workers (HCWs) have high infection risk owing to treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited. Objective(s): To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Result(s): Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P <.001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.Copyright © 2020 Lai X et al.	false
0	Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation. Background: Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. Method(s): In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. Finding(s): Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1.4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. Interpretation(s): Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

0	Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and its temporal association to IgG seropositivity. Longitudinal characterization of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from COVID-19 patient's nasopharynx and its juxtaposition with blood-based IgG-seroconversion diagnostic assays is critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection durations. Here, we retrospectively analyze 851 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with at least two positive PCR tests and find that 99 of these patients remain SARS-CoV-2-positive after 4 weeks from their initial diagnosis date. For the 851-patient cohort, the mean lower bound of viral RNA shedding was 17.3 days (SD: 7.8), and the mean upper bound of viral RNA shedding from 668 patients transitioning to confirmed PCR-negative status was 22.7 days (SD: 11.8). Among 104 patients with an IgG test result, 90 patients were seropositive to date, with mean upper bound of time to seropositivity from initial diagnosis being 37.8 days (95% CI: 34.3-41.3). Our findings from juxtaposing IgG and PCR tests thus reveal that some SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are non-hospitalized and seropositive, yet actively shed viral RNA (14 of 90 patients). This study emphasizes the need for monitoring viral loads and neutralizing antibody titers in long-term non-hospitalized shedders as a means of characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 infection lifecycle.	false
0	Corona in Children: the Co-Ki Study: Relevance of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient pediatric services in Germany. Background: In Germany over 80% of children and adolescents are in the ambulatory care of registered pediatricians. These have a specific perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): For this reason, this professional group initiated a central recording of case numbers, individual case descriptions and observations on infections and illnesses with SARS-CoV-2 (www.co-ki.de). Result(s): So far 557 pediatricians have participated. Together they care for ca. 670,000 children. They reported 9803 children who presented as suspected cases. The pediatricians themselves had a clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 3654 children. In 7707 children PCR tests were carried out using nose/throat swabs of which 198 (2.6%) were positive. In addition, 731 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with detection in 82 cases (11.2%). Despite initially positive PCR tests, 47 children had a negative antibody test at least 2 weeks later. Our query as to infections of adults by children yielded only one case, which a telephone enquiry revealed as unlikely. Discussion(s): From an outpatient pediatric perspective COVID-19 is rare. There was no convincing evidence that children are a relevant source of infection for SARS-CoV-2 nor that they are relevantly at risk.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Symptoms and symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based populations: Results from a statewide epidemiological study. Background: Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods., Methods: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection., Results: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection., Conclusions: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials., Research in Context: Evidence before this study: Using multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms. Added value of this study: This study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients. Implication of all the available evidence: Combining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms., Key points: Important symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection.	false
0	Interpretive discrepancies caused by target values inter-batch variations in chemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG by MAGLUMITM. Plasma specimens from COVID-19 patients were double-tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by two different batches of MAGLUMITM 2019-nCov IgM/IgG assays to evaluate IgM/IgG levels, qualitative interpretation, antibody kinetics and linearity of diluted specimen. Here we show that (i) high-level IgM specimens need to be diluted with negative human plasma but not kit diluents and (ii) measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG concentrations are substantially higher with later marketed immunoassay batch leading to (iii) the change of qualitative interpretation (positive vs. negative) in 12.3 % of specimens measured for IgM, (iv) the informative time-course pattern of antibody production only when data from different immunoassay batches are not combined.

0	"236 Access to Covid-19 Testing by Homeless/Housing-Insecure Individuals in Northeast Ohio. Study Objectives: Homelessness and housing insecurity is a global public health issue that leads to increased mortality from a multitude of health conditions and low life expectancy. The complex interplay between medical, psychiatric and social factors raises questions about how this population accesses available health care resources. This is magnified in times of global health crises, such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients experiencing housing insecurity may have limited access to health care resources, and live in settings, such as homeless shelters, that place them at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions in this population puts them at high risk for developing severe illness associated with COVID-19. Therefore, how this population accesses COVID-19 testing is of public health interest. This study's objective was to compare the testing patterns of homeless/housing insecure patients for COVID-19, as well as results, compared to the general population across a large health system. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 15, 2020 were included, including drive-through, emergency department (ED)-based and inpatient testing. Homeless/housing-insecure patients were identified based on a previously utilized address-based registry: patients listing their address as ""homeless"" or using the address of transitional housing/homeless shelter during at least one ED visit across the health system between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics were calculated and compared with Chi-squared testing. Result(s): During the study period, 21,561 patients were tested for COVID-19, 94 of whom were identified as homeless/housing insecure (0.4%). 3/94 of these patients (3.2%) tested positive for COVID-19, compared to 2,027/21,467 patients (9.4%) in the general population. Out of all patients tested, 12,776 patients had a testing site listed, 78 of whom were homeless/housing insecure. Homeless/housing insecure individuals were significantly more likely to be tested for COVID-19 in the ED setting rather than drive-through testing, X2 (1, N = 12718) = 22.8, p <.00001) [Table 1]. Conclusion(s): In a regional health system during the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless and housing-insecure patients were reliant on the ED to access COVID-19 testing. Despite risk factors in this population for disease transmission, patients had a low likelihood of testing positive, suggesting that the disease is likely underdiagnosed in this population. Expanding testing availability outside of the ED may improve COVID-19 detection and interventions in homeless and housing insecure individuals, and thus inform public health interventions to reduce disease transmission in this high risk population.

0	COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 17 (Fortnightly reporting period ending 24 May 2020). Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 24 May 2020: notifications = 7,135; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. There have been no cases reported in SA, the NT or the ACT in the last four weeks. The numbers of new cases reported from other jurisdictions continue to be very low. Testing rates have been higher across all jurisdictions, with Victoria reporting an 85% testing rate increase and NSW a 40% increase over this period. The positivity rate nationally continues to remain very low at less than 0.1% over the reporting period. Continued high rates of testing are necessary to detect and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Over the past fortnight, 45% of cases acquired their infection overseas. Of cases considered to be locally acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. A small proportion of cases overall have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease in Australia. In addition, the median number of days between symptom onset and diagnostic testing has improved considerably from 7 days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1 day in the latest phase of the epidemic. Internationally, as at 24 May 2020, there have been recent increases in the number of daily cases reported globally. The largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 6.5%. Countries in South America are starting to see rapid acceleration, while the United States is seeing a very slow decline in its daily new case numbers. In the South East Asia region, India and Bangladesh are seeing accelerating epidemics, compounded by the recovery from Cyclone Amphan. Increasing numbers of cases are also being reported in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific there are very few daily new cases reported.Copyright © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.	false
0	The relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections among close contacts. Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic. A recent study in China showed that transmissibility of the asymptomatic cases is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

0	Age-Dependent Risks of Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and Other Parts of China. The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Wang, Zhong, Bao, Li, Liu, Wang and He.	false
0	"Adaptive immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Introduction: The adaptive immune response is made up of T and B lymphocytes. Both types of lymphocytes are responsible for cell-mediated immunity and subsequent antibody production. Objective(s): To deepen the immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to the specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): A bibliographic review was carried out in the US National Library of Medicine, through the PubMed search engine of the articles published during the first half of 2020, with the terms ""SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19"" more ""immunopathology"". Development: The adaptive immune response is essential in the elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is made up of different cellular components, among which are: CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. In a subgroup of patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, the activation of both types of lymphocytes seems to be disproportionate, being greater in those with severe clinical manifestations. In severe patients, lymphocyte depletion is greater for CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes than for CD3 + CD4 + and B T cells, respectively. Conclusion(s): When the adaptive immune response is poorly modulated, it causes a state of hyperinflammation that leads to severe clinical manifestations and tissue damage. The identification of severity prediction biomarkers and the existence of ""immunophenotypes"" of COVID-19 patients based on the type of integrated immune response of T and B cells, makes it possible to apply immunomodulatory treatments in a more personalized way.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

0	Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on acute stroke care. Background and purpose: There are concerns that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak negatively affects the quality of care for acute cardiovascular conditions. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trends in hospital admissions and workflow parameters of acute stroke care in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Method(s): We used data from the three hospitals that provide acute stroke care for the Amsterdam region. We compared two 7-week periods: one during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 16th-May 3th 2020) and one prior to the outbreak (October 21st-December 8th 2019). We included consecutive patients who presented to the emergency departments with a suspected stroke and assessed the change in number of patients as an incidence-rate ratio (IRR) using a Poisson regression analysis. Other outcomes were the IRR for stroke subtypes, change in use of reperfusion therapy, treatment times, and in-hospital complications. Result(s): During the COVID-19 period, 309 patients presented with a suspected stroke compared to 407 patients in the pre-COVID-19 period (IRR 0.76 95%CI 0.65-0.88). The proportion of men was higher during the COVID-19 period (59% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). There was no change in the proportion of stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.58) or endovascular thrombectomy (11% vs 12%, p = 0.82) or associated treatment times. Seven patients (all ischemic strokes) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): We observed a 24% decrease in suspected stroke presentations during the COVID-19 outbreak, but no evidence for a decrease in quality of acute stroke care.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	COVID-19 patients in intensive care develop predominantly oliguric acute kidney injury. Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk. Method(s): In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP-2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission. The majority (n = 51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n = 37, 65%), whereas stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30-day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n = 9 (17%) patients. Conclusion(s): A majority of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU develop AKI. The functional deficit is often low urinary volume, and initial levels of biomarkers are generally increased without clear relation to final AKI stage.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China: a second derivative analysis of the cumulative daily diagnosed cases during the first 85 days. Background: Controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic requires information beyond new and cumulative cases. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei., Methods: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients' recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata., Results: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined., Conclusion: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long. In addition to re-evaluating the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, this study provided a model for monitoring outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries across the world.

0	Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 complicated with pleural effusion. BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were well delineated. However, no researches described the patients complicated with pleural effusion (PE). In the present study, we aimed to clinically characterize the COVID-19 patients complicated with PE and to create a predictive model on the basis of PE and other clinical features to identify COVID-19 patients who may progress to critical condition., METHODS: This retrospective study examined 476 COVID-19 inpatients, involving 153 patients with PE and 323 without PE. The data on patients' past history, clinical features, physical checkup findings, laboratory results and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected and analyzed. LASSO regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19., RESULTS: Laboratory findings showed that patients with PE had higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, lactic dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer, and lower levels of lymphocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation. Meanwhile, patients with PE had higher incidence of severe or critical illness and mortality rate, and longer hospital stay time compared to their counterparts without pleural effusion. Moreover, LASSO regression analysis exhibited that pleural effusion, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and total bilirubin (TBIL) might be risk factors for critical COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusion could serve as an indicator for severe inflammation and poor clinical outcomes, and might be a complementary risk factor for critical type of COVID-19.	false
0	Urinary SARS-CoV-2 RNA is An Indicator For The Progression and Prognosis of COVID-19 Disease. <h4>Background: </h4> We aimed to analyse clinical characteristics and find potential factors predicting poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <h4>Methods: </h4> We analyzed the demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments collected from 53 COVID-19 patients enrolled in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 31, 2020 to February 18, 2020 with qRT-PCR analysis, and then classified those patients based on clinical conditions (severe or non-severe syndrome) and urinary SARS-CoV-2 RNA (U RNA - or U RNA + ). <h4>Results: </h4>: We found that COVID-19 patients with severe syndrome (severe patients) showed significantly higher positive rate (11 of 23, 47.8%) of urinary SARS-CoV-2 RNA than non-severe patients (4 of 30, 13.3%, p = 0.006). U RNA + patients or severe U RNA + subgroup exhibited higher prevalence of inflammation and immune discord, cardiovascular diseases, liver damage and renal disfunction, and higher risk of death than U RNA - patients. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying the viral urine shedding, we performed renal histopathological analysis on postmortems of patients with COVID-19 and found that severe renal vascular endothelium lesion characterized by increase of the expression of thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor, markers to assess the endothelium dysfunction. We proposed a theoretical and mathematic model to depict the potential factors determining the urine shedding of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> This study indicated that urinary SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in urine specimens can be used to predict the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 severity.	false
0	Evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on dispensing patterns: a national cohort analysis. <h4>Background</h4> Medication prescribing and dispensing often regarded as one of the most effective ways to manage and improve population health. Prescribed and dispensed medications can be monitored through data linkage for each patient. We hypothesised that changes in patient care resulting from COVID-19, changed the way patients access their prescribed medication. <h4>Objective</h4> To develop an efficient approach for evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on drug dispensing patterns. <h4>Methods</h4> Retrospective observational study using national patient-level dispensing records in Wales-UK. Total dispensed drug items between 01-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2019 (counterfactual pre-COVID-19) were compared to 2020 (COVID-19 year). We compared trends of dispensed items in three main British National Formulary (BNF) sections(Cardiovascular system, Central Nervous System, Immunological & Vaccine) using European Age-Standardized rates. We developed an online tool to enable monitoring of changes in dispensing as the pandemic evolves. <h4>Result</h4> Amongst all BNF chapters, 52,357,639 items were dispensed in 2020 compared to 49,747,141 items in 2019 demonstrating a relative increase of 5.25% in 2020(95%CI[5.21,5.29]). Comparison of monthly patterns of 2020 and 2019 dispensed items showed a notable difference between the total number of dispensed drug items each month, with an average difference (D) of +290,055 and average Relative Change (RC) of +5.52%. The greatest RC was observed in a substantial March-2020 increase (D=+1,501,242 and RC=+28%), followed by second peak in June (D=+565,004, RC=+10.97%). May was characterised by lower dispensing (D=-399,244, RC=-5.9%). Cardiovascular categories were characterised, across all age groups, by dramatic March-2020 increases, at the epidemic peak, followed by months of lower than expected dispensing, and gradual recovery by September. The Central Nervous System category was similar, but with only a short decline in May, and quicker recovery. A stand-out grouping was Immunological and Vaccine, which dropped to very low levels across all age groups, and all months (including the March dispensing peak). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Aberration in clinical service delivery during COVID-19 led to substantial changes in community pharmacy drug dispensing. This change may contribute to a long-term burden of COVID-19, raising the importance of a comprehensive and timely monitoring of changes for evaluation of the potential impact on clinical care and outcomes	false
0	‘Trained immunity’ from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous ‘trained immunity’ conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. ( i . e ., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of ‘trained immunity’ of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se . It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.	false
0	Longitudinal Analysis of Inflammatory Response to SARS-CoV-2 in the Upper Respiratory Tract Reveals an Association With Viral Load, Independent of Symptoms. <h4>Background: </h4> SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract that may be determinant in virus dissemination. The extent of intranasal antiviral response in relation to symptoms is unknown. Understanding how local innate responses control virus is key in the development of therapeutic approaches.MethodsSARS-CoV-2-infected patients were enrolled in an observational study conducted at the Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland, investigating virological and immunological characteristics. Nasal-wash and serum specimens from a subset of patients were collected to measure viral load and a cytokine panel at different time points after infection; cytokine levels were analyzed in relation to symptoms.ResultsSamples from 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and six controls were analyzed. We found an increase in CXCL10 and IL-6, whose levels remained elevated for up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced CCL2 and GM-CSF, suggesting local recruitment and activation of myeloid cells. Local cytokine levels correlated with viral load but not with serum cytokine levels, nor with specific symptoms, including anosmia.ConclusionsThe nasal epithelium is an active site of cytokine response against SARS-CoV-2 that can last more than 2 weeks; in this cohort, anosmia was not associated with increases in any locally produced cytokines.	false
0	Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) as novel inflammatory marker with prognostic significance in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Background: </h4> Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW), a new cytometric parameter correlating with cytomorphologic changes occurring during massive monocyte activation, has recently been described as promising early biomarker of sepsis. Similar to sepsis, in SARS-CoV-2-associated disease (COVID-19) monocyte/macrophage subsets are considered key mediators of the life-threatening hyper-inflammatory disorder –commonly defined as ‘cytokine storm’– which is part of the complex infection-associated immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 cases (possibly constituting a kind of viral sepsis). Therefore, in this work, we aimed at investigating, for the first time, possible roles of MDW testing in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods: </h4> We longitudinally measured MDW values (readily available along with automated blood cell count) in a cohort of 87 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, consecutively admitted to our clinics in early 2020, due to aggravation of their clinical status. Statistical analyses were then applied to correlate MDW values with inflammatory markers, disease severity, clinical trajectories and final outcome. <h4>Results: </h4>: We initially found significant direct correlations between MDW and different inflammatory markers routinely assessed during hospitalization, namely CRP (p<0.001), fibrinogen (p<0.001) and ferritin (p<0.01). Moreover, high MDW values resulted remarkably associated with fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 patients (AUC=0.76, 95% CI: 0.66-0.87, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.70, MDW threshold 26.4; RR=4.91, 95% CI: 1.73-13.96; OR=7.14, 95% CI: 2.06-24.71). Furthermore, when evaluating MDW dynamics in COVID-19 cases with longer follow-up, we frequently observed progressive MDW increment in patients with worsening inflammation, while clinical recovery was consistently associated with MDW decrease. Of note, MDW evaluation may also help to assess the response to immunomodulatory treatments, such as tocilizumab. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Our pilot study shows that MDW can be useful in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients, as this innovative hematologic biomarker is (i) easy and rapid to obtain, (ii) directly related to the activation state of a fundamental inflammatory cell subset (i.e. monocytes, pivotal in both cytokine storm and sepsis immunopathogenesis), (iii) well correlated with clinical severity of COVID-19-associated inflammatory disorder, and, in turn, (iv) endowed with relevant prognostic significance. Additional studies are needed to define further the clinical impact of MDW testing in the management of COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Relapse of chilblain-like lesions during the second wave of COVID-19. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is ongoing. After a reduction of the spread during summer in Western Countries, a rise of incidence has been registered in the last few months. During the first pandemic wave we described an outbreak of chilblain-like lesions (CLL), affecting in particular children and young adults.1,2 Similar lesions were also observed in many other dermatologic centers.3,4 While in summer no more patients with CLL have been reported, during the second wave of infection we faced again new cases of CLL (n=10, F/M=9/1, average age 16.6 years).

0	The telemedical imperative. Technology presents a means of improving health outcomes for vast numbers of individuals. It has historically been deployed to streamline healthcare delivery and reach those who would previously have faced obstacles to accessing services. It has also enabled improved health education and management. Telemedicine can be employed in everything from primary care consultations to the monitoring of chronic diseases. Despite recommendation by the World Health Organization, countries have been slow to embrace such technology in the health sector. Nonetheless, it is expected to become more prevalent with increased digitization. Further, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rush to implement forms of telemedicine where possible to prevent patients breaking social distancing rules. In this paper, I present and defend what I term the 'telemedical imperative'. The telemedical imperative represents a duty for healthcare systems to implement remote access to services where possible, thereby furthering the mission of equity in access to healthcare. It is intended as an addition to in-person services rather than a replacement. After highlighting the benefits of telemedicine, I provide four criteria that must be met for the telemedical imperative to arise. The first three-safety, effectiveness, and acceptability-are consistent and essential. The fourth adapts to the service in question and requires that there be no other obstacles specific to that service that cannot reasonably be overcome. Finally, I address several potential objections to the telemedical imperative based on more general concerns around the implementation of telemedicine. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	The Era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Review on Dynamics, Clinical Symptoms and Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) displays a broad spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from lack of symptoms to severe multiorgan system complications and death. Various laboratory assays have been employed in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including: nucleic acid-based tests; antigen tests; and serum testing for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. The disease can also be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical features and radiological findings. Until now, remdesivir is the only medication approved for the treatment of COVID-19 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, it is anticipated that several anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies will gain soon approval. Other methods of treatment include supportive care directed toward treating the symptoms. Nevertheless, many studies have recently emerged, showing controversial preliminary results with the off-label medication hydroxychloroquine. Given that all results are still preliminary, including those seen by remdesivir, additional evidence and research are required to identify effective medications that are broadly effective and well tolerated. Importantly, two RNA-based vaccines have recently gained approval from Pfizer and Moderna, with many others still in clinical trials. This article reviews various aspects of COVID-19, including its epidemiology; its evolution and mutational spectrum; and its clinical dynamics, symptoms and complications, diagnosis, and treatment.	false
0	Neutralizing and binding activities against SARS-CoV-1/2, MERS-CoV, and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 by normal human intravenous immunoglobulin derived from healthy donors in Japan. Background: There are several types of coronaviruses that infect humans and cause disease. The latest is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging global threat with no current effective treatment. Normal intravenous immunoglobulin (N-IVIG) has been administered to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to control severe inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, the neutralizing activity of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether N-IVIG manufactured before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contained IgG antibodies against the circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cross-react with the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been reported in Japan. Study Design and Methods: The neutralizing and binding activities of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV 229E, and HCoV OC43 were evaluated. Nine N-IVIG lots manufactured between 2000 and 2018, derived from donors in Japan, were tested. Binding activity was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Result(s): None of the N-IVIG lots tested displayed neutralizing or binding activity against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2. However, they displayed substantial neutralizing and binding activity against HCoV OC43 and weak neutralizing and substantial binding activity against HCoV 229E. Conclusion(s): N-IVIG derived from healthy donors in Japan before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had no direct effect against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are warranted to determine the effects of N-IVIG manufactured after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 AABB	false
0	COVID-19 associated with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Background: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has many known disease associations, including autoimmune, lymphoproliferative, and certain infectious diseases, as well as various medications. Studies have found that severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with coagulopathies; however, the potential association with AIHA is not clear. Case Report: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID-19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions before clinical stabilization. Discussion(s): AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA; however, there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID-19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID-19 are discussed. Conclusion(s): There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.Copyright © 2020 AABB	false
0	Significant decrease of facial cellulitis admissions during COVID-19 lockdown in France: a multicentric comparative study. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in France during the first wave. An apparent decrease in incidence of cellulitis of odontogenic origin was noticed then. This study aimed to compare the incidence of cellulitis during this extraordinary period with the same period in 2018 and 2019, based on retrospective multicentric data. All maxillofacial surgery departments in French public hospitals were contacted. Responders were asked to include all patients admitted for the surgical drainage of a head and neck abscess of odontogenic origin during the first 2020 lockdown period, and in a similar time frame in 2018 and 2019 (control group), based on screening the French diagnostic and therapeutic classification of medical acts. We report a 44% significant nationwide decrease in the incidence of admissions for cellulitis. There was 187 patients in 2020 for 334 and 333 patients in 2018/2019 respectively. The reasons to explain this finding are hypothetical (organizational reasons leading to earlier management, patients' fear to seek for medical management, usual excess in surgical indications or concomitant decrease of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs delivery). Whatever the explanation, it would be of great interest to find it out in order to improve the prevention of cellulitis.198 words. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.	false
0	The clinical manifestations and interval changes of reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions among different specimens of coronavirus disease 2019 patients. BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a number of cases and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been reported worldwide. In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHOD(S): The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULT(S): From March 2020 to April 2020, 4 SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.Copyright © 2020, the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	Implementation and evaluation of a COVID-19 rapid follow-up service for patients discharged from the emergency department. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid adaptation of healthcare providers to new clinical and logistical challenges. Following identification of high levels of emergency department (ED) reattendance among patients with suspected COVID-19 at our centre, we piloted a rapid remote follow-up service for this patient group. We present our service framework and evaluation of our pilot cohort of 192 patients. We followed up patients by telephone within 36 hours of their ED attendance. Pulse oximetry was used for remote monitoring of a subset of patients. Patients required between one and six consecutive telephone assessments, dependent on illness severity, and 23 patients were recalled for in-person assessment. Approximately half of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 required onward referral for respiratory follow-up. This framework reduced unplanned ED reattendances in comparison with a retrospective comparator cohort (4.7% from 22.6%). We reproduced these findings in a validation cohort with a high prevalence of acute COVID-19, managed through the clinic in September-October 2020, where we identified an unplanned ED reattendance rate of 5.2%. We propose that rapid remote follow-up is a mechanism by which ambulatory patients can be clinically supported during the acute phase of illness, with benefits both to patient care and to health service resilience.Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2021.

0	The influence of risk perception for COVID-19 pandemic on posttraumatic stress disorder in healthcare workers: A survey from four designated hospitals. The aim of current study was to investigate risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality and time change of leisure activity and their correlations with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in healthcare workers (HCWs) from four designated hospitals in China. Medical staffs (n = 317) from three designated hospitals in Guangdong Province and one designated hospital in Guangxi Province were surveyed on their demographic information, sleep quality and time change of leisure activity, risk perception of pandemic and PTSD symptoms (by using PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)). Hierarchical regression and structural equation model (SEM) were used to examine the correlated factors of PTSD. The prevalence of high level of PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 > =33, a probable diagnosis of PTSD) was 10.7%. Regression analysis found that risk perception (dread: beta = 0.142, p < 0.01; familiarity: beta = 0.203, p < 0.01), sleep quality (beta = 0.250, p < 0.001), time change of leisure activity (beta = -0.179, p < 0.01), were independently correlated with PTSD severity, which was further confirmed by SEM. Locations of COVID-19-related hazards were significant different in cognitive map of risk perception between groups with high and low levels of PTSD symptoms. Risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic influenced PTSD symptoms in HCWs. Adequate time for leisure activity and good sleep quality protected some HCWs against PTSD symptoms under the influence of pandemic. More researches were warranted to understand the path from pre-factors of risk perception to its psychological consequences among HCWs. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	false
0	High Rates of COVID-19 Infection Among Indigenous Maya at a US Safety-Net Health System in California. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately and negatively affected communities of color in the United States, especially Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations. We report a cluster of COVID-19 cases among the Maya in Alameda County, California, most of whom were misclassified in public health data as nonindigenous Spanish-speaking people. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all COVID-19 tests performed from April 1 through May 31, 2020, at Alameda Health System. A total of 1561 tests from 1533 patients were performed, with an overall test positivity rate of 17.0% (N = 265). We used the language field from the electronic health record to identify 29 patients as speaking an indigenous Mayan language; by medical record review, we identified 52 additional Maya patients. Maya patients had a test positivity rate of 72.8% as compared with 27.1% (P < .001) for nonindigenous Latinx patients and 8.2% (P < .001) for all other patients. In our sample, 39.6% of patients who had a positive test result for COVID-19 were hospitalized, 11.3% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% died of COVID-19. Maya patients had lower rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-Maya patients. We shared our data with the county health department to inform responses for education, testing, and isolation for Maya patients in Alameda County. Ongoing COVID-19 public health efforts should assess the community prevalence of COVID-19 in the Maya community and other indigenous communities and implement interventions that are linguistically and culturally appropriate.	false
0	Polymerase-chain reaction testing to prevent hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Shinjuku, an epicenter in Tokyo: The Tokyo Women's Medical University model. Hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a healthcare challenge. We hypothesized that polymerase chain reaction testing of symptomatic triaged outpatients and all inpatients before hospitalization in Shinjuku, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter in Tokyo, using the Tokyo Women's Medical University (TMWU) model would be feasible and efficient at preventing COVID-19. This retrospective study enrolled 2981 patients from March to May 2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.81% (95% credible interval [CI]: 0.95-3.47%) in triaged symptomatic outpatients, 0.04% (95% CI: 0.0002-0.2%) in scheduled asymptomatic inpatients, 3.78% (95% CI: 1.82-7.26%) in emergency inpatients, and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.49-3.82%) in symptomatic patients. There were no cases of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. This shows that the TWMU model could prevent hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection and is feasible and effective in reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hospitals. Copyright © 2021.

0	INSIGHT: A population-scale COVID-19 testing strategy combining point-of-care diagnosis with centralized high-throughput sequencing. We present INSIGHT [isothermal NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) sequencing-based high-throughput test], a two-stage coronavirus disease 2019 testing strategy, using a barcoded isothermal NASBA reaction. It combines point-of-care diagnosis with next-generation sequencing, aiming to achieve population-scale testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients. It gives results within 1 to 2 hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow readout, while simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes. The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95% limit of detection is <50 copies of viral RNA per reaction. INSIGHT is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based, point-of-care assay and is potentially scalable to the population level.

0	CLINICAL MANIFESTATION, COMORBIDITIES AND OUTCOME OF FIRST 121 PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN BABYLON PROVINCE, IRAQ. The number of patients discovered to have COVID-19 in Babylon province is increasing. Since 28 February 2020 (the date of the first case of COVID-19 discovered in Babylon). Being, it is a new disease data needs to be taken regarding clinical features, the effect of comorbidities and outcome. A prospective observational study involved all patients diagnosed by PCR with COVID-19 in Babylon province between 28 February to 31 May 2020 (121 patients). Data were studied regarding the severity of illness, clinical features, the effect of age, gender, residence, smoking and comorbidities on the severity, value of CRP and outcome of the patients. Mean age of the patients was 34 years, 51.2% females, 48.8% males. Most of the cases occurred in Al Hilla city. 78.5% gave a history of contact with locally infected patients. 4 health care workers got the disease. There were 45.5% asymptomatic patients, 38% had mild disease and 16.5% with moderate to severe disease. The most common symptoms were: fever 69.7%, cough 60.6% and shortness of breath 39.3%. CRP was positive in 48.8%. 83.5% of patients didn't require O2. The disease was significantly more severe with increasing age and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal disease. 6 patients died (5%) and all of them had comorbidities. Most of the cases come from direct contact, reflecting the spread of the disease locally. The absence of fever and cough doesn't exclude the diagnosis. CRP is invalid in confirming the diagnosis, but is valid in the assessment of the severity. More care is required to be given to the patient with COVID-19, if they are elderly or had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or renal disease.Copyright © 2020. All Rights Reserved.	false
0	Disassembly of HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer immunogens is driven by antibodies elicited via immunization. Rationally designed protein subunit vaccines are being developed for a variety of viruses including influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. These vaccines are based on stabilized versions of the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies on the viral surface, namely viral fusion glycoproteins. While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non or weakly neutralizing (“off-target”) antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses. Our study provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds of the iterative vaccine design process.	false
0	Acceptance of a Symptom-Based Approach for COVID-19 rtRT-PCR Testing to Conserve Resources in a Lower Middle-Income Setting. SARS-CoV-2 initially emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.	false
0	Increased Intracranial Hemorrhage Amid Elevated Inflammatory Markers in those with COVID-19 Supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. COVID-19-related coagulopathy is a known complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can lead to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), one of the most feared complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We sought to evaluate the incidence and etiology of ICH in patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO. Patients at two academic medical centers with COVID-19 who required venovenous-ECMO support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were evaluated retrospectively. During the study period, 33 patients required ECMO support; 16 (48.5%) were discharged alive, 13 died (39.4%), and 4 (12.1%) had ongoing care. Eleven patients had ICH (33.3%). All ICH events occurred in patients who received intravenous anticoagulation. The ICH group had higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.04), and procalcitonin levels (p = 0.02), and IL-6 levels (p = 0.05), lower blood pH before and after ECMO (p < 0.01), and higher activated partial thromboplastin times throughout the hospital stay (p < 0.0001). ICH-free survival was lower in COVID-19 patients than in patients on ECMO for ARDS caused by other viruses (49% vs 79%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 can be successfully bridged to recovery using ECMO but may suffer higher rates of ICH compared to those with other viral respiratory infections.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse events in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors: an observational prospective study. BACKGROUND: In ambulatory patients with cancer with asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the safety of targeted therapies (TTs), chemotherapy (CT) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy is still unknown., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the start of the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Bergamo, Italy, we have prospectively screened all consecutive outpatients who presented for treatment to the Oncology Division of the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo for SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression. We identified patients treated with ICIs and compared these to patients with the same cancer subtypes treated with TTs or CT., RESULTS: Between March 5 and May 18, 293 consecutive patients (49% melanoma, 34% non-small cell lung cancer, 9% renal cell carcinoma, 8% other) were included in this study: 159 (54%), 50 (17%) and 84 (29%) received ICIs, CT or TTs, respectively. Overall 89 patients (30.0%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Mortality of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was statistically significantly higher compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (8/89 vs 3/204, respectively, Fisher's exact test p=0.004). All deaths were due to COVID-19. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative cases (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p=0.0008). The incidence of SAEs in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients was similar in ICI and CT patients (17.3% and 3.7% for positive and negative patients in ICIs and 15.4% and 2.7% in CT, Breslow-Day test p=0.891). No COVID-19-related SAEs were observed in the TTs patients., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAEs was higher for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated with ICIs and CT, mostly in advanced disease. No SAEs were observed in patients treated with TTs. SAEs were COVID-19 related rather than treatment related. Treatment with ICIs does not appear to significantly increase risk of SAEs compared with CT. This information should be considered when determining treatment options for patients.

0	The Plastic Surgeon's Role in the COVID-19 Crisis: Regarding Domestic Violence. Pandemics are associated with increased rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV-related physical abuse is most commonly inflicted through craniofacial assault and upper extremity injury. Plastic surgeons are frequently consulted for recommendations in the management of head-and-neck and hand trauma, thereby are uniquely positioned to encounter patients who have experienced IPV. However, IPV training is not routinely offered in surgical education. We provide a review of the increasing prevalence of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic and its pertinence to plastic surgery consultation in the emergency room. This article aims to increase providers' confidence in recognizing IPV-suspicious injuries and propose an educational, interactive tool for discussing IPV with patients.

0	Identification of potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 using virtual screening method. SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a major epidemic among people around the world, and it is the newest in the sequence to become prevalent among other infectious diseases. The drug repurposing concept has been utilized effectively for numerous viral infections. Considering the situation and the urgency, the idea of drug repurposing for coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is also being studied. The molecular docking method was used for the screening of 29 antiviral drugs against primary protease proteins (MPP) of SARS-CoV-2, spike ecto-domain, spike receptor binding domain, Nsp9 RNA binding protein, and HR2 domain. Among these drugs, in terms of least binding energy, Indinavir, Sorivudine, Cidofovir, and Darunavir showed minimum docking scores with all the key proteins. For ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) analysis, the ADMET properties of the top 4 drug candidates were retrieved through literature study. This analysis revealed that these drug candidates are well metabolized, distributed, and bioavailable, but have some undesirable effects. Furthermore, some approved structural analogues, such as Telbivudine, Tenofovir, Amprenavir, Fosamprenavir, etc., were predicted as similar drugs which may also be used for treating viral infections. We highly recommend these drug candidates as potential fighters against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus, and suggest in vivo trials for experimental validation of our findings.

0	ICAM-1 levels in patients with covid-19 with diabetic foot ulcers: A prospective study in southeast asia. Background: Viral infection can compound the severity of pre-existing inflammation caused by underlying diseases. For those with a chronic, immune-related condition such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) serves to exacerbate the inflammatory burden. Serum levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a primary mediator of cell adhesion express in the inflammatory process, are often used to indicate the gravity of all inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate serum ICAM-1 levels before and after debridement in patients with DFUs who were also diagnosed as COVID-19 positive compared with those who were COVID-19 negative., Methods: 20 patients with DFUs were screened for COVID-19 and then divided into COVID-19 positive and negative groups according to the results. Before debridement, chest x-rays and blood analysis, including ICAM-1 serum levels, were performed in both groups. Only ICAM-1 serum levels were measured after debridement., Results: Of the 20 patients included in this study, 55% were male (n = 11) and 45% were female (n = 9). The mean age was 52.9 +/- 1.9 years. ICAM-1 levels in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group (median 317.2 vs 149.2, respectively; p < 0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 reduced significantly in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group after debridement (median 312.5 vs 130.3; p < 0.001)., Conclusion: ICAM-1 serum levels represent an additional, initial screening marker for COVID-19.

0	Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity. <h4>SUMMARY</h4> Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.	false
0	Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol-induced blackout tweets. INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: COVID-19, considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization, overwhelmed hospitals in the USA. In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol-induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol-induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol-related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts. RESULT(S): More alcohol-related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the 'stay at home' orders (January to mid-March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Our findings demonstrate that references to high-risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID-19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID-19, and alcohol-related mortality can further tax hospital resources.Copyright © 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.	false
0	Vaccine Design, Adaptation, and Cloning Design for Multiple Epitope-Based Vaccine Derived From SARS-CoV-2 Surface Glycoprotein (S), Membrane Protein (M) and Envelope Protein (E): In silico approach. The SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a global epidemic that has increased the scientific community's concern about developing and finding a counteraction against this lethal virus. So far, hundreds of thousands of people have been infected by the pandemic due to contamination and spread. This research was therefore carried out to develop potential epitope-based vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. Three potential vaccine constructs were designed after intensive computational experimentation, and one vaccine model was chosen as the best vaccine based on a molecular docking analysis that is intended to work efficiently against SARS-CoV-2. In order to verify biological stability and find an appropriate mass production technique for the chosen vaccine, molecular dynamics simulation, and silico codon adaptation studies were subsequently carried out. This study should help to maintain current research efforts to secure a definitive preventive measure against this contagious disease.	false
0	Early estimation of the epidemiological parameters of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) outbreak in Iran: 19 Feb-15 March, 2020. Aim: To estimate the epidemiological parameters related to the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran., Background: Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran., Methods: We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation., Results: We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction., Conclusion: Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0<1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases. We additionally recommend that traffic restriction be combined with other controlling measures. Copyright ©2020 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.	false
0	Evidence that Ginkgo Biloba could use in the influenza and coronavirus COVID-19 infections. Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic invades the world. Public health evaluates the incidence of infections and death, which should be reduced and need desperately quarantines for infected individuals. This article review refers to the roles of Ginkgo Biloba to reduce the risk of infection in the respiratory tract, the details on the epidemiology of corona COVID-19 and influenza, and it highlights how the Ginko Biloba could have been used as a novel treatment.Ginkgo Biloba can reduce the risk of infection by several mechanisms; these mechanisms involve Ginkgo Biloba contains quercetin and other constituents, which have anti-inflammatory and immune modulator effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations. Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]). The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect. To assess those recommendations should be conducted with random control trials and extensive population studies. Copyright © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.	false
0	Immunoglobulin-A Vasculitis With Renal Involvement in a Patient With COVID-19: A Case Report and Review of Acute Kidney Injury Related to SARS-CoV-2. Rationale: Acute kidney injury is a common complication of COVID-19 and is associated with significantly increased mortality. The most frequent renal biopsy finding with SARS-CoV-2 infection is acute tubular injury; however, new onset glomerular diseases have been reported. The development of persistent urinary abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 should prompt consideration for renal biopsy to rule out glomerulonephritis. Presenting Concerns: A 30-year-old man with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with symptoms of COVID-19 and new onset painful purpuric rash, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed with nucleic acid testing and laboratory investigations revealed preserved renal function with dysmorphic hematuria and nephrotic range proteinuria. Diagnosis: A skin biopsy of the purpuric rash was performed, which demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Renal biopsy revealed focally crescentic and segmentally necrotizing IgA nephropathy. Overall, given the clinical syndrome of glomerulonephritis with purpuric rash, arthralgia, and abdominal pain, the presentation is most in keeping with a diagnosis of IgA vasculitis in the setting of COVID-19. Intervention(s): The patient was treated conservatively for COVID-19 in the community. A 7-day course of prednisone was started for the vasculitic rash. IgA nephropathy was managed conservatively with blood pressure control and RAAS blockade with losartan. Outcome(s): With conservative management, the patient's COVID-19 symptoms resolved completely and he did not require hospital admission. Following prednisone therapy, the patient's rash, arthralgia, and abdominal pain improved. However, despite resolution of COVID-19, hematuria and proteinuria persisted. With the initiation of RAAS blockade, renal function remained stable and proteinuria improved dramatically at 6 weeks. Novel Findings: De novo glomerulonephritis is a renal manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond acute tubular injury. IgA vasculitis appears to be a rare complication of COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	Making sense of spike D614G in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has evolved to adapt to human host and transmission over the past 12 months. One prominent adaptive mutation is the asparagine-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 in the viral spike protein (D614G), which has become dominant in the currently circulating virus strains. Since spike protein determines host ranges, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis through binding to the cellular receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the D614G mutation is hypothesized to enhance viral fitness in human host, leading to increased transmission during the global pandemic. Here we summarize the recent progress on the role of the D614G mutation in viral replication, pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine and therapeutic antibody development. These findings underscore the importance in closely monitoring viral evolution and defining their functions to ensure countermeasure efficacy against newly emerging variants.	false
0	COVID-19 infection in pregnant women: Review of maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women, their fetuses, and newborns are likely to represent a high-risk population during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Literature on the outcomes of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy is slowly building up. The aim of the present review was to gather evidence from relevant articles published in English from January to August 2020 in Medline and Google Scholar. The review revealed that pregnant women who become COVID-19-positive are usually either asymptomatic or mild-to-moderately symptomatic, similar to non-pregnant women. Pneumonia is one of the most common outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, it cannot be conclusively said that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. Pregnant women with COVID-19 with co-morbidities have increased risks of complications: there are regional variations in the rates of adverse outcomes reported. Though uncommon, the review shows that vertical transmission is possible. Additionally, the third trimester seems to be the most vulnerable period of infection. This aspect needs to be researched further to activate surveillance programs at the end of second trimester. Overall, it is necessary to monitor pregnant women before and after delivery, and their infants, during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics	false
0	A Study on Online Teaching and Learning Amid COVID-19 Pandemic in India. The outburst of the COVID-19 has proved to be one the noxious pandemic in the history of human civilization, irrespective of who&rsquo;s rich or poor. The world-wide impacts are severe and we need to take immediate action. Covid-19 was originated in China and now it has captured entire world. Most of the countries announced lockdown to prevent further spread of corona infection. Due to lockdown almost all social and economic activities along with traditional education got affected and it compelled all school and colleges to shift from offline education to online education system. In India, government has taken several initiatives to provide online education to students from class 1 to post graduation through many ways including use of TV channels or different websites. No doubt online education is need of the hour and current situation where maintaining social distance is essential, the importance of online education cannot be ignored. Through online education we can achieve both objectives i.e., maintaining social distance as well as continuity in learning. Online education market is getting space in India but still some improvement is necessary to make online learning more effective and efficient. We need to consider problems faced during online teaching and learning before relying on it completely. In this paper, the role of online learning in COVID-19 times, various government initiatives for online education and different challenges encountered in the online education system are being discussed.	false
0	Increased incidence of chalazion associated with face mask wear during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: To determine whether the incidence of chalazion increased significantly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County following the widespread adoption of face mask wear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter study of two ophthalmology institutions: a private Oculoplastics practice in San Francisco and the Oculoplastics division of the Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. All patients seen during the studied time periods with a diagnosis of chalazion or hordeolum were identified through review of electronic medical records and included in the study. Incidence was determined for each month between January and August 2020, and compared to data from prior years via ANOVA to evaluate for changes after the onset of the pandemic., Results: In San Francisco, the incidence of chalazion rose significantly in June through August of 2020 when compared to the same interval in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In Los Angeles, the rise in chalazion incidence in 2020 was also statistically significant when compared to data from the years 2018 and 2019., Conclusion: Importance: Widespread mask wear does appear to correspond to an increased incidence of chalazion. This risk may be minimized, while still maintaining the protective benefits of mask wear, by taking the proactive measures discussed to decrease mask induced eye dryness and changes in the eyelid microbiome.

0	Audiovestibular symptoms and sequelae in COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: since the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak a growing number of symptoms and deficits associated with the new pathology have emerged, among them cochlear damage in otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 patients has been described., OBJECTIVE: to investigate general and audiovestibular symptoms and sequelae in healed patients, and to seek for any sign of residual or permanent hearing or vestibular loss., METHODS: we reviewed the data coming from 48 Covid-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swabs have turned negative, all employed at our facility, that opted in for a free screening of audiovestibular symptoms offered by our hospital after the aforementioned report was published. The screening included a tonal pure tone audiometry, a vHIT and SHIMP test, as well as a survey including known symptoms and audiovestibular symptoms., RESULTS: general symptoms as reported by our patients largely reflect what reported by others in the literature. 4 (8.3%) patients reported hearing loss, 2 (4.2%) tinnitus, 4 dizziness (8.3%), 1 spinning vertigo (2%), 1 dynamic imbalance (2%), 3 static imbalance (6.3%). Most audiovestibular symptoms have regressed. Thresholds at pure tone audiometry and vHIT gain were within normality range in all post-Covid-19 patients., CONCLUSIONS: even if some patients suffer from audiovestibular symptoms, these are mostly transitory and there is no clear evidence of clinically relevant persistent cochlear or vestibular damage after recovery.	false
0	Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance, Vaccine Uptake, and Effectiveness at a Time of Cocirculating COVID-19: Protocol for the English Primary Care Sentinel System for 2020-2021. BACKGROUND: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) are commencing their 54th season of collaboration at a time when SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be cocirculating with the usual winter infections., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct surveillance of influenza and other monitored respiratory conditions and to report on vaccine uptake and effectiveness using nationally representative surveillance data extracted from primary care computerized medical records systems. We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research., METHODS: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval., RESULTS: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded. We are implementing a central swab distribution system for patients self-swabbing at home in addition to in-practice sampling. We have converted all our primary care coding to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) coding. Throughout spring and summer 2020, the network has continued to collect specimens in preparation for the winter or for any second wave of COVID-19 cases. We have collected 5404 swabs and detected 623 cases of COVID-19 through extended virological sampling, and 19,341 samples have been collected for serology. This shows our preparedness for the winter season., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a groundswell of general practices joining our network. It has also created a permissive environment in which we have developed the capacity and capability of the national primary care surveillance systems and our unique public health institute, the RCGP and University of Oxford collaboration.

0	Case Report: Myopathy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Consequence of Hyperinflammation?. Introduction: COVID-19-associated muscular complications may comprise myalgia, weakness, wasting, and rhabdomyolysis. Skeletal muscle damage in COVID-19 may be due to direct infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, systemic hyper-inflammatory state with cytokine release and homeostatic perturbation, an autoimmune process, or myotoxic drugs. Disclosing the cause of weakness in an individual patient is therefore difficult. Case Description: We report two patients, who survived typical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment and who developed early on myalgia and severe proximal weakness in all four limbs. Laboratory exams revealed elevated serum creatine kinase and markedly increased C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, concurring with a systemic inflammatory response. On admission in neurorehabilitation (4 and 7 weeks after COVID-19 onset, respectively), the patients presented with proximal flaccid tetraparesis and limb-girdle muscle atrophy. Motor nerve conduction studies showed decreased amplitude and prolonged duration of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal distal motor latencies and normal conduction velocities in median and ulnar nerves. Needle electromyography in proximal muscles revealed spontaneous activity in one and myopathic changes in both patients. Discussion: Clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic findings in these patients were unequivocally consistent with myopathy. Interestingly, increased distal CMAP duration has been described in patients with critical illness myopathy (CIM) and reflects slow muscle fiber conduction velocity due to membrane hypo-excitability, possibly induced by inflammatory cytokines. By analogy with CIM, the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related myopathy might also depend on hyperinflammation and metabolic pathways that may affect muscles in a pathophysiological continuum from hypo-excitability to necrosis.

0	Evaluating the plausible application of advanced machine learnings in exploring determinant factors of present pandemic: A case for continent specific COVID-19 analysis. Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

0	NK Cell Subpopulations and Receptor Expression in Recovering SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Whereas in most cases COVID-19 is asymptomatic or pauci symptomatic, extremely severe clinical forms are observed. In this case complex immune dysregulations and an excessive inflammatory response are observed and are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Natural Killer cells are key players in the control of viral infection and their activity is regulated by a tight balance between activating and inhibitory receptors; an alteration of NK activity was suggested to be associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. In this study we analyzed peripheral NK cell subpopulations and the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in 30 in-patients suffering from chronic neurological conditions who recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing the results to those of 10 patients SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients. Results showed that an expansion of NK subset with lower cytolytic activity and an augmented expression of the 2DL1 inhibitory receptor, particularly when in association with the C2 ligand (KIR2DL1-C2), characterized the immunological scenario of severe COVID-19 infection; an increase of NK expressing the ILT2 inhibitory receptor was instead seen in patients recovering from mild or moderate infection compared to controls. Results herein suggest that the KIR2DL1-C2 NK inhibitory complex is a risk factor toward the development of severe form of COVID-19. Our results confirm that a complex alteration of NK activity is present in COVID-19 infection and offer a molecular explanation for this observation.	false

0	Managing Multimorbidity (Multiple Chronic Diseases) Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: A Community Based Study From Odisha, India. While most of the studies to date demonstrate the deleterious effect of multiple chronic diseases on COVID-19 risk and outcome, there is sparse information available on the effect of the pandemic on multimorbidity management, with no reports yet from India. We sought to explore the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on routine and emergency care for multimorbidity among community-dwelling adults in Odisha, India. A community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken pandemic lockdown, in Khurda district of Odisha, India. Around 600 individuals having at least one chronic disease residing in rural, urban residential and slums were interviewed using a specifically developed questionnaire MAQ COVID-19. The association of socio-demographic characteristics and multimorbidity with pandemic-related care challenges was examined by multiple logistic regression. Principal Component Analysis was employed to minimize the dimensionality of factors related to multimorbidity care. Multimorbidity was highly prevalent in younger age group (46-60 years) with cardio-metabolic clusters being dominant. Individuals with multimorbidity experienced significantly higher care challenges than those with single condition (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.01-2.05) with notable disruption in treatment and routine check-up. Most frequently cited concerns were-physician consultation (43%), diagnostic-services (26%), transport (33%), and mobility restrictions (21%). Multivariate analysis revealed older adults living alone in urban residence to have higher challenges than their rural counterparts. Patient activation for self-care, multimorbidity literacy, and technology-enabled tele-consultation could be explored as potential interventions. Future studies should qualitatively explore the challenges of physicians as well as garner an in-depth understanding of multimorbidity management in the vulnerable subgroups.

0	Pronounce expression of Tim-3 and CD39 but not PD1 defines CD8 T cells in critical Covid-19 patients. Background: During viral infection, inhibitory receptors play a key role in regulating CD8 T-cell activity. The objective of this research was to investigate programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-3 (TIM-3), and CD39 exhaustion markers in CD8 T cells of new coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Method(s): A total of 44 patients with COVID-19 (17 subjects in a critical group and 27 patients in a non-critical group) and 14 healthy controls, who were admitted to Hospitals in Babol, were recruited to the study. In subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we compared the phenotype of CD8 T lymphocytes, expressing PD-1, TIM-3, or CD39, both alone and in various combinations. Result(s): The findings showed that the percentage of CD8+ cells was significantly lower in patients. Critical and non-critical patients were more likely than healthy controls to have an escalated frequency of CD8+ TIM-3+, CD8+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ CD39+ cells. No significant differences were observed between all groups in the CD8+ PD-1+ cell counts. There was also no difference between three groups regarding the counts of CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+, CD8+ PD-1+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD39+ cells. The counts of non-exhausted cells were significantly lower in critical and non-critical individuals compared to the healthy individuals' value. Conclusion(s): Patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), altered exhausted CD8 T lymphocytes with CD39 and TIM-3 exhaustion markers, which may account the dysregulated immune response found in COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Influence of the covid-19 pandemic on dental emergency admissions in an urgent dental care service in North Italy. A retrospective study was performed to verify if the number of admissions for urgent dental care in the Urgent Dental Care Service of San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy) was directly related to the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Different periods were analyzed: March 25-April 5, 2019 (pre-COVID); March 23-April 3, 2020 (lockdown); June 8-June 19, 2020 (reopening); and November 9-November 20 (second wave). Raw data regarding admissions, diagnoses, and treatments were extracted. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. The survey included 901 admissions, 285 in pre-COVID, 93 during lockdown, 353 in reopening, and 170 in the second wave. In each time period, statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of each kind of diagnoses (X2(3) = 20.33 p = 0.01 for endodontic emergencies, X2(3) = 29.05 p < 0.01 for cellulitis/phlegmon, X2(3) = 28.55 p < 0.01 for periodontal emergencies, Fisher's Exact Test p < 0.01 for trauma, and X2(3) = 59.94 p < 0.01 for all other kinds of diagnosis). A remarkable increase in consultations (+186.36%) and other treatments (+90.63%) occurred during reopening. Tooth extraction was the most frequently delivered treatment, but suffered the largest reduction during lockdown (-79.82%). The COVID-19 pandemic has highly affected dental activity in north Italy, underling the weaknesses of a private dental system in a pandemic scenario.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

0	"Cortisol and COVID-19-Putting Undue Stress on the ""Stress Hormone"". Serum cortisol is a measure of underlying disease severity. The more severe the disease, the higher the circulating cortisol levels and the greater the chances of poor prognosis/mortality. Not surprisingly, a recent study found that higher serum cortisol was associated with poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, the study did not take into consideration the confounding effect of COVID-19 severity; hence, the results could not be regarded as being fully adjusted. Besides, guiding glucocorticoid therapy based on serum cortisol levels is an impractical proposition, and to date is not backed by robust evidence.

The objective of this study was to detect the role of the proposed anti-virus drugs EGYPTONA and EGYPTOVA in controlling the COVID-19 and VOC 20 2012/01 life cycles in human blood. Some derivatives of neuraminic acid that liked to glycoproteins on the surface of RBCs are the common factor for facilitating infection with COVID-19 in all its strains, but the original strain is dependent on the presence of furin protease as a receptor for the virus more than the other receptors. The patient that has flu symptoms should be checked the level of iron in his blood, such as ""serum ferritin"" and ""serum transferrin to choose the proposed anti-virus drug EGYPTONA or EGYPTOVA. When the level of iron in the blood is higher than the normal level in patients with COVID-19, the proposed anti-virus drug EGYPTONA would be treating most of the disease symptoms. Likewise, the proposed anti-virus drug EGYPTOVA would be suitable in presence of normal iron levels or anemia to treat patients with VOC 20 2012/01.Copyright © 2021, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among infected healthcare workers. There are only few data concerning persistence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) among SARS-CoV-2-infected healthcare workers (HCW). These individuals are particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and at potential risk of reinfection. We followed 26 HCW with mild COVID-19 three weeks (D21), two months (M2) and three months (M3) after the onset of symptoms. All the HCW had anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA at D21, decreasing to 38.5% at M3 (p < 0.0001). Concomitantly a significant decrease in NAb titers was observed between D21 and M2 (p = 0.03) and between D21 and M3 (p < 0.0001). Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 can elicit a NAb response correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. However, this neutralizing activity declines, and may even be lost, in association with a decrease in systemic IgA antibody levels, from two months after disease onset. This short-lasting humoral protection supports strong recommendations to maintain infection prevention and control measures in HCW, and suggests that periodic boosts of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be required.	false
0	Evaluation of four commercial, fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests suggests a revision of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Objectives: Serological tests detect antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance., Methods: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients)., Results: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results., Conclusions: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the company's newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay for follow-up studies. A combination of tests could be considered in clinical practice.	false
0	Analysis of Humoral Immune Responses in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection. Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a pandemic with tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. In the current study, humoral immune responses were characterized in a cohort of 143 patients with COVID-19 from the University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Method(s): SARS-CoV-2-specific-antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Result(s): The severity of COVID-19 increased with age, and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than female patients. Disease severity was correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after polymerase chain reaction conformation of the infection, and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike protein-directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID-19 disease severity seemed to be correlated with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. Conclusion(s): The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition. Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and are a major contributor to neutralizing antibody responses elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.	false
0	Performance of three SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, three rapid lateral flow tests and a novel bead-based affinity surrogate test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum. For the control of immunity in COVID-19 survivors and vaccinated subjects there is an urgent need for reliable and rapid serological assays. Based on samples from 63 COVID-19 survivors up to seven months after symptom onset, and on 50 serum samples taken before the beginning of the pandemic, we compared the performance of three commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgA/IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, and SERION ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG) and three rapid lateral flow (immunochromatographic) tests (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM, NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM, and Cleartest Corona 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM) with a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) representing the gold standard. In addition, we report and validate a novel, non-commercial flow cytometry bead-based surrogate test. 57 out of 63 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (90 %) showed neutralizing antibodies. The sensitivity of the seven assays ranged from 7.0 % to 98.3 %, the specificity from 86.0 % to 100.00 %. Only one commercial immunoassay showed a sensitivity and specificity of greater than 98 %. These data indicate abundant interassay variability.	false
0	A founder effect led early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Spain. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) whole-genome analysis has identified five large clades worldwide which emerged in 2019 (19A and 19B) and in 2020 (20A, 20B, and 20C). This study aimed to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated to have emerged in Wuhan, China, around 24 November 2019. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 12,511 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences obtained worldwide, including 290 from 11 different regions of Spain, revealed 62 independent introductions of the virus in the country. Most sequences from Spain were distributed in clades characterized by a D614G substitution in the S gene (20A, 20B, and 20C) and an L84S substitution in ORF8 (19B) with 163 and 118 sequences, respectively, with the remaining sequences branching in 19A. A total of 110 (38%) sequences from Spain grouped in four different monophyletic clusters of clade 20A (20A-Sp1 and 20A-Sp2) and 19B clade (19B-Sp1 and 19B-Sp2) along with sequences from 29 countries worldwide. The MRCAs of clusters 19A-Sp1, 20A-Sp1, 19A-Sp2, and 20A-Sp2 were estimated to have occurred in Spain around 21 and 29 January and 6 and 17 February 2020, respectively. The prevalence of clade 19B in Spain (40%) was by far higher than in any other European country during the first weeks of the epidemic, probably as a result of a founder effect. However, this variant was replaced by G614-bearing viruses in April. In vitro assays showed an enhanced infectivity of pseudotyped virions displaying the G614 substitution compared with those having D614, suggesting a fitness advantage of D614G. IMPORTANCE Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain, and at least four resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters that originated not later than mid-February, with further dissemination to many other countries around the world, and a few weeks before the explosion of COVID-19 cases detected in Spain during the first week of March. The majority of the earliest variants detected in Spain branched in the clade 19B (D614 viruses), which was the most prevalent clade during the first weeks of March, pointing to a founder effect. However, from mid-March to June 2020, G614-bearing viruses (clades 20A, 20B, and 20C) overcame D614 variants in Spain, probably as a consequence of an evolutionary advantage of this substitution in the spike protein. A higher infectivity of G614-bearing viruses than D614 variants was detected, suggesting that this substitution in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be behind the variant shift observed in Spain.Copyright © 2021 Diez-Fuertes et al.

0	The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID-19: estimation based on a virtual case. Background: Recently, low dose radiotherapy delivered to the whole lung has been proposed as treatment for the pneumonia due to COVID-19. Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease. Method(s): Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy-1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable. Result(s): The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose <=0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID. Conclusion(s): A RT dose <=0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (<=1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses <=0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.	false
0	Neurological symptoms as a clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019: Implications for internists. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have proven that the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a tropism for the nervous system. The infection of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 can occur via the nasal route through trans-synaptic pathways. Coronaviruses can infect neurons and glial cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors or by endocytosis. The infection of the central nervous system accompanied by coronavirus disease 2019-related systemic inflamma- tion leads to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier and triggers a neuroinflammatory response with reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. In addition, brain stem cells are being damaged, which results in respiratory distress. Apart from typical symptoms of COVID-19 associated with the involvement of the respiratory system, neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we focused on the currently known neu- rological manifestations of COVID-19, which could be considered mainly in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 and, if noted, may limit the transmission of coronavirus infection.Copyright by the Author(s), 2021	false
0	Clinical Features of Patients who had two COVID-19 Episodes: A European Multicenter Case-series. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of patients who had two demonstrated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) episodes. METHOD(S): Data of patients with both COVID-19 episodes were recruited from March 22 to December 27, 2020. The following outcomes were studied: epidemiological, comorbidities, prevalence and severity of general and otolaryngological symptom, olfactory, aroma and gustatory dysfunctions. A comparison between first and second episodes was performed. RESULT(S): Forty-five patients reported having two confirmed COVID-19 episodes. The majority of patients had mild infections in both episodes. The second clinical episode was significantly similar to the first. The symptom duration of the second episode was shorter than the first. The occurrence of loss of smell was unpredictable from the first to the second episode. CONCLUSION(S): The recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms is associated with a similar clinical picture than the first episode in patients with initial mild-to-moderate COVID episode. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of second episode remain uncertain and may involve either true reinfection or virus reactivation from sanctuaries.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Audit of early use of virtual clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic at a district general hospital and its implications for future practice. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how healthcare is delivered, with an emphasis on using technology to minimize hospital visits. In the dermatology department of a district general hospital, we describe our early experience of replacing faceto-face consultations with video or telephone consultations in response to COVID-19, including facilities for patients to email photographs. Alongside this major change, our patient cohort presents additional challenges with a high incidence of skin cancer, and an elderly population who may be less confident using technology (http://www.ncin.org.uk/skin/laua/at las.html). Data were collected over 43 days during May-July 2020 for nonsurgical appointments. Two hundred and eightyfour appointments were recorded. Average age was 55.5 years (range 0-97). Nineteen (6.7%) appointments did not go ahead; 18 did not answer and one was a prisoner for whom necessary preparations were not arranged. Of these, 13 were rebooked, five were discharged and one was booked for surgery based on photos. Of the appointments that proceeded, 210 (79.2%) used telephone only, 37 (14.0%) used video only, 15 (5.7%) used a combination and three (1.1%) were face to face. Reasons cited for not using video included 55 (25.8%) instances telephone deemed sufficient, 50 (23.5%) patients not ready on video software at appointment time, 38 (17.8%) not internet savvy, eight (3.8%) had not received the instruction letter, six (2.8%) had technical issues, three (1.4%) requested telephone consultation and two (0.9%) requested a face-to-face instruction. In the remaining 51 (23.9%), no reason was documented. For patients aged >= 65 years, 18 of 127 appointments (14.2%) proceeded by video vs. 27 of 155 (17.4%) in those aged <= 65 years. Ninety-seven (36.6%) patients emailed photos beforehand and 48 (18.1%) were asked to provide photos afterwards. One hundred and nineteen (44.9%) virtual consultations avoided hospital visits; 43 patients were discharged and 76 had routine follow-up arranged. The data shows that, despite initial difficulty implementing, virtual clinics provide significant potential for reducing hospital visits. Elderly patients were less likely to achieve successful video calls and may benefit from focused support. It was noted anecdotally that patients receiving preparatory phone calls from administrative staff to explain the software had a higher uptake of video consultations. Going forwards, we plan to reaudit, evaluating the impact of administrative staff routinely contacting patients prior to appointments. In the long term, although virtual consultations cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations, this may become an increasingly utilized option reflecting patient choice.	false
0	Influence of age and gender on the epidemic of COVID-19: Evidence from 177 countries and territories-an exploratory, ecological study. Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide with an uncertain ultimate impact on every aspect of human society. Recognizing the groups with higher susceptibility and fatality are in urgent need. Method(s): We retrieved the total number of confirmed incident and death cases of COVID-19 in 177 countries/territories from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Data of age and gender composition were collected from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore the association between the composition of age and gender and the incidence rate (IRC), case fatality rate (CFRC), and mortality rate of COVID-19 (MRC). Multiple comparisons were adjusted by the Bonferroni method, and the threshold p-value was set as p<0.01. Software SPSS 23.0, ArcGIS 10.6, and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used to generate our results. Result(s): Median age was positively correlated to IRC, CFRC and MRC (rs= 0.60; rs= 0.27; rs= 0.61, p<0.0001 for all). The age-dependent correlation between people over 65 years of age with IRC was higher in females, while the correlation between age distribution and CFRC as well as MRC was higher in males (p<0.0001 for all). Besides, we found the age-gender-dependent differences were correlated to IRC in places with high income and associated with CFRC in non-high income countries/territories. Conclusion(s): The correlation between the composition of age and gender and the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 confirmed previous points that females are more susceptible to COVID-19. The results remind us that more attention should be paid to male patients, particularly those over 65 years old for enhanced clinical management.Copyright © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Versus Influenza-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Requiring Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support. No study has compared patients with COVID-19-related refractory ARDS requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) to a relevant and homogenous control population. We aimed to compare the outcomes, the clinical characteristics, and the adverse effects of COVID-19 patients to a retrospective cohort of influenza patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted in the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals between January 2014 and May 2020. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS requiring V-V ECMO infected with either COVID-19 (n=30) or influenza (n=22) were compared. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients. Median age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p=0.62). The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p=0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge, and 3-month survival. COVID-19 patients had a lower SAPS II score (58 [37-64] vs. 68 [52-83]; p=0.039), a higher body mass index (33 [29-38] vs. 30 [26-34] kg/m2; p=0.05), and were cannulated later (median delay between mechanical support and V-V ECMO 6 vs. 3 days, p=0.004) compared with influenza patients. No difference in overall adverse events was observed between COVID-19 and influenza patients (70% vs. 95.5% respectively; p=0.23). Despite differences in clinical presentation before V-V ECMO implantation, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support.Copyright © ASAIO 2020.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 on rheumatology patients in a large UK centre using an innovative data collection technique: prevalence and effect of social shielding. OBJECTIVES: We sought to gain insight into the prevalence of COVID-19 and the impact stringent social distancing (shielding) has had on a large cohort of rheumatology (RD) follow-up patients from a single large UK centre., METHODS: We linked COVID-19-related deaths, screening and infection rates to our RD population (1.2.20-1.5.20) and audited active rheumatology follow-up patients through survey data communicated via a linked mobile phone SMS message. We assessed epidemiology, effect of stringent social distancing (shielding) and quality of life (HRQoL) by Short Form 12 (SF12)., RESULTS: There were 10,387 active follow-up patients, 7911 had linked mobile numbers. 12/10,387 RD patients died from COVID-19 (0.12%); local population 4131/7,415,149 (0.12%). For patients with mobile phones, 1693/7911 (21%) responded and of these, 1605 completed the SF12. Inflammatory arthritis predominated 1174/1693 (69%); 792/1693 (47%) were shielding. Advice on shielding/distancing was followed by 1372/1693(81%). 61/1693 (4%) reported COVID-19 (24/61 shielding); medication distribution was similar in COVID and non-COVID patients. Mental SF12 (MCS) but not physical (PCS) component scores were lower in COVID (60) vs. non-COVID (1545), mean differences: MCS, - 3.3; 95% CI - 5.2 to - 1.4, P < 0.001; PCS, - 0.4; 95% CI, - 2.1 to 1.3). In 1545 COVID-negative patients, those shielding had lower MCS (- 2.1; 95% CI - 2.8 to - 1.4) and PCS (- 3.1, 95% CI - 3.7 to - 2.5), both P < 0.001., CONCLUSIONS: Our full RD cohort had no excess of COVID deaths compared to the general local population. Our survey data suggest that shielding adversely affects both mental and physical health in RD. These data broaden our understanding of shielding, indicating need for further study.	false
0	Susceptibility of the patients infected with Sars-Cov2 to oxidative stress and possible interplay with severity of the disease. Several recent reviews have suggested a role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but its interplay with disease severity has not been revealed yet. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between the severity of COVID-19 and oxidative stress parameters. Clinical data of 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital were analyzed and divided into moderate (n = 44) and severe (n = 33) groups based on their clinical condition. Production of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and defense antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione s-transferase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and sulfhydryl) were assessed using the serum samples. The results revealed that severe patients who presented high serum leukocyte count and CRP level stayed for a longer period in the hospital. However, there was no correlation observed between the oxidative stress parameters and degree of COVID-19 severity in the present study. In conclusion, these results indicate that the disease severity may not be a detrimental factor contributing to the changes in the redox profile of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	780 Variations in telehealth use for prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic at one hospital system. Objective: To assess differences in frequency and types of telehealth use between prenatal care specialty and provider type during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: This was a web-based survey of prenatal care providers at one academic health care system in North Carolina from July 14 to September 15, 2020. Providers practiced in the following specialties: general obstetrics/gynecology, maternal fetal medicine (MFM) and genetics, family medicine, nurse midwifery, and psychiatry. Provider types included physicians, midwives, advanced practitioners, and genetic counselors. The survey was designed to assess prior and current use, satisfaction, and anticipated future needs. Validated tools assessing provider satisfaction were used. The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was defined as March 15, 2020 in order to encompass restrictions on in-person patient care. Descriptive statistics were performed in Stata 15 and responses were stratified both by specialty and provider type. Result(s): 235 providers were surveyed and 116 participated (response rate: 50%). Respondents included: general Ob/Gyn (30%), MFM/genetics (25%), family medicine (34%), midwifery (7%), and perinatal psychiatry (2%). Approximately 16% of respondents reported that they had used telehealth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic while 84% used telehealth during the pandemic. MFM providers conducted significantly more telehealth visits compared to other providers, with 11/29 (38%) of MFM providers reporting greater than 20 telehealth visits per week (p<0.001). The most commonly used telehealth modalities among all respondents were billable telephone and virtual video visits (72% and 76%, respectively). There was no significant difference in modality of telehealth use by specialty or provider type (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Prenatal care via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in one academic medical center increased amongst providers although there were no differences in the modalities used by provider type. With telehealth becoming increasingly prevalent, this analysis provides insight into how emerging technologies for health care delivery are being utilized.

0	Long-Term Evaluation of Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Patients with COVID-19. Background: The role of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in COVID-19 coagulopathy remains controversial; moreover, follow-up data after &amp;gt;12 weeks are lacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: In this prospective single-centre study, we determined &lsquo;criteria&rsquo; (IgG, IgM) and &lsquo;non-criteria&rsquo; (IgA) anti&ndash;&beta;2-glycoprotein I (anti-&beta;2-GPI), and anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, as well as lupus anticoagulant (LAC) in 157 consecutive adult inpatients with COVID-19. Repeat testing was offered after &amp;gt;12 weeks to all patients with initially positive results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Patients had a median age of 69 years, and 38&middot;9% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). LAC was present in 35&middot;6%, aCL in 12&middot;5%, and anti-&beta;2-GPI in 15&middot;6% of the patients, respectively. The most commonly detected isotype was IgA (17&middot;1%), followed by IgM (5&middot;9%), and IgG (2&middot;6%). Occurrence of LAC and/or aPL was observed in 73 (48&middot;7%) patients and was associated with ICU treatment and higher C-reactive protein (p=0&middot;009, and p=0&middot;019 respectively), but not with thromboembolic events (p=0&middot;130) when compared to the aPL-negative population. Patients with IgA double-positivity showed an increased 30-days mortality (75&middot;0% vs 95&middot;1%; p=0&middot;001). Of the 73 patients with positivity for LAC and/or aPL, 38 (52&middot;1%) patients were available for follow-up after &amp;gt;12 weeks. The median LAC ratio decreased from 1&middot;30 (1&middot;22-1&middot;37) at first timepoint to 1&middot;15 (1&middot;10-1&middot;25) (p=0&middot;001) at follow-up, while aPL positivity remained unchanged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: aPL are a transient phenomenon in COVID-19 most likely related to &lsquo;non-criteria&rsquo; antibodies and inflammation and are associated with disease severity, but not with macrothrombotic events.

0	Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is one of the worst catastrophic events in human history. Several non-specific antiviral drugs have been tried to defeat the SARS-CoV-2, with mixed results. Convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 is one of the specific biologic therapies being considered to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preliminary studies have shown that convalescent plasma, containing antibodies able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, is promising in blocking viral replication and improving patients' clinical symptoms. The results of several ongoing randomized controlled trials are, however, keenly awaited to definitively elucidate the safety and efficacy of this blood component in COVID-19. In this narrative review, we summarize the current evidence from the literature on the treatment of severe COVID-19 with convalescent plasma. A concise overview of the hypothesized mechanisms of action is also presented. Copyright © 2021 Franchini and Liumbruno.	false

Sentinel animals remain a common means of evaluating rodent health in research colonies. An evaluation of our sentinelprogram revealed that using Crl:CD1(ICR)-Elite (CD1-E) mice was expensive, occasionally disrupted by limited supply, andminimally responsive to the 3Rs. This evaluation prompted us to explore the use of CRL:NU-Foxn1nu/+ (Het-nude) mice assoiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) animals. Het-nude mice are a byproduct of breeding outbred athymic nude mice and are reared in isolators, with similar health status as CD1-E. Het-nude mice have a thymus, but may have smaller thymic size and fewer bone marrow stem cells than do wildtype controls, suggesting that Het-nude mice might not be immunologically normal.This study compared the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of Het-nude and CD1-E SBS to murine norovirus (MNV)and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Het-nude and CD1-E female SBS (n = 22 mice of each stock) were housed continuously on soiled bedding collected from MNV-positive or MNV- and MHV-positive colonies at cage changes. Blood was collected for serology at 3, 9 and 12 to 19 wk after the start of soiled bedding exposure. Antibody titers to MNV or MHV did not differ significantly between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. A significant relationship was found between weeks of exposure and titer levels with an increase in titer over the testing period. This study supports the possible use of Het-nude mice as SBS, giventhat their antibody responses to MNV and MHV are equivalent to those of CD1-E mice.	false
0	Vaccination Against Influenza Among Lebanese Health Care Workers in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . <h4>Background: </h4> Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of influenza infection. Hence, the rationale for immunization to protect them and their patients particularly during the co-circulation of influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices among HCWs towards the influenza vaccine and to identify the determinants of their willingness to vaccinate. <h4>Methods: </h4> Using an online survey, a cross-sectional study, was conducted in Lebanon between 14th and 28th October 2020 among HCWs. Descriptive statistics were reported using frequency and percentages for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to identify the factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Adjusted odds ratio and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. <h4>Results: </h4>: A total of 560 HCWs participated in the survey of which 72.9% were females. The majority were nurses (63.2%), married (66.1%) and aged between 30-49 years (53.9%). Nearly half of them had a good level of knowledge (≥80%). As perceived by HCWs, the availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine will be the biggest challenge. Benefits of vaccination in enhancing patient safety, and avoiding co-infection by influenza and COVID-19 were well-acknowledged by HCWs. 32.1% of HCWs have received the influenza vaccine during the last year and 80.2% were willing to vaccinate for the current year. The influenza uptake was higher among HCWs who have received influenza vaccine in the past season (OR = 6.812, CI (3.045-15.239)), having a fair health status (OR = 3.117, CI (1.345-7.220)), good knowledge (OR=3.305, CI (1.155-9.457)), positive attitude (OR=2.305, CI (0.921-5.571)), low perception of barriers (OR= 4.130, CI (1.827-9.334)) and high perception of benefits (OR=6.264, CI (2.919-13.442) and was lower in single and divorced (OR=0.527, CI (0.284-0.978)). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Addressing misconceptions unveiled in this study through adapted training, along with economic interventions are needed to improve influenza vaccination coverage among HCWs.	false
0	COVID-19 and the kidneys, implications and outcomes. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared as a pandemic has affected millions of people and caused unprecedented number of death. The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b-9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources. Risk of AKI and death is also increased among kidney recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2021, Iranian Society of Nephrology. All rights reserved.	false
0	The relationship between serum erythropoietin, hepcidin, and haptoglobin levels with disease severity and other biochemical values in patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that iron metabolism is affected by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which has spread worldwide and has become a global health problem. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and serum erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, and haptoglobin (Hpt) levels with disease severity, and other biochemical values., METHODS: Fifty nine COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and wards in our hospital between March and June 2020 and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Participants were divided into mild, severe, and critical disease severity groups. Group mean values were analyzed with SPSS according to disease severity, mortality, and intubation status., RESULTS: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in the critical patient group (P < .0001) and deceased group (P < .0001). The red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and ferritin values were significantly higher in the intubated (P = .001, P = .005) and deceased (P = .014, P = .003) groups. Ferritin values were positively correlated with disease severity (P < .0001). Serum iron levels were lower in the patient group compared with the reference range. (P < .0001). It was found that the transferrin saturation (TfSat) was lower in the patient group compared with the control group (P < .0001). It was found that the mean EPO of the deceased was lower than the control group and the survived patient group (P = .035). Hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P < .0001). Hpt values were found to be significantly lower in the intubated group (P = .004) and the deceased group (P = .042)., CONCLUSION: In our study, while serum iron and hepcidin levels decreased in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we found that EPO and Hpt levels were significantly lower in critical and deceased patient groups. Our study is the first study examining EPO and Hpt levels in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Toward the understanding of national culture in the success of non-pharmaceutical technological interventions in mitigating COVID-19 pandemic. This study conceptually explores the relationship between a nation's culture and the success of utilizing various digital technologies to mitigate the spread of a pandemic, such as novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In the absence of a cure or vaccine of COVID-19, the national governments and public health authorities have been aggressively utilizing digital technologies to mitigate the pandemic spread. Given the urgency caused by COVID-19, this study highlights the importance of considering a country's national culture in evaluating the efficacy of a given digital technology, despite how promising or groundbreaking it may sound, in combating the spread of an infectious disease. Relying on the two critical dimensions of national culture, power distance and individualism/collectivism, this study proposes a framework that describes how people from different countries, depending on their prevalent national cultural values, would be receptive (or intolerant) to using government-run technology solutions meant for curbing the pandemic spread.

0	Peptides-based vaccine against SARS-nCoV-2 antigenic fragmented synthetic epitopes recognized by T cell and beta-cell initiation of specific antibodies to fight the infection. The World Health Organization has declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus to be a global pandemic. The FDA is yet to approve a vaccine for human novel coronavirus. Here, we developed a peptide-based vaccine and used high-throughput screening by molecular dynamics simulation to identify T-cell- and beta-cell-recognized epitopes for producing specific antibodies against SARS-nCoV-2. We construct ~ 12 P' antigenic epitope peptides to develop a more effective vaccine and identify specific antibodies. These epitope peptides selectively presented the best antigen presentation scores for both human pMHC class I and II alleles to develop a strong binding affinity. All antigens identified of SARS-nCoV-2 different proteins by each attached specific ~ 1-7 L linker adaptor were used to construct a broad single peripheral peptide vaccine. It is expected to be highly antigenic with a minimum allergic effect. As a result of these exciting outcomes, expressing a vaccine using the intimated peptide was highly promising and positive to be highly proposed as epitope-based peptide vaccine of specific antibody against SARS-nCoV-2 by initiating T cells and beta-cells. An in vitro study for the proposed peptide-based vaccine is mostly recommended. Further clinical trials are required to check the efficacy of this vaccine.

Inflammatory monocytes and macrophages are crucial, promoting injurious, pro-inflammatory sequelae. Immunomodulation is, therefore, an attractive therapeutic strategy and we sought to test licensed and novel candidate drugs. Methods and analysis The CATALYST trial is a multi-arm, open-label, multi-centre, phase II platform trial designed to identify candidate novel treatments to improve outcomes of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with usual care. Treatments with evidence of biomarker improvements will be put forward for larger-scale testing by current national phase III platform trials. Hospitalised patients >16 years with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (confirmed by chest X-ray or CT scan, with or without a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay) and a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) ≥40 mg/L are eligible. The primary outcome measure is CRP, measured serially from admission to day 14, hospital discharge or death. Secondary outcomes include the WHO Clinical Progression Improvement Scale as a principal efficacy assessment. Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the East Midlands - Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee (20/EM/0115) and given Urgent Public Health status; initial approval was received on 05-May-2020, current protocol version (v6.0) approval on 12-Oct-2020. The MHRA also approved all protocol versions. The results of this trial will be disseminated through national and international presentations and peer-reviewed publications.	false

0	Asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019 among healthcare workers in Isfahan, Iran. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Isfahan, Iran. Materials & methods: HCWs in COVID-19 wards of three referral COVID-19 hospitals in Isfahan were screened and tested for COVID-19 infection. Results: In total, 102 HCWs were screened whose median age was 43 years old. Moreover, 21 (20.5%) of them had a history of suspected infection with SARS-CoV2, mostly (66.6%) without any symptoms while six (28.5%) of them suffered from relatively mild diseases and one (4.7%) was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: It was found that HCWs were prone to be asymptomatic carriers while their computed tomography images were normal. Therefore, it is recommended that reverse-transcriptase real-time-PCR be essential for the diagnosis of infections.	false
0	Incidence of venous thromboembolism among patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation compared to other causes of respiratory failure: a prospective cohort study. Previous studies have suggested that COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study aimed to investigate the incidence of VTE among mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to patients with respiratory failure related to other causes. Prospective study that enrolled critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia between June 2, 2020 and August 11, 2020. Critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation within 24 h after hospital admission were followed until death or hospital discharge. Sequential ultrasonography screening of the lower extremities and catheter insertion sites, as well as testing for plasma biochemical markers, were performed at the intensive care unit admission, day 3, day 7, and day 14. The primary outcome was a composite of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis at the central catheter insertion sites. We enrolled 70 patients, including 57 patients with COVID-19 and 13 patients without COVID-19, and all patients completed follow-up. The incidence of the primary outcome was higher among patients with COVID-19 than among patients with respiratory failure related to other etiologies (36.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.023). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that VTE was independently associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio: 6.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-68.07) and D-dimer concentration (1-ng/mL increase, odds ratio: 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.30). The incidence of VTE was higher among critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, relative to among patients with respiratory failure related to other causes.	false
0	"Second versus first wave of COVID-19 deaths: shifts in age distribution and in nursing home fatalities. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths and the share of deaths in nursing homes changed in the second versus the first pandemic wave., ELIGIBLE DATA: We considered all countries that had at least 4000 COVID-19 deaths occurring as of January 14, 2020, at least 200 COVID-19 deaths occurring in each of the two epidemic wave periods; and which had sufficiently detailed information available on the age distribution of these deaths. We also considered countries with data available on COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents for the two waves., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the second wave versus the first wave in the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in people <50 years (""young deaths"") among all COVID-19 deaths and among COVID-19 deaths in people <70 years old; and change in the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in nursing home residents among all COVID-19 deaths., RESULTS: Data on age distribution were available for 14 eligible countries. Individuals <50 years old had small absolute difference in their share of the total COVID-19 deaths in the two waves across 13 high-income countries (absolute differences 0.0-0.4%). Their proportion was higher in Ukraine, but it decreased markedly in the second wave. The odds of young deaths was lower in the second versus the first wave (summary prevalence ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.92) with large between-country heterogeneity. The odds of young deaths among deaths <70 years did not differ significantly across the two waves (summary prevalence ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.06). Eligible data on nursing home COVID-19 deaths were available for 11 countries. The share of COVID-19 deaths that were accounted by nursing home residents decreased in the second wave significantly and substantially in 8 countries (prevalence ratio estimates: 0.36 to 0.78), remained the same in Denmark and Norway and markedly increased in Australia., CONCLUSIONS: In the examined countries, age distribution of COVID-19 deaths has been fairly similar in the second versus the first wave, but the contribution of COVID-19 deaths in nursing home residents to total fatalities has decreased in most countries in the second wave.

0	Variations in respiratory pathogen carriage among a homeless population in a shelter for men in Marseille, France, March-July 2020: cross-sectional 1-day surveys. We aimed to compare respiratory pathogen carriage by PCR during three different time periods in 2020 in sheltered homeless people in Marseille, France. The overall prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage in late March-early April (69.9%) was significantly higher than in late April (42.3%) and mid-July (45.1%). Bacterial carriage significantly decreased between late March-early April and late April. SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in late March-early April samples (20.6%). Measures aiming at mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission were effective and also impacted bacterial carriage. Seasonal variations of bacterial carriage between winter and summer in this population were not marked.	false
0	Clinical Profile, Hospital Course and Outcome of Children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalized children with COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the dedicated COVID-19 hospital of a tertiary care referral center in North India. Consecutive children aged 14 y or younger who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab between 1 April 2020 and 15 July 2020 were included., RESULTS: Of 31 children with median (IQR) age of 33 (9-96) mo, 9 (29%) were infants. About 74% (n = 23) had history of household contact. Comorbidities were noted in 6 (19%) children. More than half (58%) were asymptomatic. Of 13 symptomatic children, median (IQR) duration of symptoms was 2 (1-5.5) d. Fever (32%) was most common followed by cough (19%), rapid breathing (13%), diarrhea (10%) and vomiting (10%). Severe [n = 4, 13%] and critical [n = 1, 3%] illnesses were noted more commonly in infants with comorbidities. Three (10%) children required PICU admission and invasive ventilation; one died. Median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 15 (11-20) d. Follow up RT-PCR before discharge was performed in 17 children and the median (IQR) duration to RT-PCR negativity was 16 (12-19) d., CONCLUSIONS: In the early pandemic, most children with COVID-19 had a household contact and presented with asymptomatic or mild illness. Severe and critical illness were observed in young infants and those with comorbidities.	false
0	Impact of burnout, secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction on hand hygiene of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To assess the prevalence of burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction and explore their impacts on self-reported hand hygiene among medical aid teams in the COVID-19 period in Wuhan, China., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., METHOD: A total of 1,734 healthcare workers from 17 medical aid teams were surveyed. The survey included burnout, secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction measured by the professional quality of life scale and self-reported hand hygiene. Data were collected between 5-7 March 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Burnout and secondary trauma stress were at low and average levels, and compassion satisfaction was at average and high levels. Burnout was negatively associated with hand hygiene, while compassion satisfaction was positively associated. Hospital administrators should pay attention to burnout and compassion satisfaction to improve infection control behaviours. Management of healthcare workers in our study may be constructive in emerging infectious diseases. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Nursing Open published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	COVID-19 Pandemic, CLABSI, and CAUTI: The Urgent Need to Refocus on Hardwiring Prevention Efforts. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a considerable impact on US hospitalizations, affecting processes and patient population., METHODS: We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in 78 US hospitals on central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) events 12 months pre-COVID-19 and 6 months during COVID-19 pandemic., RESULTS: There were 795,022 central line-days and 817,267 urinary catheter-days over the two study periods. Compared to pre-COVID-19 period, CLABSI rates increased during the pandemic period from 0.56 to 0.85 (51.0%) per 1,000 line-days (p<0.001) and from 1.00 to 1.64 (62.9%) per 10,000 patient-days (p<0.001). Hospitals with monthly COVID-19 patients representing >10% of admissions had a NHSN device standardized infection ratio for CLABSI that was 2.38 times higher compared to those with <5% prevalence during the pandemic period (p=0.004). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus CLABSI increased by 130% from 0.07 to 0.17 events per 1,000 line-days (p<0.001), and Candida sp. by 56.9% from 0.14 to 0.21 per 1,000 line-days (p=0.01). In contrast, no significant changes were identified for CAUTI (0.86 vs. 0.77 per 1,000 catheter-days; p=0.19)., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial increases in CLABSI but not CAUTI events. Our findings underscore the importance of hardwiring processes for optimal line care, and regular feedback on performance to maintain a safe environment.	false
0	Assessment of S1, S2 and NCP-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG antibody kinetics in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a microarray and twelve other immunoassays. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed multispecific antibody kinetics of different immunoglobulins in hospitalized patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three-hundred-fifty-four blood samples longitudinally obtained from 81 IgG seroconverting CoVID-19 patients were quantified for spike (S)1, S2, and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)- specific IgM, IgA, IgG, and total Ig antibodies using a microarray, eleven different ELISAs/CLIAs, and one rapid test by seven manufacturers. The assays' specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th-day post symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP, respectively. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.

0	Evaluation of Analytical Performance of Seven Rapid Antigen Detection Kits for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Background: Early diagnosis of the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial to identify infectious individuals and to help prevent the spread of the virus in the community. Several assays have been developed and are in use in today's clinical practice. These assays vary in their analytical and clinical performance. For an accurate diagnosis, medical professionals must become more familiar with the test's utility to select the most appropriate test. This study aims to evaluate the analytical performance of rapid antigen tests used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen compared to RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay., Methods: Oropharyngeal swab specimens from five COVID-19 patients were tested by seven rapid antigen tests developed by different IVD companies. RT-PCR to detect specific RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 was used as a confirmatory test. The cycle threshold (Ct) value, which often reflects viral load, in these specimens ranged from 15 to 35. For the analytical evaluation, extraction fluid of each antigen kit was spiked with attenuated ATCC virus at different concentrations ranging from 4.6x104/mL to 7.5x105/mL and tested with antigen testing kits., Results: Out of five confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens by RT-PCR, only one sample showed a positive result by one of the seven evaluated antigen testing kits. The positive result was observed in the specimen with a Ct value of 15. All other evaluated rapid tests were negative for all five positive specimens. This was further confirmed with the spiking study using ATCC attenuated virus, where extraction fluid of each rapid test was spiked with concentrations ranging from 4.6x104/mL to 7.5x105/mL. None of these spiked specimens showed positive results, indicating very low sensitivity of these antigen kits., Conclusion: This comparison study shows that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR tests and are not reliable tests for testing asymptomatic patients, who often carry low viral load. Analytical performance of rapid antigen tests should be thoroughly evaluated before implementing it at clinical decision level. Copyright © 2021 Eshghifar et al.	false
0	Emerging adults' intersecting experiences of food insecurity, unsafe neighbourhoods and discrimination during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To examine how food insecurity is related to emerging adults' food behaviours and experiences of neighbourhood safety and discrimination and to identify resources needed to support their health during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24.6 (sd 2.0) years, 70.2 % female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULT(S): The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28.4 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 41.0 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19. Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for more food assistance and relief funds. CONCLUSION(S): Food-insecure emerging adults experience many barriers to maintaining healthful eating patterns during COVID-19.	false
0	Risk of SARS-CoV2-related Mortality in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With First-line Immunotherapy Alone or in Combination With Chemotherapy. <h4>Background: </h4> Patients with cancer are vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although the impact of solid cancer types and systemic anticancer treatments on its related mortality is still debatable. <h4>Methods:</h4> To weigh the real impact of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by exploring the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality in a retrospective analysis of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with first-line Pembrolizumab or in combination with chemotherapy (ChT) during the first surge of the pandemic. <h4>Results:</h4> The risk of death was significantly higher in the group of patients treated with ChT+Pembrolizumab than with Pembrolizumab alone (OR 2.43 (1.23-4.82, p=0.01). The SARS-CoV-2-related mortality rate was 8% and significantly associated with ChT+Pembrolizumab as compared to Pembrolizumab alone (18% vs. 0%, respectively, p=0.03). Patients dead because of SARS-CoV-2 were older than 70 years (100 vs. 34%, respectively, p=0.03) and tended to have a heavier smoking history (67 vs. 29% of current smokers, respectively, p=0.17). Higher baseline values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (with 67 vs. 50% ≥ 4.0, p=0.58) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) (with 67 vs. 50% ≥ 1236, p=0.58) were observed in patients dead due to the SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Immunotherapy might not impact the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, whilst the addition of ChT was either associated with an overall increased risk of mortality and to the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. The co-existence of other clinical factors may have contributed to the latter.	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Severe COVID-19 Induced Acute Kidney Injury. Background: The incidence and outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced kidney injury have been variably described. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, correlates and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). Method(s): We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 671 critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China between January 1 to February 29, 2020. Data were captured on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, acute physiology, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary exposure was ICU admission for confirmed COVID-19 related critically illness. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with AKI, organ dysfunction, treatment intensity, and health services use. Measurements and Main Results: Of 671 severe COVID-19 patients (median [IQR] 65 [56-73] years; male sex 65% (n = 434); hypertension 43% (n = 287) and APACHE II score 10 [7-14]), 39% developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, had greater markers of inflammation and coagulation activation, and had greater acuity and organ dysfunction as presentation. Despite similar treatment with antivirals, patients with AKI had lower viral conversion negative rates than those without AKI. The 28-day mortality was much higher in AKI patients than patients without AKI (72% vs. 42%), and there was an increase in 28-day mortality according to the severity of AKI. Non-survivors were less likely to receive antiviral therapy [132 (70%) vs. 65 (88%)] compared with survivors and have lower viral negative conversion rate [17 (9%) vs. 47 (64%)]. Conclusion(s): Acute kidney injury was quite common in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, which associated with higher mortality.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Pathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients: a scoping review. OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic had intense social and economic effects. Patients infected with COVID-19 may present with a series of conditions. A considerable number of patients express taste and smell disturbances as a prodromal, coexistent, or as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The objective of the present review is to review the hypothetical mechanisms of action and etiopathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple scientific databases were explored, including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane-library, LILACS, Livivo and OpenGrey. All types of articles that discussed the pathogenesis of dysgeusia were included, while articles that described dysgeusia without detail about its mode of action were excluded., RESULTS: A total of 47 articles, with different designs, were included in this review. These articles suggested direct viral neural invasion to olfactory and gustatory nerves, viral cytotoxicity to taste buds, angiotensin II imbalance, augmented pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disturbances in salivary glands and sialic acid. COVID-19 induced-dysgeusia was also associated with systemic diseases, medications, zinc, chemicals, and disinfectants., CONCLUSIONS: The most likely cause of transient dysgeusia in COVID-19 is peripheral neurotropism and direct toxicity to taste buds or olfactory epithelium. Other factors may also play a contributory role in dysgeusia, such as a defect in the quality and quantity of saliva, pro-inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin II accumulation, systemic diseases, hypozincemia, and excessive use of chemicals.	false
0	Health outcomes and economic burden of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health outcomes and the economic burden of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States., METHODS: Hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) from April 1 - October 31, 2020 were identified in the Premier Healthcare COVID-19 Database. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, and concomitant medical conditions were assessed. Hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital charges, and hospital costs were evaluated overall and stratified by age groups, insurance types, and 4 COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage., RESULTS: Of the 173,942 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, median age was 63 years, 51.0% were male, and 48.5% were covered by Medicare. The most prevalent concomitant medical conditions were cardiovascular disease (73.5%), hypertension (64.8%), diabetes (40.7%), obesity (27.0%), and chronic kidney disease (24.2%). Approximately one-fifth (21.9%) of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU and 16.9% received IMV; most patients (73.6%) did not require ICU admission or IMV, and 12.4% required both. The median hospital LOS was 5 days, in-hospital mortality was 13.6%, median hospital charges were $43,986, and median hospital costs were $12,046. Hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality increased with ICU and/or IMV usage and age; hospital charges and costs increased with ICU and/or IMV usage. Patients with both ICU and IMV usage had the longest median hospital LOS (15 days), highest in-hospital mortality (53.8%), and highest hospital charges ($198,394) and hospital costs ($54,402)., LIMITATIONS: This retrospective administrative database analysis relied on coding accuracy and a subset of admissions with validated/reconciled hospital costs., CONCLUSIONS: This study summarizes the severe health outcomes and substantial hospital costs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US. The findings support the urgent need for rapid implementation of effective interventions, including safe and efficacious vaccines.	false
0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular mortality and catherization activity during the lockdown in central Germany: an observational study. Aims: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for cardiac care have declined. However, effects on mortality are unclear. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period in central Germany on overall and cardiovascular deaths. Simultaneously we looked at catheterization activities in the same region. Methods and Results: Data from 22 of 24 public health-authorities in central Germany were aggregated during the pandemic related lockdown period and compared to the same time period in 2019. Information on the total number of deaths and causes of death, including cardiovascular mortality, were collected. Additionally, we compared rates of hospitalization (n = 5178) for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 26 hospitals in this area. Data on 5,984 deaths occurring between March 23, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated. In comparison to the reference non-pandemic period in 2019 (deaths: n = 5832), there was a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality of 2.6% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.06; p = 0.16]. Cardiovascular and cardiac mortality increased significantly by 7.6% (IRR 1.08, 95%-CI 1.01-1.14; p = 0.02) and by 11.8% (IRR 1.12, 95%-CI 1.05-1.19; p < 0.001), respectively. During the same period, our data revealed a drop in cardiac catherization procedures. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19-related lockdown a significant increase in cardiovascular mortality was observed in central Germany, whereas catherization activities were reduced. The mechanisms underlying both of these observations should be investigated further in order to better understand the effects of a pandemic-related lockdown and social-distancing restrictions on cardiovascular care and mortality.

0	Evaluation of vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients referred to Labafinejad hospital in Tehran and its relationship with disease severity and mortality. Background and aims: Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) first appeared in China in late 2019 which was rapidly spread worldwide. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, it is crucial to determine the prognostic factors contributing to the development of severe disease and higher mortality. Herein we aimed to evaluate the correlation between the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID 19 with serum 25(OH)D levels. Method(s): This descriptive retrospective study was performed from March to April 2020 at a referral center for patients with COVID-19, Tehran, Iran. The data collection was performed by a checklist consisting of the demographic features and laboratory assessments consisted of serum 25(OH)D were evaluated and recorded. And investigate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and clinical outcomes of patients. Result(s): 205 patients with a mean age of 59.71 years were enrolled. Our findings did not reveal a significant difference in mean levels of vitamin between improved (34.09) and deceased patients (34.54). However, in patients with severe disease, there was a considerable difference in levels of vitamin D in improved and deceased patients (P.value: 0.021). According to our results, the mortality rate was slightly higher in men (odds ratio:2.2). Furthermore, the mean age (64.20 vs. 58.51) and the presence of at least two comorbidities (odds ratio: 2.40) were significantly higher in deceased patients. Conclusion(s): In this study, we did not reveal a statistical difference in mean levels of vitamin D and the outcome of patients with COVID-19. We concluded that in patients with severe disease, vitamin D deficiency could affect the course of the disease and mortality, especially in comorbidity and older people.Copyright © 2021 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism	false
0	"Evaluation of five immunoassays and one lateral flow immunochromatography for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection. INTRODUCTION: In order to deal with the current pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus several serological immunoassays have been recently developed with the objective of being used as a complementary diagnostic tool and to support the RT-PCR technique currently considered the ""gold-standard"" method. However, these new assays need to be evaluated and validated. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays (two ELISA and three CLIA assays) and one rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., METHODS: Five semiquantitative immunoassays (MENARINI R, PALEX R, VIRCLIA R, ROCHE R and SIEMENS R) and one lateral flow rapid test (WONDFO R) were performed. A total of 124 samples were studied. Case serum samples (n=78) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/epidemiological-clinical-radiological criteria, and control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=46) belonged to healthy healthcare workers involved in a seroprevalence study., RESULTS: Overall, the tests showed sensitivities around 70-90% and specificities greater than 95%, including the immunochromatographic test. In addition, we observed very good agreements among them, being better for the detection of IgG than for IgM antibodies (Cohen's kappa index of 0.95 for VIRCLIA R IgG with ROCHE R), as well as good diagnostic power of the tests as determined by the ROC curves., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the proper performance of the different immunoassays in order to be applied in the clinical practice as support in the diagnostic approach and in the development of vaccines and seroepidemiological studies of COVID-19.

0	Inositol and vitamin D may naturally protect human reproduction and women undergoing assisted reproduction from Covid-19 risk. In late 2019, the new Coronavirus has been identified in the city of Wuhan then COVID-19 spreads like wildfire in the rest of the world. Pregnant women represent a risk category for increased abortion rates and vertical transmission with adverse events on the newborns has been recently confirmed. The scientific world is struggling for finding an effective cure for counteracting symptomatology. Today, there are many therapeutic proposes but none of them can effectively counteract the infection. Moreover, many of these compounds show important side effects not justifying their use. Scientific literature reports an immune system over-reaction through interleukins-6 activation. In this regard, the possibility to control the immune system represents a possible strategy for counteracting the onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. Vitamin D deficiency shows increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections. Moreover, Vitamin D seems involved in host protection from different virus species by modulating activation and release of cytokines. Myo-inositol down-regulates the expression of IL-6 by phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Furthermore, myo-inositol is the precursor of phospholipids in the surfactant and it is applied for inducing surfactant synthesis in infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This review aims to summarize the evidence about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to encourage the scientific community to investigate the use of Vitamin D and Myo-inositol which could represent a possible preventive treatment for pregnant women or women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Side-Effects of Public Health Policies Against COVID-19: The Story of an Over-Reaction. Let us all take a moment to talk, once again, about this new coronavirus pandemic that the world has been facing since November 2019 and about its global response. After a short period marked by the pandemic underestimation risk by most governments, the Western world went nuts and overreacted, most probably so as not to be accused of inaction. In many cases, the overall benefits of the chosen policies were not sufficiently questioned, which resulted in many side effects on global health .The medical motto &ldquo;primum non nocere&rdquo;, a moral principle everyone should at least consider following, was evidently not taken into account. It has been overlooked, and the virus has become an obsession, to the extent that nearly everything else, even the most valuable things in life, is still now under appreciated if not simply ignored. This review highlighted facts against this simplistic, one-dimensional view.	false
0	A survey of anxiety and burnout in the radiology workforce of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION: We aimed to study anxiety and burnout among Division of Radiological Sciences (RADSC) staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential risk and protective factors. These outcomes were compared with non-RADSC staff., METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted between 12 March and 20 July 2020 in the largest public tertiary hospital receiving COVID-19 cases. Burnout and anxiety were assessed with the Physician Work-Life Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, respectively. Workplace factors were examined as potential risk and protective factors using multivariable ordinary least squares regression analyses, adjusting for pertinent demographic characteristics., RESULTS: RADSC staff (n = 180) and non-RADSC staff (n = 1458) demonstrated moderate-to-severe anxiety rates of 6.7 and 13.2 % and burnout rates of 17.8 and 23.9 %, respectively. RADSC staff reported significantly lower anxiety (mean +/- SD: 4.0 +/- 3.7 vs 4.9 +/- 4.5; P-value < 0.05), burnout (mean +/- SD: 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs 2.1 +/- 0.8; P-value < 0.01), increased teamwork (82.2% vs 74.1%; P-value < 0.05) and fewer night shifts (36.7% vs 41.1%; P-value < 0.01). Among RADSC staff, higher job dedication was associated with lower anxiety (b (95% CI) = -0.28 (-0.45, -0.11)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = -0.07 (-0.11,-0.04)), while longer than usual working hours was associated with increased anxiety (b (95% CI) = 1.42 (0.36, 2.45)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = 0.28 (0.09, 0.48))., CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of RADSC staff reported significant burnout and anxiety, although less compared to the larger hospital cohort. Measures to prevent longer than usual work hours and increase feelings of enthusiasm and pride in one's job may further reduce the prevalence of anxiety problems and burnout in radiology departments.

0	Psychological responses to COVID-19 in a Mexican population: an exploratory study during second and third phases. This work constitutes an exploratory study during the second and third phases of COVID-19 in Mexico, characterized by local transmission and untraceable cases, respectively, with an incidental sample of 666 participants. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale was used to assess depression, anxiety and stress associated to COVID-19. Additionally, the Impact of the Event Scale-Revised was applied to assess the impact of the event, and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was employed to assess resilience. Participants ' levels of traumatic impact (21.7%), severe depression (7%), severe anxiety (9.4%) and severe stress (5.4%) were revealed to be lower than other populations. Comparison of means and effect size eta2 p of the data shows that women and young people (18-39 years) suffer the greatest negative effects. Individuals with higher levels of resilience experience fewer psychological consequences confirming its importance in the face of the adversities. These findings provide valuable information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Mexican population, allowing a comparative analysis at an international level which can be helpful in the development of appropriate sanitary policies.	false
0	COVID-19 and the Heart: A Systematic Review of Cardiac Autopsies. Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated cardiac injury has been postulated secondary to several mechanisms. While tissue diagnosis is limited during the acute illness, postmortem studies can help boost our understanding and guide management. Objective: To report the cardiac tissue autopsy findings in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) decedents. Evidence Review: Articles published in PubMed and Embase reporting postmortem cardiac pathology of COVID-19 decedents till September 2020. We included adult studies excluding preprints. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports was used to assess quality. We extracted gross and histology data as well as the incidence of myocarditis, cardiac ischemia, thrombosis, and dilatation. We also looked at the reported cause of death (PROSPERO registration CRD42020190898). Findings: Forty-one relevant studies identified including 316 cases. The deceased were mostly male (62%) and elderly (median age, 75; range, 22-97 years). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (48%) and coronary artery disease (33%). Cardiac pathologies contributed to the death of 15 cases. Besides chronic cardiac pathologies, postmortem examination demonstrated cardiac dilatation (20%), acute ischemia (8%), intracardiac thrombi (2.5%), pericardial effusion (2.5%), and myocarditis (1.5%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected within the myocardium of 47% of studied hearts. Conclusions and Relevance: SARS-CoV-2 can invade the heart, but a minority of cases were found to have myocarditis. Cardiac dilatation, ischemia, mural, and microthrombi were the most frequent findings. The systematic review was limited by the small number of cases and the quality of the studies, and there is a need to standardize the cardiac postmortem protocols.

0	Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 can be unknown carriers magnifying the transmission of COVID-19. This study appraised the frequency of asymptomatic individuals and estimated occurrence by age group and gender by reviewing the existing published data on asymptomatic people with COVID-19. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS), were used to search the literature following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The study population for this review included asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in original articles published up to 30 April 2020. A random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases among all COVID-19 patients and also by age and gender. From the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the pooled prevalence according to the random effect size of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30-67%). Of the asymptomatic cases, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6-66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5-79.1%) were children. Children and females were more likely to present as asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and could act as unknown carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom-based screening might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections escalating the threat of global spread and impeding containment. Therefore, a mass surveillance system to track asymptomatic cases is critical, with special attention to females and children.	false
0	Physical exercise as a tool to help the immune system against COVID-19: an integrative review of the current literature. Acute viral respiratory infections are the main infectious disease in the world. In 2020, a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global pandemic. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as genetics, age and physical state, and its main input receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases. Thus, regular practice of adequate intensity is suggested as an auxiliary tool in strengthening and preparing the immune system for COVID-19. Further studies are needed to associate physical exercise with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 on in-hospital cardiac arrest: incidence, causes, and outcome - a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an emerging virus, has caused a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to high hospitalization rates worldwide. Little is known about the occurrence of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and high mortality rates have been proposed. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, characteristics and outcome of IHCA during the pandemic in comparison to an earlier period., METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively recorded during 3-month-periods 2019 and 2020 at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). All consecutive adult patients with IHCA were included. Clinical parameters, neurological outcomes and organ failure/support were assessed., RESULTS: During the study period hospital admissions declined from 18,262 (2019) to 13,994 (2020) (- 23%). The IHCA incidence increased from 4.6 (2019: 84 IHCA cases) to 6.6 (2020: 93 IHCA cases)/1000 hospital admissions. Median stay before IHCA was 4 (1-9) days. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both periods. IHCA location shifted towards the ICU (56% vs 37%, p < 0.01); shockable rhythm (VT/VF) (18% vs 29%, p = 0.05) and defibrillation were more frequent in the pandemic period (20% vs 35%, p < 0.05). Resuscitation times, rates of ROSC and post-CA characteristics were comparable in both periods. The severity of illness (SAPS II/SOFA), frequency of mechanical ventilation and frequency of vasopressor therapy after IHCA were higher during the 2020 period. Overall, 43 patients (12 with & 31 without COVID-19), presented with respiratory failure at the time of IHCA. The Horowitz index and resuscitation time were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 (each p < 0.01). Favourable outcomes were observed in 42 and 10% of patients with and without COVID-19-related respiratory failure, respectively., CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions declined during the pandemic, but a higher incidence of IHCA was observed. IHCA in patients with COVID-19 was a common finding. Compared to patients with non-COVID-19-related respiratory failure, the outcome was improved.	false
0	Impact of Pool Testing in Detection of Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19. Objective: During the current pandemic, COVID-19 has been detected in patients using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The demand for increased testing, particularly for asymptomatic individuals required alternative approaches to single-patient RT-PCR testing, such as pooling. Methods: This study explored the impact of dilution on the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients using RT-PCR and demonstrated that pooling can be effective in low prevalence populations. Results: The RT-PCR results for the 3:1, 5:1, and 7:1 aliquot samples showed little differences in CT values, confirming detection capability at these dilutions. Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, a pooled approach with up to 5:1 sample aliquots and using the current RT-PCR methodology likely will detect SARS CoV2 RNA among asymptomatic patients.	false
0	Cancer associates with risk and severe events of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Evidence is mounting to indicate that cancer patients may have more likelihood of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but lack consistency. A robust estimate is urgently needed to convey appropriate information to the society and the public, in the time of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through a comprehensive literature search in major databases in English and Chinese, and two investigators conducted publication selection and data extraction independently. A meta-analysis was used to obtain estimates of pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and determine the association of cancer with severe events, after assessment of potential heterogeneity, publication bias, and correction for the estimates when necessary. Total 38 studies comprising 7094 patients with COVID-9 were included; the pooled prevalence of cancer was estimated at 2.3% (95% confidence limit [CL] [0.018, 0.029]; P <.001) overall and 3.2% (95% CL [0.023, 0.041]; P <.001) in Hubei province; the corresponding estimates were 1.4% and 1.9% after correction for publication bias; cancer was significantly associated with the events of severe cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% CL [1.53, 3.17]; P <.001) and death (OR = 2.97, 95% CL [1.48, 5.96]; P =.002) in patients with COVID-19, there was no significant heterogeneity and a minimal publication bias. We conclude that cancer comorbidity is associated with the risk and severe events of COVID-19; special measures should be taken for individuals with cancer.Copyright © 2020 Union for International Cancer Control	false
0	Mental health of clinical staff working in high-risk epidemic and pandemic health emergencies a rapid review of the evidence and living meta-analysis. PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in acute medical staff, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of work involving high exposure to infected patients. METHOD(S): We report a rapid review, meta-analysis, and living meta-analysis of studies using validated measures from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULT(S): A random effects meta-analysis found that high-exposure work is not associated with an increased prevalence of above cut-off scoring (anxiety: RR=1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.93, Total N=12,473; PTSD symptoms: RR=1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.78, Total N=6604; depression: RR=1.50, 95% CI 0.57-3.95, Total N=12,224). For continuous scoring, high-exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low-exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.31, Total N=6493; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.20, 95% CI 0.01-0.40, Total N=5122; depression: SMD=0.13, 95% CI -0.04-0.31, Total N=4022). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION(S): Although epidemic and pandemic response work may add only a small additional burden, improving mental health through service management and provision of mental health services should be a priority given that baseline rates of poor mental health are already very high. As new studies emerge, they are being added to a living meta-analysis where all analysis code and data have been made freely available: https://osf.io/zs7ne/ .	false
0	Persistent COVID-19-associated neurocognitive symptoms in non-hospitalized patients. As cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mount worldwide, attention is needed on potential long-term neurologic impacts for the majority of patients who experience mild to moderate illness managed as outpatients. To date, there has not been discussion of persistent neurocognitive deficits in patients with milder COVID-19. We present two cases of non-hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19 with persistent neurocognitive symptoms. Commonly used cognitive screens were normal, while more detailed testing revealed working memory and executive functioning deficits. An observational cohort study of individuals recovering from COVID-19 (14 or more days following symptom onset) identified that among the first 100 individuals enrolled, 14 were non-hospitalized patients reporting persistent cognitive issues. These 14 participants had a median age of 39 years (interquartile range: 35-56), and cognitive symptoms were present for at least a median of 98 days (interquartile range: 71-120 following acute COVID-19 symptoms); no participants with follow-up evaluation reported symptom resolution. We discuss potential mechanisms to be explored in future studies, including direct viral effects, indirect consequences of immune activation, and immune dysregulation causing auto-antibody production.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Pharmacologic Thromboprophylaxis and Thrombosis in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Pooled Analysis. Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases thrombosis in hospitalized patients prompting adoption of different thromboprophylaxis strategies. Safety and efficacy of escalated-dose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis are not established. Objectives To determine the pooled incidence of thrombosis/bleeding in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for standard-dose, intermediate-dose, therapeutic anticoagulation, and no pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched up to August 29, 2020 for studies reporting pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis and thrombosis or bleeding. Pooled event rates were calculated using a random-effects model. Results Thirty-five observational studies were included. The pooled incidence rates of total venous thromboembolism (N = 4,685) were: no prophylaxis 41.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.1-57.2, I 2 = 76%), standard-dose prophylaxis 19.8% (95% CI: 13.2-28.6, I 2 = 95%), intermediate-dose prophylaxis 11.9% (95% CI: 4.3-28.6, I 2 = 91%), and therapeutic-dose anticoagulants 10.5% (95% CI: 4.2-23.8, I 2 = 82%, p = 0.003). The pooled incidence rates of arterial thrombosis (N = 1,464) were: no prophylaxis 11.3% (95% CI: 5.2-23.0, I 2 = 0%), standard-dose prophylaxis 2.5% (95% CI: 1.4-4.3, I 2 = 45%), intermediate-dose prophylaxis 2.1% (95% CI: 0.5-7.7, I 2 = 45%), and therapeutic-dose anticoagulants 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2-8.8, I 2 = 0, p = 0.009). The pooled bleeding event rates (N = 6,393) were nonsignificantly higher in therapeutic-dose anticoagulants compared with standard-dose prophylaxis, (6.3 vs. 1.7%, p = 0.083). Conclusion Thrombosis rates were lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Thrombosis and bleeding rates for patients receiving intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation were similar to those who received standard-dose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.Copyright © 2021.

0	Characteristics and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first 28 days of the spring and autumn pandemic waves in Milan: An observational prospective study. Background: The therapeutic approach to COVID-19 and healthcare system preparedness improved during 2020. We compared characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first 28 days of the March and October pandemic waves in Milan, Italy. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective, observational study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia during March 7-April 4 (1st period) and October 15-November 12 (2nd period). During the 1st period hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and therapeutic enoxaparin when thrombosis was confirmed were administered; systemic corticosteroids were given in case of severe pneumonia. During the 2nd period dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, remdesivir, thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation were administered according to international recommendations. Patients with respiratory distress on oxygen masks initiated CPAP. Outcomes were: length of hospital stay, all-cause in-hospital mortality and need for intubation. Result(s): We included 70 patients (75% males) during the 1st and 76 patients (51% males, p = 0.522) during the 2nd period. Prevalence of severe respiratory failure (30% vs. 12%, p = 0.006), and D-dimer >3000 FEU (34% vs. 15%, P = 0.012) were reduced during the 2nd period, while anticoagulation and corticosteroids were more frequently administered (both p < 0.01). Mortality and time to referral were also reduced (39.4% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.019 and 6 vs. 5 days, p = 0.014), while need for intubation didn't change. Hospitalization length was comparable, but the proportion of patients discharged home was higher during the 2nd period (28.2% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Changing treatment paradigms and early referral might have reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients. The effects of specific therapeutic regimens needs further confirmation in future clinical studies.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	An alternate prospect in detecting presymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers through odor differentiation by HeroRATs. The need for a cheap, ubiquitous, sensitive, rapid, noninvasive means of screening large numbers of presymptomatic and asymptomatic samples at departure or arrival into ports of countries, high-risk areas, and within communities forms the subject of this review. The widely used diagnostic test for the SARS-CoV 2 is the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools, but the lack of specialized nucleic acid extraction and amplification laboratories hampers/slows down timely large-scale testing. The use of animals with sensitive olfactory cue as an alternate testing model could serve as an alternative to detect COVID-19 in the saliva of carriers. The African giant rats are highly versatile and detect odorant molecules from carriers of pathogens with high percentage success after few months of training, hence can be taught to detect odor differences of COVID-19 in asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. If these are trained, they could help to curtail further spread of COVID infections.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Immune cell residency in the nasal mucosa and COVID-19 severity across the age range. <h4>Summary</h4> Severe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) positively correlates with age (Centers for Disease Control), develops after progression of infection from the upper airway to the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and can worsen into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Shi et al., 2020). Why children seem to be less likely to develop severe disease remains unclear. As the nasal mucosa (NM) is the first site of contact and defense for respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 before dissemination to the LRT (Casadei and Salinas, 2019), we hypothesized that differences in this tissue across the age range may help explain the disparity in COVID-19 severity. To this end, we profiled NM samples across the lifespan in health and disease. We find that global transcriptomic changes including the expression of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors are not correlated with age or the novel virus type, since pediatric NM cells mount similar antiviral response to both SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza B. Rather, we find immune cell residency in NM decreases dramatically with age especially cells of the innate immune system. This includes a resident-memory-like T cell subset with antiviral properties. These observations give plausible biological explanation to the observed clinical differences in disease spectrum and provide a foundation for future experimental studies.	false
0	The potential effectiveness of the WHO International Health Regulations capacity requirements on control of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of 114 countries. OBJECTIVES: We examined if the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities were associated with better COVID-19 pandemic control., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Population-based study of 114 countries., PARTICIPANTS: General population., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index., RESULTS: Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence (beta coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality (beta coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association., CONCLUSIONS: The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.	false
0	Human monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis for SARS coronavirus infection in ferrets. SARS coronavirus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China. No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available. We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus. Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3.3 logs (95% CI 2.6-4.0 logs; p<0.001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0.013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions. The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection.	false
0	Randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial on the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment regime on COVID-19 positive patients. BACKGROUND: Specific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Outcomes of clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore, it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against COVID-19., PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection., STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical trial., METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India. 1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast. Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day 7 of the study., RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 % recovery by day 7, while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20 times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 % absolute reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group., CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination. Reduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the treatment group. Moreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be associated with this treatment.

0	Coping strategies for obese individuals with obstructive sleep apnea during COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review. Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2- having pre-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs)- are at a higher risk of complications. Obesity is one of the proven risk factors causing NCDs and can influence outcomes of COVID-19 patients. It is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increased risk of COVID-19 and reduced access to treatment of non-COVID conditions during the pandemic may increase the stress in obese patients with OSA. This situation makes it necessary for them to cope with their condition by themselves. This review aimed at the effect of this pandemic on these patients and coping strategies for them., Methods: Databases like PubMed and Scopus were searched using a combination of key words. Full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected., Results: The search yielded eight studies, discussing about the potential interactions between the COVID-19, obesity and OSA, the impact of COVID-19 on them, and management of these patients., Conclusions: Increased prevalence of COVID-19 was found among obese patients with OSA. The fear of COVID-19 and shift of health care workers to manage COVID-19 patients has affected their regular visits to the hospital. However, there is lack of coping strategies for them, which should soon be established for these patients. Copyright © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission among Meat Processing Workers in Nebraska, USA, and Effectiveness of Risk Mitigation Measures. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely impacted the meat processing industry in the United States. We sought to detail demographics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections among workers in Nebraska meat processing facilities and determine the effects of initiating universal mask policies and installing physical barriers at 13 meat processing facilities. During April 1-July 31, 2020, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 5,002 Nebraska meat processing workers (attack rate 19%). After initiating both universal masking and physical barrier interventions, 8/13 facilities showed a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 incidence in <10 days. Characteristics and incidence of confirmed cases aligned with many nationwide trends becoming apparent during this pandemic: specifically, high attack rates among meat processing industry workers, disproportionately high risk of adverse outcomes among ethnic and racial minority groups and men, and effectiveness of using multiple prevention and control interventions to reduce disease transmission.	false
0	"Investigating connections between COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution and community interventions for Pakistan employing geoinformation technologies. Several major cities that witnessed heavy air pollution by particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have contributed to high rate of infection and severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Owing to the negative impact of COVID-19 on health and economy, it is imperative to predict the pandemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pakistan is one of the mostly affected countries by recent COVID-19 pandemic in terms of COVID-cases and economic crises. Like other several Asian countries to combat the virus impacts, Pakistan implemented non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as national lockdowns. The current study investigates the effect of major interventions across three out of four provinces of Pakistan for the period from the start of the COVID-19 in March 22, 2020 until June 30, 2020, when lockdowns were started to be eased. High-resolution data on NO2 was recorded from Sentinel-5's Precursor spacecraft with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI). Similarly, PM2.5 data were collected from sampling sties to investigate possible correlation among these pollutants and COVID-19. In addition, growth and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models utilizing time-series data of COVID-19 from February 26 to December 31, 2020, with- and without NPI that encompass the predicted number of infected cases, peak time, impact on the healthcare system and mortality in Pakistan. Maximum mean PM2.5 concentration of 108 mugm-3 was recorded for Lahore with the range from 51 to 215 mugm-3, during strict lockdown (L), condition. This is three times higher than Pak-EPA and US-EPA and four times for WHO guidelines, followed by Peshawar (97.2 and 58 +/- 130), Islamabad (83 and 158 +/- 58), and Karachi (78 and 50 +/- 140). The majority of sampling sites in Lahore showed NO2 levels higher than 8.75E-5 (mol/m2) in 2020 compared to 2019 during ""L"" period. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model depicted a strong correlation (r) between the predicted and reported cases for Punjab (r = 0.79), Sindh (r = 0.91), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) (r = 94) and Islamabad (r = 0.85). Findings showed that major NPI and lockdowns especially have had a large effect on minimizing transmission. Continued community intervention should be undertaken to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control in cities where higher incidence of COVID-19 cases until the vaccine is available. This study provides a methodological framework that if adopted can assist epidemiologist and policy makers to be well-prepared in advance in cities where PM2.5 concentration and NO2 levels are already high in order to minimize the potential risk of further spread of COVID-19 cases.

0	Background to new treatments for COVID-19, including its chronicity, through altering elements of the cytokine storm. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals, Dexamethasone and rIL-7 are of considerable interest in treating COVID-19 patients who are in danger of, or have become, seriously ill. Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well-conducted human trials. Newer information with anti-TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID-19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti-TNF biologicals on community-acquired COVID-19 during their long-term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL-7Ralpha, the receptor for IL-7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody-based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL-7- enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti-TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL-7, currently being trialed as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID-19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4-positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	439 Health-related quality of life and quality of care in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The physical, psychological and emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is as of yet unknown. With rising incidence of cases and the threat of resurgence the impact of COVID-19 has been felt worldwide, in particular among vulnerable and high-risk cohorts such as pregnant women. We aimed to conduct a prospective case-control study to compare self-reported health related quality of life (HRQoL) and quality of care (QoC) received between pregnant and postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic at an Irish tertiary maternity unit. Study Design: 18 perinatal women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 20 asymptomatic control perinatal women were recruited. Demographic characteristics were collected and all participants completed the Short Form (SF-12), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and Quality from the Patient's Perspective (QPP). Pregnant women, >=18 years of age, with capacity, who spoke English, and attended the tertiary unit during the pandemic were eligible for inclusion in the study. Main outcome measures of the study were physical and mental function, psychological distress, HRQoL and QoC. Mean scores in both cohorts were compared. Result(s): 95% of the Non-COVID cohort were Caucasian, while 67% of the pregnant women who had COVID-19 were not Caucasian (x2=16.01, p<0.0001). The mean SF-12 for physical health and functionality in the COVID cohort had significantly lower scores (36.54 vs 49.21, 95% CI [6.9 to 20.2], p<0.0002). There was no difference in mental health and wellbeing scores between the COVID and Non-COVID cohorts. The QoC experienced by both cohorts was similar and very positive. Conclusion(s): Among pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19, there was a significant greater burden on the women's physical health. Mental health and psychological status was similar in both groups. High quality of care during a pandemic is possible to deliver in a maternity setting, irrespective of the patient's COVID status.

0	Clinical Characteristics of Severe COVID-19 in China: A Case Series and Meta-analysis. <h4>Background: </h4> There have been inconsistent reports regarding the unique manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring in China. This study analyzed the clinical manifestation of 13 severe COVID-19 cases at a single institution and compared the data to previously reported characteristics of severe COVID-19 in China. <h4>Methods: </h4> This retrospective case study included patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the Shandong Chest Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020. The clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory examination results, imaging features, treatment strategies, and patient prognoses were summarized. A database search was then conducted for studies published through December 2020 documenting characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases in China. The pooled results for severe COVID-19 patients in China were calculated by using the random-effects model. <h4>Results: </h4>: A total of 4 severe and 9 critical patients were included from Shandong Chest Hospital. The average patient age was 55.3 (range 23-88) years, and 61.5% of patients were male. Chest computed tomography for all patients showed multiple lesions as ground-glass shadows in both lungs. All patients presented bacterial infection and various degrees of liver and myocardial injury. The treatment strategies for patients included antibiotics, immunoglobulin, and glucocorticoids, and mechanical ventilation was used in all patients for respiratory failure. Two patients died, and 11 recovered. In the pooled data for severe COVID-19 patients, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. The common signs in these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and a leukocyte count > 10. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Older males with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Patients should be assessed for concomitant bacterial infections. Cardiac and liver enzymes, fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and leukocytosis should be monitored for signs of disease progression.	false
0	Differential roles of RIG-I-like receptors in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are the major viral RNA sensors that are essential for activation of antiviral immune responses. However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 ( MDA5 −/− ), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5 −/− and MAVS −/− , but not in RIG-I −/− cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5 fold higher in RIG-I −/− than WT cells. These data demonstrate a dominant role of MDA5 in activating the type I/III IFN response to SARS-CoV-2, and an IFN-independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 role of RIG-I.	false

0	Diabetes, obesity, metabolism, and SARS-CoV-2 infection: the end of the beginning. The increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors in people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness has engendered considerable interest in the metabolic aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiology. Here, I update concepts informing how metabolic disorders and their co-morbidities modify the susceptibility to, natural history, and potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a focus on human biology. New data informing genetic predisposition, epidemiology, immune responses, disease severity, and therapy of COVID-19 in people with obesity and diabetes are highlighted. The emerging relationships of metabolic disorders to viral-induced immune responses and viral persistence, and the putative importance of adipose and islet ACE2 expression, glycemic control, cholesterol metabolism, and glucose- and lipid-lowering drugs is reviewed, with attention to controversies and unresolved questions. Rapid progress in these areas informs our growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes and obesity, while refining the therapeutic strategies and research priorities in this vulnerable population., COVID-19 infection produces excess mortality in people with obesity or diabetes. Here we review the epidemiology, susceptibility to infection, pathophysiology, immunology, complications, potential therapeutic options, and response to vaccinations in people with metabolic disorders and SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	A Covid-19 Patient with Complement-Mediated Coagulopathy and Severe Thrombosis. We report a patient with severe Covid-19-associated coagulopathy and type 2 diabetes mellitus who tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Analysis of skin specimens suggested direct SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced and complement-mediated vascular injury and thrombosis, consistent with prior reports. Serial aPL testing demonstrated high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) that declined to insignificant levels over a period of 5 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swab specimens on serial assays performed over the same 5-week period, though it was not detected thereafter. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced aPL contributed to severe Covid-19-associated coagulopathy in this patient.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	A Review of Coronary Artery Thrombosis: A New Challenging Finding in COVID-19 Patients and ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more information on the nonrespiratory effects of the coronavirus is obtained. Cardiovascular complications, especially acute coronary syndromes, are rare. However, they prove to be effective factors in the mortality rate of COVID-19 subjects. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a special angiographic pattern in the form of extensive and multivessel thrombosis, regardless of atherosclerotic plaques, has posed a new therapeutic challenge. This has been associated with an increase in the incidence of stent thrombosis. Hypercoagulation, due to severe inflammation, is the main pathology of this phenomenon. Technically, percutaneous coronary intervention with aspiration thrombectomy and injectable antiplatelet are the mainstay of treatment for these patients. In addition, it is vital that appropriate antiplatelet and ischemia treatment after the intervention be taken into account.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Reaction of Human Monoclonal Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Proteins With Tissue Antigens: Implications for Autoimmune Diseases. We sought to determine whether immune reactivity occurs between anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein antibodies and human tissue antigens, and whether molecular mimicry between COVID-19 viral proteins and human tissues could be the cause. We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.© Copyright © 2021 Vojdani, Vojdani and Kharrazian.	false
0	Depressive Symptoms, Sleep Quality and Diet During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Epidemic in China: A Survey of Medical Students. The psychological condition of medical students may be influenced by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. This study investigated the prevalence and influencing factors of depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and poor diet in students at Kunming Medical University during the early part of the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional study was used from a questionnaire survey in February 2020. Of a total of 1,026 study participants, the prevalence of depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, and poor diet was, respectively, 22.4, 33.2, and 17.4%. Male students and students with a low degree of focus on COVID-19 had a high risk of depressive symptoms. A high percentage of females and students in the fifth grade, as well as students with high levels of concern about the negative impact of COVID-19 on their education or employment, comprised those with poor sleep quality. Students in the fifth grade and students with high levels of concern about the negative impact of COVID-19 on their education or employment were more likely to report poor diet. This study suggests the importance of monitoring medical students' depressive state during the COVID-19 outbreak, and universities are encouraged to institute policies and programs to provide educational counseling and psychological support to help students to cope with these problems.

0	Analysis of systemic therapy delivery for gastrointestinal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: As of June 16, 0.51% of the Irish population has had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and incidence of new infections peaked on April 10. Cancer patients treated with systemic anticancer therapy (SACT) may have increased risk of contracting COVID-19, and greater incidence of adverse outcomes. We aimed to assess the impact of a COVID-19 SACT clinical pathway on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in gastrointestinal cancer patients, and alterations to SACT regimens attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): A COVID-19 SACT clinical pathway for patients undergoing treatment in a haematology oncology day care (HODC) service was designed and implemented. Interventions included visitor restrictions, telephone clinics, mandatory masks and temperature checks for staff, social distancing at all workspaces, and establishment of a COVID-19 screening pod. A prospective registry of all gastrointestinal cancer patients attending the HODC clinic between February 1 and April 31 2020 was initiated following institutional ethics board approval. Clinical data were retrieved from electronic health records including demographics, performance status, comorbidities, SACT regimen (including changes to treatment), SARS-CoV-2 testing, and radiologic treatment responses. Result(s): In this period, 175 gastrointestinal (88 gastroesophageal, 8 hepatobiliary, 79 colorectal) cancer patients attended 931 HODC outpatient clinics. Of this, 41 (23%) underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 test. No patients tested positive. Two gastroesophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy presented with SARS-CoV-2-negative suspected viral pneumonia and respiratory failure; both required intensive care unit admission and one died. SACT regimen was altered in 48 (27%) patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes involved prescription of alternative oral therapies (21; 12%), treatment breaks (17; 9%), and stopping treatment (11; 6%). Most (88%) regimen changes took place in a single 3-week period (6-27 March) that coincided with the announcement of government-mandated social distancing measures. Conclusion(s): Implementing a COVID-19 SACT clinical pathway resulted in a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in gastrointestinal patients undergoing systemic treatment. SACT regimen changes were common; prospective monitoring of this cohort is ongoing to determine whether these alterations affect patient outcomes.	false
0	Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a male with metabolic syndrome for 72 days: A case report. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, and spread gradually throughout the world. There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, such findings have not been documented in Bangladesh. Herein, we present a case of metabolic syndrome that remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over a prolonged period. On clinical and laboratory examination, the patient was diagnosed with obesity, raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and uncontrolled glycemia. However, upon taking appropriate measures and controlling the plasma sugar level, he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the 72nd day since illness onset. We observed that COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, may shed the virus over a prolonged period. Therefore, strict public health measures and isolation rules should be followed by a high-risk population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	The Use of Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution in Clipping Surgery for Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. Background: The occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has overwhelmed the blood supply chain worldwide and severely influenced clinical procedures with potential massive blood loss, such as clipping surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown. Method(s): Patients with aSAH who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patients in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, and complications were analyzed. Result(s): Sixty-two patients with aSAH were included between December 2019 and June 2020 (20 in the ANH group and 42 in the non-ANH group). ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs. 5 [11.9%]; P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5 +/- 2.5 g/dL vs. 10.3 +/- 2.0 g/dL; P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1 +/- 2.0 g/dL vs. 10.7 +/- 1.3 g/dL; P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin level on postoperative day 1 (odds ratio, 0.895; 95% confidence interval, 0.822-0.973; P = 0.010) was an independent risk factor for unfavorable outcome, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power to World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade (Z = 0.275; P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): ANH significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels, and it may hold the potential to improve patients' outcomes. Routine use of ANH should be considered in aneurysm clipping surgery.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Prevalence and correlates of chronic fatigue syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder after the outbreak of the COVID-19. As the SARS-COV-2 becomes a global pandemic, many researchers have a concern about the long COVID-19 complications. Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a persistent, debilitating, and unexplained fatigue disorder. We investigated psychological morbidities such as CFS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among survivors of COVID-19 over 6 months. All COVID-19 survivors from the university-affiliated hospital of Tehran, Iran, were assessed 6 months after infection onset by a previously validated questionnaire based on the Fukuda guidelines for CFS/EM and DSM-5 Checklist for PTSD (The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 or PCL-5) to determine the presence of stress disorder and chronic fatigue problems. A total of 120 patients were enrolled. The prevalence rate of fatigue symptoms was 17.5%. Twelve (10%) screened positive for chronic idiopathic fatigue (CIF), 6 (5%) for CFS-like with insufficient fatigue syndrome (CFSWIFS), and 3 (2.5%) for CFS. The mean total scores in PCL-5 were 9.27 +/- 10.76 (range:0-44), and the prevalence rate of PTSD was 5.8%. There was no significant association after adjusting between CFS and PTSD, gender, comorbidities, and chloroquine phosphate administration. The obtained data revealed the prevalence of CFS among patients with COVID-19, which is almost similar to CFS prevalence in the general population. Moreover, PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not associated with the increased risk of CFS. Our study suggested that medical institutions should pay attention to the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak.Copyright © 2021, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.	false
0	[Learning while studying dentistry]. The aim of the present study was to gain a better understanding of the significance, use and prevalence of digital as well as analog learning and teaching aids within dentistry studies at the University Center of Dental Medicine Basel (UZB) regarding sociodemographic aspects. A questionnaire was distributed among the three upper years of dental students at the UZB in the autumn semester before the corona pandemic. The results showed that all students use digital devices. The most often used devices in connection with academic studies were portable devices such as laptops or smartphones. It is to mention that students younger than 25 years used smartphones more often as learning aids than their older classmates. The devices were used on average 57 % of the total daily use time for study purposes, whereas private usage time decreased with age and progression of studies. In order to acquire theoretical knowledge, analog and digital formats were equally important. Digital learning aids were mainly used as digitalized lecture notes or for internet research. Advantages were especially seen in timesaving and organizational aspects. The analog learning aids were appreciated for their better learning and less tiring effect. The high prevalence and usage of mobile internet connectable devices as well as the high availability of the internet may indicate a tendency toward mobile learning.	false
0	Are the obese patients and patients with severe malnutrition at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 during hospital admission?. BACKGROUND: Recently, authorities highlighted the need for nutritional management of individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of body mass index (BMI) and nutrition risk index (NRI) on hospital admission for detecting patients at risk for malnutrition and obesity and their association with patients' outcomes (disease type, length of hospital and home stay, and inflammatory markers). METHOD(S): The study of 100 patients with confirmed diagnosis Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). Assessment of patients took place at City General Hospital 8th September, Skopje, transformed into main COVID-19 Center during pandemic. Primary outcomes were NRI and BMI scores, while secondary ones: length of home and hospital stay, number of symptoms, presence of co-morbidities, type of disease, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULT(S): Patients were classified according to BMI and NRI scores. Increased BMI and NRI were associated with a severe type of disease. Most of the patients with severe disease were: obese (83.3%) and patients with risk for malnutrition (53.3%). Obese patients had a longer length of home stay and higher CRP levels, but the level of albumin was lower in a group with a risk for malnutrition. CONCLUSION(S): Future studies are needed to identify and quantify specific screening tool for nutrition deficiency in patients with COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Zorica Markovska, Dragan Mijakoski, Katerina Kuzmanova, Iskra Meshkova, Ivana Tusheva, Sasho Stoleski.	false
0	Usability of saliva collection devices for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. There is an urgent need to expand testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens as the global community struggles to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Current diagnostic methods can be affected by supply chain bottlenecks and require the assistance of medical professionals, impeding the implementation of large-scale testing. Self-collection of saliva may solve these problems because it can be completed without specialized training and uses generic materials. In this study, we observed thirty individuals who self-collected saliva using four different collection devices and analyzed their feedback. These devices enabled the safe collection of saliva that was acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.	false
0	A multicentre collaboration to investigate the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease in human beings, first recognised in late February, 2003, in Hanoi, Vietnam. The severity of the disease, combined with its rapid spread along international air-travel routes, prompted WHO to set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to try to identify the causal agent and develop a diagnostic test. The network unites laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfil all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of a disease. Results are shared in real time via a secure website, on which microscopy pictures, protocols for testing, and PCR primer sequences are also posted. Findings are discussed in daily teleconferences. Progress is further facilitated through sharing between laboratories of samples and test materials. The network has identified a new coronavirus, consistently detected in samples of SARS patients from several countries, and conclusively named it as the causative agent of SARS; the strain is unlike any other known member of the genus Coronavirus. Three diagnostic tests are now available, but all have limitations.	false
0	"The ""Labeled"" Side of COVID-19 in India: Psychosocial Perspectives on Islamophobia During the Pandemic. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global public health threat over the last few months. Historically, infectious disease outbreaks like the plague, Influenza, cholera, HIV, etc. have generated stigma, prejudice, ""othering"" and xenophobia, against certain communities. One such prevalent form of xenophobia, is Islamophobia or ""fear and discrimination against the Muslims."" Though debated over its various facets and definitions, it is on the rise worldwide. India, being a socio-politically diverse and populous nation, has been facing unique challenges during COVID-19. Considering Hinduism and Islam are the two major religious communities, the subcontinent has witnessed complex dynamics in their relationship throughout history. The pandemic has further instigated Islamophobia, and consequent discrimination, as well as unrest. This can have significant effect of public behavior and health. In the recent past, few legislations in India were interpreted to be Islamophobic and generated nation-wide protest, which provided a fertile backdrop against the discriminative effects of the pandemic. Keeping this in background, this commentary highlights the social contexts of increase in Islamophobia in India during the pandemic, discusses the possible psychological explanations and public health impact, as well as outlines some ways to mitigate it focusing on collectivism.

0	Men and women affected by Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia: same CT features but different outcome. AIM: To compare the computed tomography (CT) features of Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia between the two sexes and among different age groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=331) who presented to the emergency department and underwent chest CT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a time interval <7 days, which were subsequently found to be consistent with Sars-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled retrospectively. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the images in consensus, recording the number of pulmonary lobes with ground-glass opacities and with consolidation. A CT score was subsequently calculated based on the percentage involvement of each lobe. Clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and level of required hospitalisation were noted. In-hospital mortality was recorded and analysed via the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULT(S): Males and females had the same age distribution. No statistically significant difference was found in the analysed CT features and in the CT score (p=0.31) between the sexes. More females were affected by two or more comorbidities (17.1% versus 7.5%, p=0.024), all comorbidities except diabetes were more prevalent in females. Women had a higher probability to be discharged home and a lower probability to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; p=0.008), in-hospital mortality was inferior (13.5% versus 22%). CONCLUSION(S): Despite more comorbidities, women had lower hospital admission and mortality, which was independent of CT findings between both sexes.Copyright © 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists	false
0	Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality. COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, is one of the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting therapeutic plasma with desired functionalities.	false
0	In vitro evolution of Remdesivir resistance reveals genome plasticity of SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir (RDV) is used widely for COVID-19 patients despite varying results in recent clinical trials. Here, we show how serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV selected for drug-resistant viral populations. We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we also observed changes in the Spike (i.e., H69 E484, N501, H655) corresponding to mutations identified in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. This study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 genome plasticity and offers new perspectives on surveillance of viral variants.	false
0	The Impact of Immunosuppression and Autoimmune Disease on Severe Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19. Immunosuppression (IS) and autoimmune disease (AD) are prevalent in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their impact on its clinical course is unknown. We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94-3.12; p = 0.081). Patients in this cohort also had higher median serum levels of interleukin-6 compared with IS-AD patients (98.2 vs 21.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0328) and NIS-NAD patients (29.1 pg/mL; p = 0.0057). In conclusion, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those receiving immunosuppressive treatment for an AD may have a reduced risk of developing severe ARDS.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 in Adolescents and Young Adults. Background: Adolescents and young adults might play a key role in the worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) because they are more likely to be involved in overseas study, business, work, and travel. However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics remain unknown., Methods: We collected demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data from 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital. Several key epidemiological parameters, asymptomatic cases, transmission to family members, and clinical characteristics at admission and during treatment were summarized., Results: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (30.4%) were aged between 10 and 24 years, and 24 (52.2%) patients were male. The estimated mean incubation period was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4-6.2). Three of the asymptomatic cases showed transmission to their family members. Only one patient was identified as a severe case at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 81.0%) and fever (29, 69.1%). Nearly 60% of the patients showed ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Most of the patients (78.3%) recovered and were discharged by the end of the follow-up., Conclusions: This single-center study with a relatively small sample size showed that adolescent and young adult patients with COVID-19 had a long incubation period and a short serial interval. The transmission occurred from asymptomatic cases to family members. Fewer patients developed complications during treatment. Copyright © 2020.	false
0	Comparison of the clinical performance and usefulness of five SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. We examined the usefulness of five COVID-19 antibody detection tests using 114 serum samples at various time points from 34 Japanese COVID-19 patients. We examined Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 from Roche, and four immunochromatography tests from Hangzhou Laihe Biotech, Artron Laboratories, Chil, and Nadal. In the first week after onset, Elecsys had 40% positivity in Group S (severe cases) but was negative in Group M (mild-moderate cases). The immunochromatography kits showed 40-60% and 0-8% positivity in Groups S and M, respectively. In the second week, Elecsys showed 75% and 50% positivity, and the immunochromatography tests showed 5-80% and 50-75% positivity in Groups S and M, respectively. After the third week, Elecsys showed 100% positivity in both groups. The immunochromatography kits showed 100% positivity in Group S. In Group M, positivity decreased to 50% for Chil and 75-89% for Artron and Lyher. Elecsys and immunochromatography kits had 91-100% specificity. Elecsys had comparable chronological change of cut-off index values in the two groups from the second week to the sixth week. The current SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection tests do not provide meaningful interpretation of severity and infection status. Its use might be limited to short-term epidemiological studies.	false

0	Initial symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Japan: A descriptive study. Fever, cough, malaise, and sore throat are the most common initial symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no studies have ever been conducted to investigate the initial symptoms of COVID-19 in Japan. By using publicly available data, we investigated 707 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed in 10 prefectures of Japan prior to May 16, 2020. The primary outcomes were the initial symptoms on the day of symptom onset. The proportions of patients with each symptom among the symptomatic patients were calculated. Of all the patients, 79 (11.2%) were asymptomatic. Among the 628 symptomatic patients, the most common initial symptom was fever (65.9%), followed by cough (23.5%), malaise (23.5%), and sore throat (12.9%). At least one of these four symptoms was reported in 88.2% of all symptomatic patients. Nineteen patients (3.0%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms, while six patients (1.0%) reported only the loss of smell or taste as the initial symptom. As in other countries, the most common initial symptoms of COVID-19 in Japan are fever, cough, malaise, and sore throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms and the loss of smell and taste are uncommon initial symptoms in Japan. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Diagnosis and treatment of 471 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Background: While the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has been largely kept under control in China, it remains a global pandemic, and the source, transmission route, and treatments of SARS-COV-2 are still being investigated. Here, we summarized the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients based on our clinical practice., Methods: The clinical and imaging findings, treatments, and follow-up data of 471 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital prior to February 6, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed., Results: Among these patients, there were 2 mild cases, 282 moderate cases, 181 severe cases, and 6 critical cases. There were 250 males and 221 females aged 17 to 90 years. The median age was 54 years in the severe/critical group, which was significantly older than in the mild/moderate group (P<0.05). 44.59% of them had one or more underlying diseases. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, and dyspnea. The median body temperature in the severe/critical group was 39degreeC, which was significantly higher than in the mild/moderate group (P<0.05). The incidences of lymphopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia were 53.5% and 41.86%, respectively. Ground-glass opacity and small patchy shadows were the most common findings on chest computed tomography (CT). Compared with the mild/moderate group, the severe/critical group showed higher proportions of severe lymphocytopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia, along with more ground-glass shadows and large-scale consolidation. After anti-infection, oxygen therapy, and symptomatic support, lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes were markedly increased, all patients were discharged. The median time of nucleic acid conversion and hospital stay were 9 and 12 days, respectively, which were significantly longer in the severe/critical group than in the mild/moderate group. Of the 390 cases followed, only 19 were hospitalized again due to other diseases. All patients recovered well from COVID-19, with negative nucleic acid test results., Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia were found to be associated with COVID-19 and thus may be important indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis. Multidisciplinary management including antiviral treatment, immune regulation, and symptomatic support is effective, and yields a low recurrence rate. Copyright 2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

0	Corticosteroids for CAP, influenza and COVID-19: when, how and benefits or harm?. PURPOSE: Corticosteroids have been considered in medicine for a long time, and they are broadly prescribed. In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, the evidence is quite strong and there is a clear benefit of the use of corticosteroids in those patients presenting severe forms of disease.

0	Paediatric exanthems presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chilblain-like acral eruptions, purpura, and erythema multiforme have been reported as cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in children. We report a series of palmar-plantar eruptions and laterothoracic exanthem referred to our paediatric dermatology service with increased frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed six cases of palmar-plantar eruptions. Average age was 5.8 years (range 2-11); female-male ratio was 2:4. Two children were siblings. All patients woke up in the morning with tender erythematous macules and nodules on the plantar feet. Two patients had similar palmar lesions. Patients reported mild systemic symptoms. Lesions resolved within 2-weeks without treatment. There were no associated medications nor co-morbidities. None of the patients had contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Nasopharyngeal COVID-19 swab testing and serum COVID-19 IgG antibody testing conducted in one patient was negative. We observed two cases of laterothoracic exanthem. One female and one male, aged 2 and 1-years. There were no recent medications or unwell contacts. The eruptions resolved within 5-weeks with topical steroid treatment. Serological testing for Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, and parvovirus B19 was negative in both patients. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab testing was conducted in one patient and was negative. These cutaneous manifestations could be COVID-19 related due to increased presentation frequency. The palmar-plantar eruptions differ from previously described COVID-19 chilblain-like eruptions affecting mainly digits. Flexural maculopapular rashes have been reported in COVID-19 confirmed adults but not in children. Viral associated laterothoracic exanthem classically presents in winter and spring. Summer presentation and temporal relationship to the pandemic suggest a COVID-19 association.	false
0	Estimating the infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during the spring 2020 pandemic wave: a model-based analysis. Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. Method(s): In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and >=75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). Finding(s): During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1.39% (95% credible interval 1.04-1.77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and >=75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0.116% (0.0729-0.148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0.939% (0.729-1.19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4.87% (3.37-6.89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14.2% (10.2-18.1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6.72% (5.52-8.01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19.1% (14.7-21.9) for those aged 75 years and older. Interpretation(s): Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

0	Encephalopathy and encephalitis during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spanish Society of Neurology COVID-19 Registry. Objectives: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spanish Society of Neurology has run a registry of patients with neurological involvement for the purpose of informing clinical neurologists. Encephalopathy and encephalitis were among the most frequently reported complications. In this study, we analyse the characteristics of these complications. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive, observational, multicentre study of patients with symptoms compatible with encephalitis or encephalopathy, entered in the Spanish Society of Neurology's COVID-19 Registry from 17 March to 6 June 2020. Result(s): A total of 232 patients with neurological symptoms were registered, including 51 cases of encephalopathy or encephalitis (21.9%). None of these patients were healthcare professionals. The most frequent syndromes were mild or moderate confusion (33%) and severe encephalopathy or coma (9.8%). The mean time between onset of infection and onset of neurological symptoms was 8.02 days. Lumbar puncture was performed in 60.8% of patients, with positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in only one case. Brain MRI studies were performed in 47% of patients, with alterations detected in 7.8% of these. EEG studies were performed in 41.3% of cases, detecting alterations in 61.9%. Conclusion(s): Encephalopathy and encephalitis are among the complications most frequently reported in the registry. More than one-third of patients presented mild or moderate confusional syndrome. The mean time from onset of infection to onset of neurological symptoms was 8 days (up to 24 hours earlier in women than in men). EEG was the most sensitive test in these patients, with very few cases presenting alterations in neuroimaging studies. All patients treated with boluses of corticosteroids or immunoglobulins progressed favourably.Copyright © 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia	false
0	Impact of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh: a spatiotemporal approach. It has been more than 10 months since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Wuhan, China, still menacing the world with a possible second wave. This study aimed to analyze how meteorological variables can affect the spread of local COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Nine spatial units were considered from a meteorological standpoint to characterize COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. The daily COVID-19 incidence and meteorological variable (e.g., mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) data from April 5 to September 20, 2020, were collected. The Spearman rank correlation, heat maps, and multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were employed to understand their association. The effect of meteorological variables on COVID-19 transmission was modeled using a lag period of 10 days. Results showed that mean temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed are substantially associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, daily precipitation is significantly associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19 incidence. The relative risks (RR) of mean temperature for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.222 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.214-1.232). For wind speed, the RR was 1.087 (95% CI, 1.083-1.090). For relative humidity, the RR was 1.027 (95% CI, 1.025-1.029). Overall, this study found the profound effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 incidence across selected nine areas in Bangladesh. This study is probably the first study to explore the impact of region-specific meteorological conditions on COVID-19 incidence in Bangladesh. Moreover, adjustments on the areal-aggregated and regional levels were made for three confounding factors, including lockdown, population density, and potential seasonal effects. The study's findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in high temperatures and humidity conditions, which contradicts many other countries' prior studies. The research outcomes will provide implications for future control and prevention measures in Bangladesh and other countries with similar climate conditions and population density.

0	Mental health difficulties of adults with COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional correlational study. Background: The rapid spread of novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) coupled with inefficient testing capacities in Bangladesh has resulted in a number of deaths from COVID-19-like symptoms that have no official test results. This study was the first study that explored the mental health of adults with the most common COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh., Methods: This cross-sectional correlational study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables., Results: The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms of the overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms reported higher odds for stress level (AOR = 2.043, CI = 1.51 to 2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR = 2.770, CI = 2.04 to 3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.482, CI = 1.12 to 1.96) than asymptomatic respondents., Limitations: There was a chance of recall bias as it was not possible to validate the information due to the retrospective design of the study. Recruitment methods only captured internet users, which reduces the generalizability of findings., Conclusions: Patients with symptoms like those of COVID-19 should be prioritized in the healthcare setting in order to reduce mental health difficulties throughout the pandemic .

0	Perceived uncertainty stress and its predictors among residents in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of and risk factors for uncertainty stress among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore and identify the risk factors for high perceived uncertainty stress among the general public in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Information about the respondents' socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19, perceived uncertainty stress, social capital, anxiety, and depressive symptoms was collected and analysed. Among the 1205 respondents, 45.3% (546) reported a high level of uncertainty stress. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that anxiety (beta=3.871,P<0.001) and depression symptoms (beta=2.458, P<0.001), family residence (in towns or rural areas) (beta=0.947, P<0.001), lack of support for local epidemic control strategies (beta=1.253, P<0.001), worry about the pandemic (beta=1.191, P<0.001), and symptoms of weakness among family members (beta=1.525, P=0.002) were positively associated with perceived uncertainty stress. Cognitive social capital (beta=-0.883, P<0.001) and social networks (beta=-0.726, P<0.001) were negatively, but social participation (beta=0.714, P<0.001) was positively associated with perceived uncertainty stress. Our findings identify factors associated with a higher level of uncertainty stress and should be helpful in the consideration of effective policies and interventions for uncertainty stress during the initial phases of public health emergencies.	false
0	Intracranial hemorrhage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Background: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with or develop cerebrovascular disease during the course of hospitalization. Whereas ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients has been well described, data on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and August 14, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify eligible studies. Result(s): A total of 23 studies describing ICH in 148 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-0.9), with low levels of inter-study heterogeneity observed (I2 = 33.6%, Cochran's Q = 12.05, p = 0.149). Most of the patients were elderly male patients (65.8%) with comorbidities, the most common being systemic hypertension (54%). Hemorrhage involving multiple cranial compartments was reported in 9.5% of cases. Single compartments were involved in the rest, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) being the most common variety (62.6%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) the least common (1.4%). Half of these patients were on some form of anticoagulation. Overall, the mortality rate in the COVID-19 patients with ICH was about 48.6%. Conclusion(s): Although relatively uncommon among COVID-19 patients, ICH is associated with a high mortality rate. Early identification of patients at risk of developing ICH, particularly with comorbid conditions and on anticoagulant therapy, may be important to improve outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.	false
0	Serum Prealbumin Concentrations, COVID-19 Severity, and Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Excessive inflammation and malnutrition are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. Combined biomarkers of malnutrition and inflammation, such as serum prealbumin, might be particularly attractive for early risk stratification. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting serum prealbumin in patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, between January and November 2020, for studies reporting data on serum prealbumin, COVID-19 severity, defined as severe illness, prolonged viral load, receiving mechanical ventilation or admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality. Nineteen studies in 4,616 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that serum prealbumin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with severe disease and non-survivors (standard mean difference, SMD, -0.92, 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.74, P < 0.001). Extreme heterogeneity was observed (I 2 = 77.9%; P < 0.001). In sensitivity analysis, the effect size was not significantly affected when each study was in turn removed (range between -0.86 and -0.95). The Begg's (P = 0.06) and Egger's t-tests (P = 0.26) did not show publication bias. Pooled SMD values were significantly and negatively associated with age (t = -2.18, P = 0.045) and C-reactive protein (t = -3.85, P = 0.002). In our meta-analysis, lower serum prealbumin concentrations were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. This combined marker of malnutrition and inflammation might assist with early risk stratification and management in this group. Copyright © 2021 Zinellu and Mangoni.	false
0	Fear and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis during COVID-19 pandemic; report of an Iranian population. BACKGROUND: There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations., RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (+/-10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false

There were no confirmed severe or critically ill cases among the patients. Conclusion COVID-19 runs in a benign course in Egyptian children with no mortality and no significant morbidity.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	Can biomarkers of extracellular matrix remodelling and wound healing be used to identify high risk patients infected with SARS-CoV-2?: lessons learned from pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis has been identified as a main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and poor quality of life in post-recovery Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) survivor's consequent to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus there is an urgent medical need for identification of readily available biomarkers that in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection are able to; (1) identify patients in most need of medical care prior to admittance to an intensive care unit (ICU), and; (2) identify patients post-infection at risk of developing persistent fibrosis of lungs with subsequent impaired quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. An intense amount of research have focused on wound healing and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) remodelling of the lungs related to lung function decline in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). A range of non-invasive serological biomarkers, reflecting tissue remodelling, and fibrosis have been shown to predict risk of acute exacerbations, lung function decline and mortality in PF and other interstitial lung diseases (Sand et al. in Respir Res 19:82, 2018). We suggest that lessons learned from such PF studies of the pathological processes leading to lung function decline could be used to better identify patients infected with SARS-Co-V2 at most risk of acute deterioration or persistent fibrotic damage of the lung and could consequently be used to guide treatment decisions.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Potent neutralization of clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 D614 and G614 variants by a monomeric, sub-nanomolar affinity nanobody. Despite unprecedented global efforts to rapidly develop SARS-CoV-2 treatments, in order to reduce the burden placed on health systems, the situation remains critical. Effective diagnosis, treatment, and prophylactic measures are urgently required to meet global demand: recombinant antibodies fulfill these requirements and have marked clinical potential. Here, we describe the fast-tracked development of an alpaca Nanobody specific for the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with potential therapeutic applicability. We present a rapid method for nanobody isolation that includes an optimized immunization regimen coupled with VHH library E. coli surface display, which allows single-step selection of Nanobodies using a simple density gradient centrifugation of the bacterial library. The selected single and monomeric Nanobody, W25, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with sub-nanomolar affinity and efficiently competes with ACE-2 receptor binding. Furthermore, W25 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 wild type and the D614G variant with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, demonstrating its potential as antiviral agent.	false
0	The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children. One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.	false
0	Dynamic angiopoietin-2 assessment predicts survival and chronic course in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study examined the association between dynamic angiopoietin-2 assessment and COVID-19 short- and long-term clinical course. We included consecutive hospitalized patients from 1 February to 31 May 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 Italian tertiary referral centers (derivation cohort, n = 187 patients; validation cohort, n = 62 patients). Serum biomarker levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissue from 9 patients was stained for angiopoietin-2, Tie2, CD68, and CD34. Cox model was used to identify risk factors for mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess the accuracy of 3- and 10-day angiopoietin-2 for in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition, respectively. Three-day angiopoietin-2 increase of at least twofold from baseline was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-24.19; P = .004) with AUROC = 0.845 (95% CI, 0.725-0.940). Ten-day angiopoietin-2 of at least twofold from baseline was instead significantly associated with nonresolving pulmonary condition by multivariate analysis (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.34-11.77; P <= .0001) with AUROC = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.919-1.000). Patients with persistent elevation of 10-day angiopoietin-2 levels showed severe reticular interstitial thickening and fibrous changes on follow-up computed tomography scans. Angiopoietin-2 and Tie2 were diffusely colocalized in small-vessel endothelia and alveolar new vessels and macrophages. Angiopoietin-2 course is strongly associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Angiopoietin-2 may be an early and useful predictor of COVID-19 clinical course, and it could be a relevant part of disease pathogenesis. Angiopoietin-2 blockade may be a COVID-19 treatment option.

0	Stability analysis and optimal control of Covid-19 pandemic SEIQR fractional mathematical model with harmonic mean type incidence rate and treatment. In the present work, we investigated the transmission dynamics of fractional order SARS-CoV-2 mathematical model with the help of Susceptible S ( t ) , Exposed E ( t ) , Infected I ( t ) , Quarantine Q ( t ) , and Recovered R ( t ) . The aims of this work is to investigate the stability and optimal control of the concerned mathematical model for both local and global stability by third additive compound matrix approach and we also obtained threshold value by the next generation approach. The author's visualized the desired results graphically. We also control each of the population of underlying model with control variables by optimal control strategies with Pontryagin's maximum Principle and obtained the desired numerical results by using the homotopy perturbation method. The proposed model is locally asymptotically unstable, while stable globally asymptotically on endemic equilibrium. We also explored the results graphically in numerical section for better understanding of transmission dynamics. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Can COVID-19 Cause Flare-Ups of Acute Hepatitis B? An Atypical Presentation of COVID-19 with Acute Hepatitis B. We report a case of fulminant liver failure in a patient with acute active hepatitis B infection who was found to have COVID-19 without lung involvement. A 24-year-old male was brought by ambulance service to Hamad General Hospital, Emergency Department (ED), in Doha on April 8, 2020, with chief complaints of fever and cough for 3 days. Upon initial evaluation, the patient was febrile (39.4degreeC), jaundiced, and disoriented regarding time, place, and person, with an unremarkable past medical history. Initial blood tests showed severely elevated urea, creatinine, transaminases, and ammonium in addition to an impaired coagulation profile consistent with fulminant liver failure. A swab was taken for COVID-19 PCR testing and found to be positive. Serological tests revealed hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and other serology indicating acute hepatitis B. Initial X-ray and repeat chest X-rays did not show lung infiltrates. On the 6th day after admission, the patient developed fixed dilated pupils, with brain edema on CT; cardiac arrest occurred on the 10th day after admission, and the patient died. Although it is still largely unclear, HBV0-activated sudden-onset strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and enhanced viral replication and/or retention of the viral capsid in infected hepatocytes may cause the pathogenesis of FH. These pathophysiological events cause extensive hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which results in deadly severe liver failure. Our findings support that the liver damage occurring in COVID-19 is caused by an impaired innate immune system rather than by direct cell damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. We think that more consideration should be given to the presence of acute hepatitis B, especially in COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2021 Yavuz Yigit et al.	false
0	Point-of-care test system for detection of immunoglobulin-G and -M against nucleocapsid protein and spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to ravage the world. In epidemic control, dealing with a large number of samples is a huge challenge. In this study, a point-of-care test (POCT) system was successfully developed and applied for rapid and accurate detection of immunoglobulin-G and -M against nucleocapsid protein (anti-N IgG/IgM) and receptor-binding domain in spike glycoprotein (anti-S-RBD IgG/IgM) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Any one of the IgG/IgM found in a sample was identified as positive. The POCT system contains colloidal gold-based lateral flow immunoassay test strips, homemade portable reader, and certified reference materials, which detected anti-N and anti-S-RBD IgG/IgM objectively in serum within 15 min. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity. It exhibited equal to or better performances than four approved commercial kits. Results of the system and chemiluminescence immunoassay kit detecting 108 suspicious samples had high consistency with kappa coefficient at 0.804 (P < 0.001). Besides, the levels and alterations of the IgG/IgM in an inpatient were primarily investigated by the POCT system. Those results suggested the POCT system possess the potential to contribute to rapid and accurate serological diagnosis and epidemiological survey of COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

0	Looking for fever in nursing home residents with COVID-19: A false friend?. Objectives: Residents in nursing homes represent a frail, elderly population, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread easily in this setting. Despite a frequent severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), these patients often present an atypical course with mild initial symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of fever in elderly patients with COVID-19 residing in nursing homes. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty-one elderly patients from three nursing homes in Pavia and surrounding area were enrolled in April-May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with nasopharyngeal swab and/or serological assay (LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG). Patients with a positive result on RT-PCR or serology were classed as positive. Result(s): In total, 170 patients (74%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive on RT-PCR and/or serology, and 61 patients (26%) had negative results on both tests. Fever (body temperature >37.5 degreeC) was observed in four patients (1.7%): three in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (1.8%) and one in the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (1.6%). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of fever was extremely low in this population of nursing home residents with COVID-19. This finding must be taken into consideration when screening patients without fever in nursing homes.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Saliva is more sensitive than nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs for diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 infection. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swab compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for COVID-19 testing in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore. We also tested the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for diagnosis of COVID-19. Saliva, NP and SN swabs were collected from subjects who presented with acute respiratory infection, their asymptomatic roommates, and prior confirmed cases who were undergoing isolation at a community care facility in June 2020. All samples were tested using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based NGS with phylogenetic analysis was done for 30 samples. We recruited 200 subjects, of which 91 and 46 were tested twice and thrice respectively. In total, 62.0%, 44.5%, and 37.7% of saliva, NP and SN samples were positive. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower during the earlier period of infection across all sample types. The percentage of test-positive saliva was higher than NP and SN swabs. We found a strong correlation between viral genome coverage by NGS and Ct values for SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analyses revealed Clade O and lineage B.6 known to be circulating in Singapore. We found saliva to be a sensitive and viable sample for COVID-19 diagnosis.	false
0	Geographic distribution of mental health problems among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Nationwide, web-based survey study. Background: Since the COVID-19 outbreak was first reported, considerable attention has been drawn to mental health problems among college students. Objective(s): We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas of China during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese college students of 16 provinces or municipalities from February 4 to 12, 2020. A web-based survey was adopted to collect information from these college students, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward the epidemic and its control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of perceived risk of infection and attitude toward COVID-19 among college students in different geographic locations. Binary logistic models were used to identify associations between geographic locations and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. Result(s): A total of 11,787 participants were analyzed in this study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students was 17.8% (95% CI 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95% CI 25.1%-26.7%), respectively. After controlling for covariates, current residence area in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.59). Similarly, college location in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36). History of residence in or travel to Wuhan city in the past month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.46-1.80) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.35-1.63). Furthermore, the perceived risk of COVID-19 was higher among students whose college location and current residence area were in Wuhan city, and it was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse. Our study results provide further insight for policymakers to develop targeted intervention strategies.Copyright © Xiaoyan Wu, Shuman Tao, Yi Zhang, Shiyue Li, Le Ma, Yizhen Yu, Guilong Sun, Tingting Li, Fangbiao Tao.

0	COVID-19-Related Giant Coronary Aneurysms in an Infant with Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder in Children: The First Case Report from the United Arab Emirates and the Arab Region. Background: Multisystem inflammatory disorder in children and adolescents is a relatively new and rare complication of COVID-19. This complication seems to develop after the infection rather than during the acute phase of COVID-19. The clinical features are similar to a well-known inflammatory syndrome in children, Kawasaki disease, and it can lead to collapse and multiple organ failure requiring intensive care. The COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents is referred to mutually as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally linked with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) correlated with COVID-19, and here, it is referred to as MIS-C. Case Presentation. This report describes a nine-month-old Asian infant presented with a two-week history of fever with nonspecific signs of viral illness and erythematous rash. The clinical and biochemical findings were compatible with complicated typical Kawasaki disease (KD). The infant fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, which he responded well to. He was discharged home in good condition after almost 3 weeks of treatment., Conclusion: This case highlights a rare but new phenomenon attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We report the first case report of MIS-C in the United Arab Emirates and Arab region. Among KD's complications, massive aneurysm with thrombosis is rare and usually will have deleterious results if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Copyright © 2021 Ghassan Ghatasheh et al.	false
0	Covid-19 triggers the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis: A case report of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Background: The new COVID-19 has been reported as a risk factor for diabetic ketoacidosis in patient with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2. Diabetes mellitus is associated with several micro-and macro-vascular complications. Diabetic ketoacidosis is occurred as a result of imbalance between insulin and its counterregulatory hormones. Case Report: A 33-year-old male has presented to emergency department with polyuria, polydipsia, and lethargy for three days. He was tested positive with SARS-COV-2. The patient showed morbid obesity and he was on several self-medication products and home remedies for treating COVID-19. Laboratory confirmed the hyperglycemia where random blood glucose level was between 255-345 mg/dl and A1C was 11.66%. Ketone bodies were detected in the urine. Poor diabetes control, infection, obesity, and persistence hyperglycemia have also precipitated the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient was resuscitated with fluids and insulin therapy. After 24 hours, the diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms were resolved. Conclusion(s): Patients with diabetes mellitus should be aware of the importance of medication adherence and diet control. Further studies on the relationship between the infection with SARS-COV-2 and the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis will delineate the pathophysiological mechanism.Copyright © 2021, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Return to sports after COVID-19 infection. The cardiovascular effects and long-term consequences of COVID-19 are currently unclear. The question of eligibility for sport and the point of return to sport following both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with or without suspected involvement of the myocardium is currently becoming more and more important in leisure as well as in competitive sports. Fortunately, from previous studies and registries of acute myocarditis, it has been known that athletes with a complete recovery have a very good prognosis. Nevertheless, to optimize counselling and treatment of athletes in the future, prospective data collection on the current corona pandemic is urgently needed. To this end, the non-evidence-based recommendations for a return to sports presented herein might serve as a first guideline.Copyright © 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Factors associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody production in patients convalescing from COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the factors that affect anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody production remain unclear. This study aimed to identify such factors among patients convalescing from COVID-19., METHODS: This study comprised patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and June 30, 2020 and gave consent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during their acute and/or convalescent phases. Factors related to elevated antibody titers and the relationship between the days from disease onset and the development of antibody titers were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 84 participants enrolled in the study. Nineteen participants had antibody titers measured during the convalescent phase only, and 65 participants had antibody titers measured during the acute and convalescent phases. The antibody titers peaked in weeks 5 and 6. The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers., CONCLUSION: The study found that high values of maximum CRP levels during the acute phase, male sex, and diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated antibody titers. Antibody titers tended to be highest in the first 5 or 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Copyright © 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

Background and aim of the work: The effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 disease is debated, with common sense and experts suggesting a deleterious effect, and manuscripts worldwide reporting a low prevalence of active tobacco smokers among intensive care unit patients. Method(s): We categorized countries worldwide into three groups with <25%; 25-45%; >45% of active male smokers with data expressed as median and interquartile range [IQR] and extracted data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths per million inhabitants from public available databases. We also applied multivariate regression techniques to adjust for several epidemiological factors. Result(s): COVID-19 mortality was 13 (5-24) per million inhabitants in countries with male smokers >45% and 33 (4-133) in countries where male smokers were <25%. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 436 (217-954) and 1139 (302-4084) per million inhabitants with data confirmed when dividing data for each continent and when controlling for confounding factors. Conclusion(s): We found a counterintuitive low COVID-19 mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection in countries with high prevalence of male smokers at the global level and within each continent, suggesting that active smoking habit is protective. Further research should urgently investigate which is the possible mechanism of action. (www.actabiomedica.it).Copyright © Mattioli 1885.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing: The tower of babel. Summary. Background and aim: Testing represents one of the main pillars of public health response to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. Method(s): We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. Result(s): Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. Conclusion(s): Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential. We advocate the use of pooled strategies when planning population-wide screening, and the weekly use of rapid tests for close periodic monitoring in low-prevalence populations.

0	Saliva is a promising alternative specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults. Testing efforts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for health care workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to that of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS was compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordances for saliva and NPS were 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The values for positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS were 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva yielded detection of 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. For symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA, 82.4% versus 85.3%). The overall values for PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva yielding detection of 4 fewer cases than NPS. However, saliva performance for symptomatic adults was identical to NPS performance (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate sample choice alternative to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	Seroprevalence and attainment of herd immunity against SARS CoV-2: A modelling study. <h4>Objective: </h4> The present study is aims to predict the likelihood of and likely time required to attain herd immunity against COVID-19 in New Delhi due to natural infection. Method: An ODE based mathematical model was constructed by extending the classical SEIR model to predict the seroprevalence rate in Delhi. We estimated the parameter values for Delhi using available data (reported cases and the seroprevalence rate) and used them for future prediction. We also attempted to capture the changes in the seroprevalence rate with different possibilities of reinfection. <h4>Results:</h4> Maximum seroprevalence rate obtained through our model is 31.65% and also a reduction in the seroprevalence rate was observed for the upcoming one month (month of January, 2021) due to the reduced transmission rate. After increasing the transmission rate to the value same as the third wave in New Delhi, we obtained a maximum value of 54.96%. This maximum value significantly decreased with the reduction in the reinfection possibilities. Also, a little impact of the duration of persistence of antibodies, 180 vs 105 days, was observed on the maximum seroprevalence. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This modelling study suggests that natural infection alone, as gauged by serial sero-surveys, will not result in attainment of herd immunity in the state of Delhi.	false
0	A flexible, pan-species, multi-antigen platform for the detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the vaccination effort that is ongoing has created an unmet need for accessible, affordable, flexible and precise platforms for monitoring the induction, specificity and maintenance of virus-specific immune responses. Herein we validate a multiplex (Luminex-based) assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies irrespective of host species, antibody isotype, and specimen type (e.g. plasma, serum, saliva or blood spots). The well-established precision of Luminex-based assays provides the ability to follow changes in antibody levels over time to many antigens, including multiple permutations of the most common SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This platform can easily measure antibodies known to correlate with neutralization activity as well as multiple non-SARS-CoV-2 antigens such as vaccines ( e . g . Tetanus toxoid) or those from frequently encountered agents (influenza), which serve as stable reference points for quantifying the changing SARS-specific responses. All of the antigens utilized in our study can be made in-house, many in E. coli using readily available plasmids. Commercially sourced antigens may also be incorporated and newly available antigen variants can be rapidly produced and integrated, making the platform adaptable to the evolving viral strains in this pandemic. <h4>Brief Summary</h4> A multi-antigen assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies irrespective of host species, antibody isotype, and specimen type was developed.	false
0	Implementation, adherence, and results of systematic SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic patients treated at a tertiary care regional radiation oncology network. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a current pandemic. We initiated a program of systematic SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in all asymptomatic patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) at a large radiation oncology network in the Charlotte, NC metropolitan region and report adherence and results of the testing program., METHODS: Patients undergoing simulation for RT between May 18, 2020 and July 10, 2020 within the Levine Cancer Institute radiation oncology network who were asymptomatic for COVID-19 associated symptoms, without previous positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, and without recent high-risk contacts were included. PCR testing was performed on nasal cavity or nasopharyngeal swab samples. Testing was performed within 2 weeks of RT start (pre-RT) and at least every 4 weeks during RT for patients with prolonged RT courses (intra-RT). An automated task based process using the oncology electronic medical record (EMR) was developed specifically for this purpose., RESULTS: A total of 604 unique patients were included in the cohort. Details on testing workflow and implementation are described herein. Pre-RT PCR testing was performed in 573 (94.9%) patients, of which 4 (0.7%) were positive. The adherence rate to intra-RT testing overall was 91.6%. Four additional patients (0.7%) tested positive during their RT course, of whom 3 were tested due to symptom development and 1 was asymptomatic and identified via systematic testing. A total of 8 (1.3%) patients tested positive overall. There were no known cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from infected patients to clinic staff and/or other patients., CONCLUSIONS: We detailed the workflows used to implement systematic SARS-CoV-2 for asymptomatic patients at a large radiation oncology network. Adherence rates for pre-RT and intra-RT testing were high using this process. This information allowed for appropriate delay in initiating RT, minimizing the occurrence of RT treatment interruptions, and no known cases of transmission from infected patients to clinic staff and/or other patients.	false
0	Viral Clearance and Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Kidney Transplant Recipients. Objectives: Knowledge about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) concerning viral shedding and humoral immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is limited. The aim of this study is to analyze viral dynamics and the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs with COVID-19 and study their association with clinical data. Material(s) and Method(s): Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusion(s): In our series, KTRs with severe COVID-19 had prolonged viral shedding and a stronger humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. These preliminary data need to be confirmed with further studies and over a longer period of time.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing For All - Using Non-Dilutive Saliva Sample Collection, Stabilization and Ambient Transport Devices. COVID-19 testing is not accessible for millions during this pandemic despite our best efforts. Without greatly expanded testing of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing and subsequent isolation of spreaders remains as a means for control. In an effort to increase RT-PCR assay testing for the presence of the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as well as improve sample collection safety, GenTegra LLC has introduced two products for saliva collection and viral RNA stabilization: GTR-STM TM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium) and GTR-STMdk TM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium Direct to PCR). Both products contain a proprietary formulation based on GenTegra's novel ""Active Chemical Protection TM"" (ACP) technology that gives non-dilutive, error-free saliva sample collection using RNA stabilization chemicals already dried in the collection tube. GTR-STM can be used for safer saliva-based sample collection at home (or at a test site). Following saliva collection, the sample-containing GTR-STM can be kept at ambient temperature during shipment to an authorized CLIA lab for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in GTR-STM is stable for over a month at ambient temperature, easily surviving the longest transit times from home to lab. GTR-STM enhances patient comfort, convenience, compliance and reduces infectious virus exposure to essential medical and lab professionals. Alternatively, the GTR-STMdk direct-into-PCR product can be used to improve lab throughput and reduce reagent costs for saliva sample collection and testing at any lab site with access to refrigeration. GTR-STMdk reduces lab process time by 25% and reagent costs by 30% compared to other approaches. Since GTR-STMdk retains SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability for three days at ambient temperature, it is optimized for lab test site rather than at home saliva collection. SARS-COV-2 viral RNA levels as low as 0.4 genome equivalents/uL are detected in saliva samples using GTR-STMdk. The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection can expand COVID-19 testing to include asymptomatic individuals using pooled saliva., One Sentence Summary: GTR-STM and Direct-into-PCR GTR-STMdk offer substantive improvements in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability, safety, and RT-PCR process efficiency for COVID-19 testing by using a non-dilutive saliva sample collection system for individuals at home or onsite respectively."	false
0	Intimate partner violence among prenatal care attendees amidst the COVID-19 crisis: The incidence in Ethiopia. Objective: To assess the incidence and predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted at the prenatal care clinic of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, among pregnant women from 31 August to 2 November 2020. Participants were interviewed using Open Data Kit. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors. Result(s): Among the 464 pregnant women, 33 (7.1%) reported IPV during pregnancy, and among these 24 (72.7%) reported emotional violence, 16 (48.5%) reported sexual violence, and 10 (30.3%) reported physical violence. Among the study participants, only 8 (1.7%) were screened for IPV. IPV was reported 3.27 times more often by women who reported that their partner chewed Khat compared with those women whose partner did not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-7.38), and 1.52 times more often women who reported that their partner drank alcohol compared with those women whose partner did not (aOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.28). Conclusion(s): Very few women were screened for IPV. Partners drinking alcohol and chewing Khat are significantly positively associated with IPV during pregnancy. IPV screening should be included in the national management protocol of obstetric cases of Ethiopia.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics	false
0	Incidence of thrombotic complications and overall survival in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the second and first wave. INTRODUCTION: In the first wave, thrombotic complications were common in COVID-19 patients. It is unknown whether state-of-the-art treatment has resulted in less thrombotic complications in the second wave., METHODS: We assessed the incidence of thrombotic complications and overall mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to eight Dutch hospitals between September 1st and November 30th 2020. Follow-up ended at discharge, transfer to another hospital, when they died, or on November 30th 2020, whichever came first. Cumulative incidences were estimated, adjusted for competing risk of death. These were compared to those observed in 579 patients admitted in the first wave, between February 24th and April 26th 2020, by means of Cox regression techniques adjusted for age, sex and weight., RESULTS: In total 947 patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis, of whom 358 patients were admitted to the ICU; 144 patients died (15%). The adjusted cumulative incidence of all thrombotic complications after 10, 20 and 30 days was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-15%), 16% (13-19%) and 21% (17-25%), respectively. Patient characteristics between the first and second wave were comparable. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall mortality in the second wave versus the first wave was 0.53 (95%CI 0.41-0.70). The adjusted HR for any thrombotic complication in the second versus the first wave was 0.89 (95%CI 0.65-1.2)., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was reduced by 47% in the second wave, but the thrombotic complication rate remained high, and comparable to the first wave. Careful attention to provision of adequate thromboprophylaxis is invariably warranted. Copyright © 2021 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Immunogenic BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2. A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. We report the preclinical development of two BNT162b vaccine candidates, which contain lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived immunogens. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted, trimerised receptor-binding domain (RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation (P2 S). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the P 2S trimers are in the two-RBD 'down,' one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong TH1 CD4+ and IFNgamma+ CD8+ T-cell responses. Prime/boost vaccination of rhesus macaques with BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titres 8.2 to 18.2 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. The vaccine candidates protect macaques from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with BNT162b2 protecting the lower respiratory tract from the presence of viral RNA and with no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase 1 trials in Germany and the United States1-3. BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04380701, NCT04368728).Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.	false

We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens. This POCT detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen in saliva and would be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases	false
0	Identification of a conserved neutralizing epitope present on spike proteins from highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Three pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, with SARS-2 causing a global pandemic. While therapeutic antibodies targeting the SARS-2 spike currently focus on the poorly conserved receptor-binding domain, targeting essential neutralizing epitopes on the more conserved S2 domain may provide broader protection. We report three antibodies binding epitopes conserved on the pre-fusion MERS, SARS-1 and SARS-2 spike S2 domains. Antibody 3A3 binds a conformational epitope with ~2.5 nM affinity and neutralizes in in vitro SARS-2 cell fusion and pseudovirus assays. Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry identified residues 980-1006 in the flexible hinge region at the S2 apex as the 3A3 epitope, consistent with binding to natural and engineered spike variants. This location at the spike trimer interface suggests 3A3 prevents the S2 conformational rearrangements required for virus-host cell fusion. This work defines a highly conserved vulnerable site on the SARS-2 S2 domain and may help guide design of pan-protective spike immunogens.	false
0	Effect of different corticosteroid regimens on the outcome of patients with severe COVI19-related acute respiratory failure. Introduction: The risk/benefit ratio of corticosteroids for patients with COVID19-related acute respiratory failure has not been yet established. Objective(s): We compared the outcomes of patients receiving dexamethasone (DEXA) vs. methylprednisolone (METHYL), and the effects of rescue, short-term/high-dose pulses of glucocorticoids (BOLUS). Method(s): Consecutive patients admitted from March 1st to April 30th 2020 to the general ICU of a tertiary care hospital for COVID19 were enrolled. As per Institutional protocol, from March 1st severe cases were given DEXA; as of April 10th the protocol was modified and METHYL was suggested. On top of that, physicians were allowed to administer a 3-day course of 1000 mg/day of methylprednisolone in case of refractory hypoxemia within the first week of treatment. Result(s): We enrolled 81 consecutive patients, 69 (85%) males, age 60 +/- 10 years. At ICU admission SAPS II was 27 +/- 7 and SOFA 4 [3; 6] points. 46 patients (56.8%) received DEXA, whereas 30 (37%) had METHYL; 5 patients did not receive corticosteroids. The groups were well-matched for age, comorbidities and severity at admission. No differences were found in the duration of mechanical ventilation (11 [7; 17] vs. 11 [8; 18] days, p = 0.7021), ICU mortality (37.0 vs 43.3%, p = 0.578), incidence of VAP (47.8 vs 53.3%, p = 0.639) or bacteremia (39.0 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.829). A significantly lower number of patients who had DEXA received a rescue BOLUS (34.8 vs. 66.7%, p = 0.007). 36 patients (44.4%) received a rescue BOLUS: they were more likely to be female (25.0 vs. 7.0%, p = 0.021) and obese (38.9 vs. 8.9%, p = 0.002). Table 1 shows the outcomes of patients who did vs. those who did not receive BOLUS. Conclusion(s): we were unable to find any difference between DEXA or METHYL on the explored outcomes; high-dose BOLUS of glucocorticoids seemed to be associated with a higher duration of mechanical ventilation and a higher incidence of complications. Further, prospective investigations are needed to confirm these results. (Table Presented).	false
0	Effect of Bamlanivimab as Monotherapy or in Combination with Etesevimab on Viral Load in Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread rapidly worldwide. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective(s): To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (+/-4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Result(s): Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P =.69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P =.21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P =.16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P =.01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

0	Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Confirmed and Negative Kawasaki Disease Patients During the Pandemic in Spain. Introduction: COVID-19 has a less severe course in children. In April 2020, some children presented with signs of multisystem inflammation with clinical signs overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD), most of them requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This study aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of KD SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and negative patients during the pandemic in Spain. Material and Methods: Medical data of KD patients from January 1, 2018 until May 30, 2020 was collected from the KAWA-RACE study group. We compared the KD cases diagnosed during the COVID-19 period (March 1-May 30, 2020) that were either SARS-CoV-2 confirmed (CoV+) or negative (CoV-) to those from the same period during 2018 and 2019 (PreCoV). Results: One hundred and twenty-four cases were collected. There was a significant increase in cases and PICU admissions in 2020 (P-trend = 0.001 and 0.0004, respectively). CoV+ patients were significantly older (7.5 vs. 2.5 yr) and mainly non-Caucasian (64 vs. 29%), had incomplete KD presentation (73 vs. 32%), lower leucocyte (9.5 vs. 15.5 x 109) and platelet count (174 vs. 423 x 109/L), higher inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein 18.5vs. 10.9 mg/dl) and terminal segment of the natriuretic atrial peptide (4,766 vs. 505 pg/ml), less aneurysm development (3.8 vs. 11.1%), and more myocardial dysfunction (30.8 vs. 1.6%) than PreCoV patients. Respiratory symptoms were not increased during the COVID-19 period.

0	COVID-19 Lockdown and Self-Perceived Changes of Food Choice, Waste, Impulse Buying and Their Determinants in Italy: QuarantEat, a Cross-Sectional Study. Data about self-perceived food choice (FC) changes and their determinants during COVID-19 lockdowns are limited. This study investigated how the Italian lockdown affected self-perceived food purchases (FP), occurrence of impulse buying (IB), household food waste production (HFWP) and their determinants. A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed in May 2020, collecting an opportunistic sample of the Italian population. A total of 1865 (70% females) people were enrolled, the median age was 29 (IQR 16.0). Most of the sample increased overall FP (53.4%), food consumption (43.4%), reduced HFWP (53.7%) and halved the prevalence of IB (20.9%) compared to the period before the lockdown (42.5%). Baking ingredients, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit and chocolate had the largest sales increase by individuals, while bakery products, fresh fish and salted snacks purchases highly decreased. Increased FP was associated with the occurrence of IB (adjOR 2.48, p < 0.001) and inversely associated with not having worked during lockdown (adjOR 0.71, p = 0.003). Multivariable logistic regressions revealed occurrence of IB was associated with low perceived dietary quality (adjOR 2.22, p < 0.001), resulting at risk, according to the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ, adjOR 1.68, p < 0.001), and inversely associated with decreased HFWP (adjOR 0.73, p < 0.012). Reduced HFWP was associated with higher perceived dietary quality (adjOR 2.27, p < 0.001) and negatively associated with low score at WHO-5 Well-Being Index (adjOR 0.72, p = 0.002). The Italian lockdown highly affected FC behaviours, leading to positive and sustainable habits towards food purchase and consumption. Public health interventions are needed to keep these new positive effects and avoid negative consequences in case of future lockdowns.	false
0	Decline of humoral responses against SARS-COV-2 spike in convalescent individuals. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. Aim(s): While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment. However, whether the neutralization capacity of convalescent plasma is stabilized six weeks after symptom onset or decreases further remains unknown. Method(s): Here we performed repeated serological analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how humoral responses against the SARSCoV- 2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. Result(s): We observed that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including the receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. Summary/Conclusions: If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.	false
0	564 Comparison of clinical outcomes in pregnant women with and without COVID-19 based on disease severity. Objective: We sought to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with differing COVID-19 severity (asymptomatic versus symptomatic) to those without COVID-19 infection. Study Design: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women delivering at three hospitals in a large not-for-profit health care organization from March through July 2020. Coarsened exact matching was performed to match women with and without COVID-19 using maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at delivery, parity and institution of delivery. Women without COVID-19 infection was the reference group. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal complications: stillbirth, postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection, endometritis and ICU admission. Outcomes were examined by adjusted binomial logistic regression analysis incorporating matched weights. Result(s): Of 2,714 women who delivered at the three hospitals, 122 (4.5%) women had COVID-19 in the pregnancy. After coarsened exact matching, the study cohort included 486 women, 55 (11.3%) asymptomatic women, 36 (7.4%) symptomatic women and 395 (81.3%) women without disease. Demographic data (Table 1) showed that more Hispanic women were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease and represented the largest proportion in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Although there was an increase in the maternal composite outcome in both asymptomatic and symptomatic women compared to COVID-19 negative women, this was not statistically significant (Table 2). When compared to COVID-19 negative women, symptomatic women are more likely to be diagnosed with intraamniotic infection (aOR 5.3 95% CI [1.02-27.4]) and require ICU admission (aOR 31.9 [95% CI 2.9-344.8]. There were no statistically different neonatal outcomes. Conclusion(s): Women with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection does not lead to increased odds of overall maternal morbidity compared to women without COVID-19 in pregnancy. This can be considered reassuring information to share with women who are contemplating or are pregnant in the pandemic. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System peptide profiles in patients with COVID-19. Objective While evidence on the interface between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is accumulating, clinical data on RAAS peptide alteration among coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients is missing. Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged >=18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.	false
0	A Novel System of 'Split Ventilation' using electronically controlled valves can be used to deliver modified lung protective ventilation in a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Introduction: During surges in demand for ventilator capacity, demand may outstrip supply. Split ventilation has been suggested as a temporising measure for individual hospitals to cope with such surges in demand. Optimising split ventilation may be important in the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated high prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We developed a low cost electronically controlled system for delivering split ventilation, provisionally termed the Combiventilate system. Objective(s): 1) To demonstrate that an electronically controlled split ventilation system could be used to delivery independent volumecontrolled ventilation to two test lungs under conditions of varying resistance, compliance and leak. 2) To demonstrate that in a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the Combiventilate system could deliver independent modified lung protective ventilation. 3) To show that in a porcine model of ARDS, markers of ventilator induced lung injury were similar in Cobiventilate ventilated animals and single ventilated animals. 4) To demonstrate that with minimal training, critical care staff could independently operate the Combiventilate system in simulated clinical scenarios. Method(s): We performed benchtop testing of the Combiventilate system using linear test lungs to ensure it's ability to provide differential ventilation and accommodate for changes in respiratory mechanics. We established a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by administering intrabronchial hydrochloric acid. We compared ventilation using the Combiventialte system to traditional individual ventilation in both injured and uninjured animals (n = 30). Groups were; individually ventilated uninjured (n = 5), individually ventilated injured (n = 5), Combiventilate managed uninjured (n = 10) and Combiventilate managed injured (n = 10). We compared between group differences in the ability to deliver lung protective ventilation and meet gas exchange targets over a period of 6 hours of mechanical ventilation. We also compared immunological and histological markers of ventilator induced lung injury between groups. We performed benchtop simulations of clinical scenarios to verify that, with minimal training, clinical staff could set up and operate the Combiventilate system under conditions simulating common clinical scenarios. Result(s): The Combiventilate system was able to deliver individualised volume-controlled ventilation in benchtop testing with linear test lungs. In a porcine model of ARDS, the Combiventilate system was able to facilitate similar adherence to modified lung protective ventilation as compared to individual traditional ventilation. Immunological and histological markers of ventilator induced lung injury were similar in the Combiventilate managed groups compared to the traditionally ventilated groups. In benchtop simulations, clinical staff were able to set up and operate the Combiventilate system with minimal training. Conclusion(s): Performance of the Combiventilate system in benchtop testing and in a large animal model of ARDS supports the ability to deliver modified lung protective ventilation. Similar degrees of ventilator induced lung injury as observed in the Combiventilate group as compared to the individually ventilated group. These data are promising and support further efforts to develop and investigate this system for use in humans as a temporising measure when surge demand exceeds capacity for indivualised ventilation.	false
0	Descriptive data analysis of covid-19 among patients with multiple sclerosis; A cross-sectional study of southern Iran. Background: The managing of patients who receive immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs rapidly has to change during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Immunosuppression therapy combined with neurological disability such as multiple sclerosis (MS) increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and associated death. Hence, evaluating the risk of Covid-19 in MS patients is an important issue in global healthcare system and demand for data to describe the frequency and the evolution of COVID-19 infection in MS patients grows rapidly around the world. Objective(s): We report our descriptive-analytic study on MS patients with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This study was conducted in south of Iran, an area with a high prevalence and incidence of MS. It is also worth noting that Iran is high in prevalence of COVID- 19 and this study was performed in the first pandemic wave in Iran. Method(s): 1361 MS patients from fars province, south of Iran were contacted from April 3 to June 20, 2020. Basic demographic data, information about MS disease and any signs, symptoms or laboratory results relevant to COVID-19 were gathered. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): The frequency of DMT were as follow: rituximab 27.6%, interferons 27.3%, fingolimod 12.5%, dimethyl fumarate 9.1%, glatiramer acetate 7.3%, teriflunomide 1.9%, natalizumab 1.3%. Out of 1361 patients, 68 (5) % were COVID-19 suspected cases. 12 patients showed serious clinical symptoms and required hospital admission. 8 cases had positive PCR, 6 of confirmed cases did not require ICU care or intubation and were discharged from the hospital. 2 of the COVID-19 confirmed cases died. Both of them were on rituximab. The highest frequency of suspected cases had RRMS 87.7%, followed by PPMS7.7% and the lowest percentage of suspected cases was observed in SPMS patients 1.5%. 50% of confirmed cases and 12.5% of suspected cases were on rituximab. .There was significant difference in frequency rate of patients who used corticosteroid (p <0.005) and cardiovascular drugs (p =0.04). 62.5% of confirmed cases had EDSS 6 or higher while 6.4% of suspected and 10.1% of healthy cases requires assistance to walk. In the multivariable regression model, CVD and hyperthyroidism were independently associated with the risk of the suspect or confirmed COVID-19. Patients with hyperthyroidism and CVD were approximately 21.3 and 3.6 times higher at risk of infection.( OR=21.3 95% CL2.95-55.08 P=0.002) (OR=3.69 95% CL1.47-9.21, P=0.005) respectively. Conclusion(s): In general, risk of covid- 19 infection and severity and mortality in pwMS seems not to be more than other population; however, type of disease modifying drug, comorbidities and physical disability are the main factors which may threaten these patients. our study showed PPMS and CIS types as well as cases with hyperthyroid and cardiovascular diseases are in a higher risk than the other MS patients.	false
0	Inactivation of a broad spectrum of pathogens by photochemical treatment of plasma and platelets using Amotosalen and ultraviolet a light. Background: The INTERCEPT Blood System pathogen reduction (PR) technology using amotosalen and ultraviolet A light (UVA) was developed for the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes in plasma and platelet components. The technology has been used worldwide with kits sold to produce more than 6.9 million transfusable blood products. Aim(s): To summarize the published data describing inactivation efficacy for viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Method(s): Twenty-five enveloped and 6 non-enveloped viruses, 22 bacterial strains and 4 parasites species, were evaluated for sensitivity to amotosalen/UVA treatment. The data were obtained in studies in which high titers of pathogens were spiked into plasma or platelet concentrates (PC) resuspended in 35% plasma/ 65% platelet additive solution (PAS) or in 100% plasma. Samples harvested pre- and post-PR treatment were assessed for infectivity using culture systems and, where appropriate, animal models. Log10 reduction factors (LRF) were defined as the difference in infectious titers pre- and post-PR treatment. Result(s): Inactivation data have been obtained for 25 enveloped viruses, 6 nonenveloped viruses, 22 bacterial strains, and 4 parasites including vector-borne disease agents that have emerged over the past two decades. LRF of >= 4.0 have been claimed for 13 viruses, 19 bacterial strains, and 4 parasites in platelets in plasma/ PAS [>4.3->7], 14 viruses, 8 bacterial strains, 3 parasites in platelets in 100% plasma [>4.2 to > 7.6], and 15 viruses, 6 bacterial strains, and 3 parasites [>4.2- >10.6] in plasma. Inactivation of flaviviruses by amotosalen/UVA was demonstrated for West Nile, dengue virus, Zika (ZIKV) and yellow fever virus with LRFs > 4.0 in PCs and plasma. Inactivation of alphaviruses was demonstrated for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with LRFs > 6.4 in PC and >= 7.6 in plasma, and with LRF > 5.1 for Ross River virus and > 6.9 for Mayaro virus in PC. With the recent emergence of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV, it is important to note that LRFs >= 5.5 in plasma and > 6.2 in PC were documented for the closely related SARS-CoV, and recent investigator-initiated studies have demonstrated LRFs >= 4.5 for MERS-CoV in PC and > 4.7 in plasma. Parasites with large global impact on immunocompromised transfusion recipients demonstrated high sensitivity to PR treatment with LRFs > 6.0 in PC and >= 6.9 in plasma for P. falciparum, >5.0 in PC and plasma for T. cruzi, and > 5.3 in PC and plasma for B. microti. Beyond emerging viruses and parasites, bacteria were evaluated including 9 Gram-negative, 11 Gram-positive, and 2 spirochetes. Out of 22 evaluated bacterial strains, 21 exhibited LRF > 4.5, with LRFs > 6.0 for 18 of them. Routine-use hemovigilance data have shown that the system is efficacious to reduce septic transfusion reactions. Summary/Conclusions: The amotosalen/UVA PRT is effective at reducing infectivity levels of a broad spectrum of pathogens in plasma and PC. Industry guidelines consider INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets as an alternative to screening strategies for bacteria, ZIKV, cytomegalovirus, and parasites that cause malaria and babesia, or as an alternative to procedures such as gamma irradiation. The data here presented are of interest to inform worldwide blood safety and emerging infectious diseases (EID) preparedness programs.	false
0	Early therapy with remdesivir and antibody combinations improves COVID-19 disease in mice. Improving the standard of clinical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of single agent therapies has not been comprehensively defined over the time course of infection and it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis model, we show that single-agent therapies exert potent antiviral effects even when initiated relatively late after infection, but their efficacy is diminished as a function of time. RDV and a cocktail of two mAbs in combination provided improved outcomes compared to single agents alone extending the therapeutic window of intervention with less weight loss, decreased virus lung titers, reduced acute lung injury, and improved pulmonary function. Overall, we demonstrate that direct-acting antivirals combined with potent mAb can improve outcomes over single agents alone in animal models of COVID-19 thus providing a rationale for the coupling of therapies with disparate modalities to extend the therapeutic window of treatment.	false
0	Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibody Testing during COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation. <h4>Objective: </h4> To assess the value of using SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing to prioritize the vaccination of susceptible individuals as part of a COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan when vaccine supply is limited. <h4>Methods:</h4> A compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. <h4>Results:</h4> The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed and moves closer to the peak day. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available.	false
0	Telemedicine in International Cleft Care: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: Cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP) are among the world's most common congenital malformation and has a higher prevalence in developing nations due to environmental and genetic factors. Global efforts have been developed in order to prevent and treat the malformation. Telemedicine has been implemented in various humanitarian global missions with success and is currently the primary means of care due to COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and barriers of telehealth in the care of patients with CLP through a global approach., METHODS: Systematic review of the PubMed and Cochrane Review databases with relevant terms related to telemedicine in cleft lip and palate surgery., RESULTS: Eight articles fit the inclusion criteria and suggested benefits with the use of telemedicine in regard to education, preoperative, and postoperative care as well as increased access to underserved populations. Barriers included connectivity and accessibility concerns., CONCLUSION: Telehealth is a beneficial way to evaluate patients with CLP in developing countries with proper care and follow-up to reduce complications and to improve health outcomes.	false
0	The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses. Background: Healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, are particularly susceptible to physical and mental health consequences such as anxiety and depression. The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. Result(s): In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. Conclusion(s): This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers should be provided with resources to minimize this risk.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	"Definitions and psychological impacts of quarantine and strategies to reduce it: A review paper. Context: Worldwide outbreak of coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization as a global emergency. Quarantine, as one of the first important health measures to control and spread epidemic diseases, is the focus of health authorities and policymakers in most societies. This study was designed to obtain the psychological impact of quarantine and strategies to reduce it.

Systematic searching and screening of the titles resulted in 68 initial titles that decreased to 46 after reviewing the abstracts, and 19 articles were included in the final review. Result(s): Quarantine can lead to psychosocial problems from feeling lonely to depression and anxiety disorders. Certain counseling, as well as educational and supportive interventions, can make this situation tolerable. Conclusion(s): For acceptance and adherence to quarantine conditions, clear and transparent information about the disease and its prevalence and meeting the needs of people such as psychological, informational, and financial needs in each country are essential to reduce fear and anxiety.Copyright © 2020, Author(s)."	false
0	Does COVID-19 antibody serology testing correlate with disease severity? An analytical descriptive retrospective study. Aim: To find out if there is any correlation between COVID-19 antibody serological testing and symptom severity., Methods: This study is a case series of 44 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 who are divided into a group of 23 patients with mild disease and a group of 21 patients with severe disease. All 44 samples were confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test was performed for all patients and all patients developed neutralizing antibodies with altered range., Main outcomes: IgG level and its correlation with disease severity, demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, and treatment comparison between mild and severe disease groups., Results: Quantitative SARS COV-2 IgG was significantly higher in moderate and severe disease groups compared with those in the mild disease group. COVID-19 infection was more prevalent in male, Saudi nationals and smokers with comorbidities and higher inflammatory markers are more in the severe group than in the mild group which necessitates more management options to be taken for severe group patients., Conclusion: IgG antibody level was higher in the severe disease group. Also, the study showed significant differences between the mild and severe disease groups in terms of demographic, clinical, and management variables.

0	Consequences of COVID19-pandemic lockdown on Italian occupational physicians' psychosocial health. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Italy has been the most affected country in the world, right after China. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were among the hardest hit by this event from both a working and psychological point of view. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian Occupational Physicians' well-being and psychological distress, in relation to demographic and occupational characteristic, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey questionnaire from April 1 to April 21st, 2020. To evaluate the level of psychological distress and the level of well-being, the general Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the WHO-5 Wellbeing Index were utilized. Since the statistical assumptions were respected, we proceeded with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ascertain the differences between the averages of the scores of the GHQ-12. Doctors who live in the most affected regions have a prevalence of psychological distress higher than their colleagues from the rest of Italy. ANOVA shows significant differences relating to the female gender, and to the life changes provoked by the lockdown for example not feeling sheltered at home or suffering from loneliness. This study showed a high prevalence of psychological distress in occupational physicians. To prevent the occurrence of mental disorders among Occupational Physicians, it is urgent to put in place policies of psychological support and well-being preservation.	false
0	Characteristics of Three Different Chemiluminescence Assays for Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies. Several tests based on chemiluminescence immunoassay techniques have become available to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35 days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multigroup study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n = 145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e., healthy blood donors, n = 191, and healthcare workers, n = 1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 7), and endemic common-cold coronavirus infections (n = 12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers' cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval [84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation. Copyright © 2021 Myriam C.

Cancer patients have increased morbidity and mortality from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the underlying immune mechanisms are unknown. In a cohort of 100 cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, we found that patients with hematologic cancers had a significantly higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancers after accounting for confounders including ECOG performance status and active cancer status. We performed flow cytometric and serologic analyses of 106 cancer patients and 113 non-cancer controls from two additional cohorts at Penn and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients with solid cancers exhibited an immune phenotype similar to non-cancer patients during acute COVID-19 whereas patients with hematologic cancers had significant impairment of B cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. High dimensional analysis of flow cytometric data revealed 5 distinct immune phenotypes. An immune phenotype characterized by CD8 T cell depletion was associated with a high viral load and the highest mortality of 71%, among all cancer patients. In contrast, despite impaired B cell responses, patients with hematologic cancers and preserved CD8 T cells had a lower viral load and mortality. These data highlight the importance of CD8 T cells in acute COVID-19, particularly in the setting of impaired humoral immunity. Further, depletion of B cells with anti-CD20 therapy resulted in almost complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies, but was not associated with increased mortality compared to other hematologic cancers, when adequate CD8 T cells were present. Finally, higher CD8 T cell counts were associated with improved overall survival in patients with hematologic cancers. Thus, CD8 T cells likely compensate for deficient humoral immunity and influence clinical recovery of COVID-19. These observations have important implications for cancer and COVID-19-directed treatments, immunosuppressive therapies, and for understanding the role of B and T cells in acute COVID-19.	false
0	Can noble metal coating reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP): A multicenter double blind randomized pilot study. Introduction: Ventilator associated pneumonia is still a problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Noble metal coating of endotracheal tubes reduces the adhesion of bacteria and could reduce the incidence of VAP. Method(s): A controlled prospective randomized, double blind, multicenter study was launched in November 2018 in Liege, Belgium enrolling 324 patients from 8 ICUs from 4 sites of two hospital institutions using endotracheal tubes for ventilated patients from Bactiguard. These tubes with subglottic suctioning had, for half of them, a thin coating of noble metals (gold, silver and palladium) firmly attached to their surfaces, preventing bacteria from adhering and forming biofilm. Coated tubes were indistinguishable from control tubes. Coated and control tubes were coded and remained blinded for all the participants. Patients were followed during ventilation and ICU stay up to 28 days. Tracheal colonization, incidence of VAP, and antibiotic consumption were recorded. Result(s): The study ended on 5 March 2020 before the Covid-19 pandemic occurrence in Liege. Data are given as a whole because the code is not yet broken. This will be done before the European convention. Among the 324 patients with a median age of 67.5 (IQR 56,5- 74,6), there were 179 men (55.4%). Their mean Charlson score was 2 (IQR 1-4) and the mean saps II score, calculated the day of intubation, was 50.5 +/- 17.5. The median length of ventilation through both uncoated and coatedtubes was 5 days (IQR 3-9) totaling 2202 ventilatory days. No bacteria were found in tracheal sputum from 122 patients during ventilation. Persistence of bacteria already present in tracheal sputum the day of intubation was documented in 38 patients and new bacteria were found in 76 patients. No sampling was done in 88 patients, partially because of too short ventilation (n = 26). During ventilation and 2 days after extubation, there were 55 suspected episodes of VAP. The analysis of these episodes based on the presence of new infiltrate on X-ray exam, fever, leucocytosis, increase of the FiO2 or Peep level, quantitative bacteriological result and CRP change, leads to reject 25 suspicions and classifies the 30 other as confirmed (n = 2), probable (n = 12) or possible (n = 16). The overall incidence of VAP was 13.7/1000 ventilatory days or 9.3/100 patients. Antibiotic from any kind was used during 68.7 % of ventilatory days and 61.7% of ICU days. ICU mortality was 41.9 % and hospital mortality was 50.8%. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of a randomized double blind study with Bactiguard tubes which will allow to define the number of patients for a confirmatory larger study.	false
0	A highly effective reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of simple, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing. This study describes the validation of a new rapid SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay for use on extracted RNA or directly from swab offering an alternative diagnostic pathway that does not rely on traditional reagents that are often in short supply during a pandemic. Analytical specificity (ASp) of this new RT-LAMP assay was 100% and analytical sensitivity (ASe) was between 1 x 101 and 1 x 102 copies per reaction when using a synthetic DNA target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of RNA RT-LAMP was 97% and 99% respectively, relative to the standard of care rRT-PCR. When a CT cut-off of 33 was employed, above which increasingly evidence suggests there is a low risk of patients shedding infectious virus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100%. The DSe and DSp of Direct RT-LAMP (that does not require RNA extraction) was 67% and 97%, respectively. When setting CT cut-offs of <=33 and <=25, the DSe increased to 75% and 100%, respectively, time from swab-to-result, CT < 25, was < 15 min. We propose that RNA RT-LAMP could replace rRT-PCR where there is a need for increased sample throughput and Direct RT-LAMP as a near-patient screening tool to rapidly identify highly contagious individuals within emergency departments and care homes during times of increased disease prevalence ensuring negative results still get laboratory confirmation.Copyright © 2020	false
0	951 The association between COVID19 infection and umbilical artery dopplers in growth-restricted pregnancies. Objective: The effect of COVID19 infection on pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR) is unknown. We aim to determine whether COVID19 infection worsens the severity of fetal growth restriction as characterized by umbilical artery Doppler studies (UADs). Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered at a single New York City tertiary care center from 3/1/2020-8/12/2020 with antenatal diagnosis of FGR, defined as an estimated fetal weight<10%, abdominal circumference (AC)<5% (prior to 7/1/2020), or AC<10% (after 7/1/2020). The change in FGR definition during our study period was based on SMFM recommendations. At our institution, UADs are performed at least weekly after FGR is diagnosed. Multiple gestations and fetal anomalies were excluded. The primary exposure was antenatal diagnosis of COVID19, defined as positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab or positive COVID-19 IgG on immunoassay. The primary outcome was abnormal UADs, defined as a composite of elevated S/D ratio, absent end-diastolic velocity, or reversed end-diastolic velocity. Data were collected via chart abstraction and compared between women with normal and abnormal UADs. Result(s): 91 women met inclusion criteria. 7 (7.7%) women had COVID19 during pregnancy and 27 (29.7%) had abnormal UADs. COVID19 was diagnosed in 6 women with normal UADs and 1 with abnormal UADs (9.4% vs 4.0%, p=0.67) (Table 1). Controlling for age, race, body mass index, smoking, and maternal disease, there was no difference in abnormal UADs between COVID19 positive and negative patients (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.09-10.00). Of maternal factors evaluated, only maternal hypertensive disease of pregnancy was associated with abnormal UADs (aOR 4.68, 95% CI 1.36-16.07) (Table 2). Conclusion(s): We did not find a significant association between COVID19 infection and umbilical artery Dopplers in pregnancies affected by FGR. Maternal hypertensive disease of pregnancy may increase the risk of abnormal UADs in these pregnancies. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	565 Timing of COVID-19 during pregnancy and impact on placental pathology. Objective: To characterize the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) proximate and remote from delivery on placental pathology. Study Design: Within a prospective cohort study of pregnant women undergoing universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery, placental pathology was performed for all SARS-CoV-2 positive women over a 3-month period. Serologic testing was performed on a subset of patients for clinical or research purposes. Acute COVID-19 was defined as RT-PCR positive women with COVID-19 onset within 2 weeks of delivery, based on symptom history and/or negative serology or positive IgM only. Non-acute COVID-19 was defined as women with COVID-19 onset >2 weeks from delivery, based on symptom history, prior positive RT-PCR, and/or positive IgG serology. A subset of SARS-CoV-2 negative women whose placentas were examined for routine indications were included as negative controls in an additional analysis. Demographic, clinical, and obstetric data were abstracted from the medical record. All placentas were examined by a senior pathologist, and lesions categorized according to the Amsterdam criteria. The primary outcome was fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM); the secondary outcome was maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM). Result(s): 90 placentas were evaluated from 63 non-acute and 27 acute cases. There were no differences in clinical characteristics by exposure group (Table 1). Placentas of women with acute COVID-19 had significantly more FVM lesions compared to women with non-acute COVID-19 (51.9% vs 19.0%, p=0.004), while frequency of MVM lesions did not differ by exposure (29.6% vs 30.2%, p>0.99) (Table 2). When including 188 SARS-CoV-2 negative, control placentas, FVM lesions remained significantly more frequent among acute than either non-acute or control cases (p<0.001; data not shown). Conclusion(s): Placental pathology may differ based on the timing of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. Increased frequency of FVM during acute infection may reflect pregnancy-specific sequelae of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and the implications for maternal or neonatal thrombotic events requires further study.

0	159 Utility of universal preadmission COVID-19 testing in labor and delivery unit at local community hospital. Objective: To estimate prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant (carriers) through universal preadmission L&D screening at local community hospitals system located in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of universal COVID-19 testing in pregnant was performed at ProMedica Health care system from March to September 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19 pandemic our health care elected to follow universal preadmission L&D screening and universal use of PPE strategy aimed to protect healthcare workers and prevent spread of new coronavirus infection. It was believed that pregnant women are at higher risk for COVID-19 as compared to general population. All scheduled term pregnant patients underwent universal nasopharyngeal COVID-19 qRT-PCR 48 hours prior to delivery. Positive patients were triaged over the phone for symptoms. Positive patients were identified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical disease according to SMFM guidelines. Result(s): 2357 deliveries occurred during study timeframe, out of which 1399 pregnant patients (59.4%) were eligible for universal testing. Among 1399 pregnant who were scheduled for preadmission L&D SARS-CoV-2 screening, 1165 (83.3%) underwent testing prior to scheduled hospital admission, 202 (14.4%) delivered prior to scheduled test and 32 (2.3%) patient declined testing. Out of 1165 screened, 10 (0.9%) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Two out of 1165 (0.2%) developed mild symptoms and 8 (0.7%) were asymptomatic. 1155 (99.1%) were tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (Fig.1). Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriers among scheduled for L&D admission in ProMedica Health care system were 0.7% from March to August 2020. This carrier rate is almost similar to general population rate in Ohio (1.2%)2 and Michigan (1.2%)2 during both surges in cases (Fig. 2). Based on our small cohort, it appears that COVID-19 carrier rate is similar between pregnant and general population. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Antibody response among COVID-19 patient with and without re-detectable positive RT-PCR results in convalescent phases. <h4>Objective: </h4> To analyze the dynamic of total, IgA, IgM and IgG antibody of the confirmed COVID-19 patients during convalescent phases to understand the kinetics of antibody response among recovered patients. <h4>Methods:</h4> From March 4 to April 29, 2020, a total of 143 recovered COVID-19 patients with clear date of illness onset available were enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. Blood samples were collected for antibodies testing. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 275 blood samples up to 96 days after illness onset were collected from 143 recovered patients. High titers of total and IgG antibodies continued to persist for over 3 months, with 100% and 99.3% patients remaining positive for total and IgG antibody. IgM antibody declined rapidly with a median time to seronegative at 67 (95%CI: 59, 75) days after illness onset. Around 25% patients were seronegative for IgA antibody at month 3 after illness onset. No statistical significance difference was founded in the antibody kinetics between patients with and without re-detectable positive RT-PCR results during in convalescent phases. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Similar high antibody titers of total and IgG antibody continued to persist for over 3 months among recovered COVID-19 patients with and without re-detectable positive RT-PCR results.	false
0	Prevalence, Psychological Responses and Associated Correlates of Depression, Anxiety and Stress in a Global Population, During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic. Uncertainty and isolation have been linked to mental health problems. Uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to trigger mental health problems, which include anxiety, stress, and depression. This paper evaluates the prevalence, psychological responses, and associated correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a global population during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. 678 completed forms were collected during the COVID-19 quarantine/lockdown. An online questionnaire was designed and DASS-21 was used as the screening tool. A non-probability sampling technique strategy was applied. 50.9% of participants showed traits of anxiety, 57.4% showed signs of stress, and 58.6% exhibited depression. Stress, anxiety, and depression are overwhelmingly prevalent across the globe during this COVID-19 pandemic, and multiple factors can influence the rates of these mental health conditions. Our factorial analysis showed notable associations and manifestations of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. People aged 18-24, females, and people in non-marital relationships experienced stress, anxiety, and depression. Separated individuals experienced stress and anxiety. Married people experienced anxiety. Single and divorced people experienced depression. Unemployed individuals experienced stress and depression. Students experienced anxiety and depression. Canada, the UK, and Pakistan are all countries that are experiencing stress and depression as a whole. An extended number of days in quarantine was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Family presence yielded lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Lastly, lack of exercise was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression.	false
0	Exploratory study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general Brazilian population. The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the main international concerns regarding its impact on mental health. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and behavioral aspects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a Brazilian population. An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic. That said, it should be emphasized that these findings are preliminary and portray a moment still being faced by many people amid the pandemic and quarantine measures. Therefore, we understand that the magnitude of the impacts on mental health will only be more specific with continuous studies after total relaxation of the quarantine.	false
0	Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the coronavirus-19 disease pandemic: a population-based study. OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULT(S): The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53.6 %, with 11.6 % (95 % CI 10.6, 12.6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSION(S): Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.	false
0	Drivers of Acceptance of COVID-19 Proximity Tracing Apps in Switzerland: Panel Survey Analysis. BACKGROUND: Digital proximity tracing apps have been released to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how the acceptance and uptake of these apps can be improved. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to investigate the coverage of the SwissCovid app and the reasons for its nonuse in Switzerland during a period of increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHOD(S): We collected data between September 28 and October 8, 2020, via a nationwide online panel survey (COVID-19 Social Monitor, N=1511). We examined sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with app use by using multivariable logistic regression, whereas reasons for app nonuse were analyzed descriptively. RESULT(S): Overall, 46.5% (703/1511) of the survey participants reported they used the SwissCovid app, which was an increase from 43.9% (662/1508) reported in the previous study wave conducted in July 2020. A higher monthly household income (ie, income >CHF 10,000 or >US $11,000 vs income <=CHF 6000 or <US $6600 [reference]: odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.64), more frequent internet use (ie, daily [reference] vs less than weekly: OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85), better adherence to recommendations for wearing masks (ie, always or most of the time [reference] vs rarely or never: OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and nonsmoker status (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (ie, non-Swiss citizenship vs. Swiss [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87), and language region (French vs Swiss German [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80) were associated with a lower likelihood for app uptake. Further analysis in a randomly selected subsample (n=712) with more detailed information showed that higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were also associated with a higher likelihood for app uptake (ie, high vs low [reference] trust: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.58-6.22). The most frequent reasons for app nonuse were lack of perceived benefit of using the app (297/808, 36.8%), followed by the lack of a compatible phone (184/808, 22.8%), and privacy concerns (181/808, 22.4%). CONCLUSION(S): Eliminating technical hurdles and communicating the benefits of digital proximity tracing apps are crucial to promote further uptake and adherence of such apps and, ultimately, enhance their effectiveness to aid pandemic mitigation strategies.Copyright ©Viktor von Wyl, Marc Hoglinger, Chloe Sieber, Marco Kaufmann, Andre Moser, Miquel Serra-Burriel, Tala Ballouz, Dominik Menges, Anja Frei, Milo Alan Puhan.

0	The association of mode of location activity and mobility with acute coronary syndrome: a nationwide ecological study. Background: We aimed to study the effect of social containment mandates on ACS presentation during COVID-19 pandemic using location activity and mobility data from mobile phone map services. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) including all ACS presentations during the pandemic until 7 May 2020. Using a count regression model, we adjusted for day of the week, daily weather and incidence of COVID-19. Result(s): A 10% increase in activity around areas of residence was associated with 38% lower rates of ACS hospitalizations, whereas increased activity relating to retail and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, workplaces and mode of mobility was associated with 10-20% higher rates of ACS hospitalizations. Conclusion(s): Government policy regarding social containment mandates has important public health implications for medical emergencies such as ACS and may explain the decline in ACS presentations observed during COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Provision of acute renal replacement therapy, using three separate modalities, in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. An after action review from a UK tertiary critical care centre. Purpose: The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) amongst patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with COVID-19. In addition we aim to detail the range of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) modalities offered to these patients (including peritoneal dialysis - PD - and intermittent haemodialysis - IHD) in order to meet demand during pandemic conditions. Material(s) and Method(s): Single-centre retrospective case note review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICU. Result(s): Amongst 136 patients without a prior history of End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD), 108 (79%) developed AKI and 63% of admitted patients received RRT. Due to resource limitations the range of RRT options were expanded from solely Continuous Veno-Venous HaemoDiaFiltration (CVVHDF - our usual standard of care) to include PD (in 35 patients) and IHD (in 15 patients). During the study period the proportion of RRT provided within ICU as CVVHDF fell from 100% to a nadir of 39%. There were no significant complications of either PD or IHD. Conclusion(s): During periods of resource limitations PD and IHD can safely be used to reduce dependence on CVVHDF in select patients with AKI secondary to COVID-19.Copyright © 2021	false
0	Prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder after infectious disease pandemics in the twenty-first century, including COVID-19: a meta-analysis and systematic review. Pandemics have become more frequent and more complex during the twenty-first century. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following pandemics is a significant public health concern. We sought to provide a reliable estimate of the worldwide prevalence of PTSD after large-scale pandemics as well as associated risk factors, by a systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched the MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases to identify studies that were published from the inception up to August 23, 2020, and reported the prevalence of PTSD after pandemics including sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Poliomyelitis, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), H5N1, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 88 studies were included in the analysis, with 77 having prevalence information and 70 having risk factors information. The overall pooled prevalence of post-pandemic PTSD across all populations was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-25.4%, I2: 99.7%). Healthcare workers had the highest prevalence of PTSD (26.9%; 95% CI: 20.3-33.6%), followed by infected cases (23.8%: 16.6-31.0%), and the general public (19.3%: 15.3-23.2%). However, the heterogeneity of study findings indicates that results should be interpreted cautiously. Risk factors including individual, family, and societal factors, pandemic-related factors, and specific factors in healthcare workers and patients for post-pandemic PTSD were summarized and discussed in this systematic review. Long-term monitoring and early interventions should be implemented to improve post-pandemic mental health and long-term recovery.	false
0	Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus gene 5 modulates pathogenesis in mice. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia that emerged in 2012. There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing nonsynonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo in both humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL) or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-DELTA5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-DELTA5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-DELTA5, in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nucleotide (nt) deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Expression of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-DELTA5-infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that the rMERS-MA-DELTA5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (35%). Animal models together with reverse-genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse-genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	"The role of air conditioning in the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 in indoor environments: A first computational fluid dynamic model, based on investigations performed at the Vatican State Children's hospital. Background: About 15 million people worldwide were affected by the Sars-Cov-2 infection, which already caused 600,000 deaths. This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. Method(s): We modeled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the ""Bambino Gesu"" Vatican State Children's Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (eta) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient's mouth was also assessed. Result(s): Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 s from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient's mouth in the first 0.5 s following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the eta index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. Conclusion(s): CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc."	false
0	1161 Six month experience of universal COVID-19 screening of patients delivering at an urban academic center. Objective: During the first two weeks of the pandemic, we discovered that within our academic medical center in New York City more than 1 in 8 patients admitted for labor and delivery were COVID-19 positive without symptoms. We sought to describe rates of COVID-positivity rates among gravidas delivering over the subsequent months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: A retrospective review was conducted of SARS-COV2 PCR results among all gravidas who delivered from March 22 to Sept 12, 2020. A program of universal testing for COVID-19 began on March 22, 2020 with all patients being tested with PCR analysis for SARS-COV2 on nasopharyngeal swabs immediately before delivery admission. Electronic medical records were queried to determine date and result of all PCR tests, and symptomatology at the time of delivery swab. We created three non-mutually exclusive patient classifications. Patients with any positive PCR before or at delivery were considered 'COVID-positive'. Asymptomatic patients with no prior COVID diagnosis were considered 'Low suspicion positive'. Patients with 28 days elapsed between initial positive PCR and delivery were classified as 'COVID-recovered'. Within each week of the study period, delivery volume was tabulated as well as rates of overall positivity, low-suspicion positivity, and recovered positives were calculated. Result(s): Over the 25 week study period, 2996 patients gave birth including 294 (9.81%) with any positive SARS-COV2 PCR. Weekly rates of PCR-positivity ranged from 2.34%-22.95% (Figure 1). Over half of positives (167/294; 56.8%) were low-suspicion positives detected based on routine testing at delivery admission. Of positives, 73.47% delivered within 28-days of their initial positive result, whereas 26.53% were COVID-recovered at delivery. Conclusion(s): At the height of the pandemic at an urban academic medical center, rates of COVID-19 positivity was as high as 2 in 10. Given that half of all of our COVID-19 positive patients were asymptomatic, universal testing was vital for our obstetrical units. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-epidemiology and prevention. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread globally since December 2019. A first wave is visible up to the end of June 2020 in many regions. This article presents a review of the current knowledge on the epidemiology and prevention. The SARS-CoV-2 predominantly replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is particularly transmitted by droplets and aerosols. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5-10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts. The incidence for the first wave in Germany can be estimated as 0.4-1.8% and excess mortality could not be observed.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	false
0	Anthropogenic Infection of Cats during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to SARS-CoV that jumped the animal-human species barrier and caused a disease outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that was first described in 2019, unrelated to the commonly occurring feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is an alphacoronavirus associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has spread globally within a few months, resulting in the current pandemic. Felids have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly in the Western world, many people live in very close contact with their pet cats, and natural infections of cats in COVID-19-positive households have been described in several countries. In this review, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicine from 11 European Countries, discusses the current status of SARS-CoV infections in cats. The review examines the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and human-to-animal transmissions, including infections in domestic and non-domestic felids, as well as mink-to-human/-cat transmission. It summarises current data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in domestic cats and the results of experimental infections of cats and provides expert opinions on the clinical relevance and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats.	false
0	Clinical characteristic of covid-19 infection in pediatric: A systematic review. SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of corona virus that has been identified as a cause of COVID-19 cases. This disease is transmitted quickly, causes a global pandemic and can affect all ages, including children. In children, cases are still rare and hard to be found. Because the prevalence of events in children tends to be smaller than in adults, information about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children is still lacking. The aim of this research is to find out the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infections in children. Conducting a literature review of various scientific studies related to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children. The most common clinical symptoms found in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection are coughing, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms where these symptoms usually tend to be mild to moderate and often the symptoms are not specific or asymptomatic. Laboratory results are generally normal but the CT-Scan results show suspicion towards pneumonia in the majority cases of children.Copyright © 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications.

0	Clinical Manifestations of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients: An Integrative Review. After the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, its spread to other countries is rapidly increasing. In this integrative review, we report the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19. For this purpose, available articles on gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with COVID-19, which were reported from China, were reviewed. All reviewed articles were searched from December 11, 2019, to June 20, 2020, based on specific key words. Related findings in these articles show that the main target of COVID-19 is lung tissue, as after the virus enters the body, it mainly causes respiratory symptoms in affected patients. But in addition to respiratory symptoms, it is possible that, over time, these patients present with other symptoms, the most obvious of which are gastrointestinal symptoms. It is well documented that diarrhea and vomiting are the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As part of this report, we also look at the incidence and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in Iran. The results can be used by providers as a guideline for better management of gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients. Copyright © 2021 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.	false
0	Is HbA1c dosage relevant at gestational diabetes diagnosis outside identify a preexisting diabetes?. Background and aims: The current situation and increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes necessitates risk stratification directing limited antenatal resources to those at greatest risk. It is unclear whether HbA1c threshold has utility in predicting adverse outcomes in GDM. Furthermore, it is unknown if such an HbA1c threshold exists and/or differs among women diagnosed and treated for GDMprior to 20 week's gestation. The aims of the study were to examine the relationship of HbA1c at GDM diagnosis with adverse pregnancy outcomes and to determine if this HbA1c risk threshold differs in women diagnosed with early vs standard GDM, in a large treated cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a retrospective cohort study based on 4384 womenwithGDMin France, between 2011 and 2018.Women with risk factors were screened for GDM with a FPG at the first prenatal visit and between 24-28 weeks with a 75-g OGTT using the IADPSG criteria. Pregnant women underwent an HbA1C measurement at the time ofGDM management. We assessed the association of HbA1c with pregnancy outcomes using logistic regression models before and after adjustment in predefined risk factors of GDM. We examined the associations considering HbA1c as categorical variables using five pre-specified HbA1c classes: <=4.5%, 4.6-4.9%, 5-5.5%, 5.6-5.9% and >5.9%. The results were expressed in odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), calculated using HbA1c <= 4.5% as reference. Result(s): HbA1c was measured at a median of 25 +/- 7.5 weeks gestation. Mean baseline HbA1c was 5.2% +/-0.4. 33 % of patients were treated with insulin. 41.6% of women had at least one complication from macrosomia, SGA, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission and shoulder dystocia (defining the Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Composite). A threshold HbA1c >=5.6% identifies women with a greater need for surveillance for macrosomia (OR for 5.6-5.9 = 2.12 [CI 95%= 1.29 to 3.46]; OR for >5.9 = 2.06 [CI 95%= 1.14 to 3.70]) and cesarean (OR for 5.6-5.9 = 1.64 [CI 95% = 1.06 to 2.53] ; OR for >5.9 = 1.58 [CI 95%= 0.93 to 2.7]). It is the same for preterm delivery with a threshold HbA1c >5.9% (OR = 3.33 [CI 95% = 1.27 to 8.71]). After adjustment for GDM risk factors, we confirmed these results for macrosomia, preterm delivery (p<0.0001), and cesarean (p=0.020). HbA1c remained significant for Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Composite even after risk factor adjustment (p<0.0001). These analyses were carried out in the early GDM(diagnosed before 20 weeks gestation) and in the late GDM (after 20 weeks gestation) with similar results. Conclusion(s): Our finding suggests that a single HbA1c taken at diagnosis for gestational diabetes mellitus with risk factor may be a useful pragmatic guide to identify women at risk for adverse outcomes. These clinical approaches could dichotomized women into high- and low-risk models of care at diagnosis. In view of the evolving coronavirus pandemic, and resource constraints, it is important to propose new strategies to identify women with GDM. It could be interesting to propose at 28 weeks a combined strategy HbA1c and/or fasting glucose and/or random plasma glucose to avoid OGTT.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 in diabetic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease: A population-based study. Background: The spectrum of pre-existing renal disease is known as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. Method(s): We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. Result(s): The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was an 87.9% higher probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% higher probability of being admitted, a 101.7% higher probability of intubation and a 20.8% higher probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.Copyright © Mattioli 1885.	false
0	Cyberbullying perpetration in the COVID-19 era: An application of general strain theory. The world is currently grappling with the medical, psychological, economic, and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The existing research has rightly been focused on the medical contributions - treatment, symptoms, prevalence, etc. - which are paramount. A paucity of research has tested the psychological and behavioral consequences of COVID-19. In two cross-sectional studies of US adults, we posited that personal (e.g., being diagnosed with COVID-19) and proximal (e.g., knowing people with COVID-19) experiences with COVID-19 would be related to cyberbullying perpetration due to an increase in stress. Using path modeling, results showed that (a) personal and proximal COVID-19 experiences positively correlated with cyberbullying (Studies 1 and 2) and (b) personal COVID-19 experiences were indirectly related to cyberbullying through stress, but not proximal experiences (Study 2).	false
0	High-Quality Masks Reduce COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in the US. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19., Methods: We created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of individuals wearing masks from 0-100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered 25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas)., Results: Introduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and population-wide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR., Conclusions: Even after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above physical distancing interventions., Highlights: This paper shows the impact of widespread adoption of masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying levels of population adherence, mask efficacy, and timing of mask adoption. The paper's findings help inform messaging to policymakers at the state or local level considering adding or keeping mask mandates, and to communities to promote widespread adoption of high-quality masks.Adoption of masks by at least half of the population can reduce cumulative infections and population deaths by more than 25%, while decreasing peak prevalence by about 50%. Even greater marginal improvements arise with adoption rates above 70%. The benefits of adopting high-quality masks is above that achieved by mobility changes and distancing alone.Rural and suburban areas are at higher relative risk than urban areas, due to less distancing and lower adoption of masks.	false
0	Covid-19 in cladribine-treated patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis: A monocentric experience. Background: Cladribine significantly reduces disease activity and disability progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) through a selective but transient depletion of lymphocyte subsets. The SARS-COV-2 outbreak has raised several concerns regarding cladribine use for RRMS patients. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 disease among cladribine-treated relapsing-remitting MS patients. Method(s): Fifty-six RRMS patients treated with cladribine in our centre (female=39; mean age=33.8 years [y]; median Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]=1.5, disease duration [DD]=5.2 y, treatment duration=1.15 y) were asked if they had developed manifestations suggestive of SARS-COV-2 infection up to June 30th 2020. Their detailed characteristics were collected. Result(s): At June 30th 2020, nasal/pharyngeal swabs have been found positive in 0.94% of the Lombardy population. Since the pandemic start, 2/56 (3.6%) cladribine-treated RRMS complained a symptomatology suggestive of COVID-19 disease, with a prevalence similar to that of the whole MS population of our centre (84/2950, 2.8%). The first patient was a 30-year-old male with RRMS (DD=1.2 y, EDSS=1.5) and no comorbidities. He started cladribine on January 10th 2020. One week later, he developed fever (<37.5degree), ageusia, cough, fatigue, sputum production, sore throat, nasal congestion, shortness of breath without desaturation and conjunctivitis. The second patient is a 39-year-old female with RRMS (DD=13.2 y, EDSS=3.5), and no comorbidities. She started cladribine on February 13th 2020 and underwent the second week of the first treatment course from March 5th 2020. On March 30th, she developed fever (<37.8degree), anosmia, ageusia, cough, fatigue, and bone/joint pain. Serology for SARS-COV-2 was positive in May 2020. For both patients, blood examinations performed before and after COVID-19 disease were within normal limits. Both patients were telephone-monitored at home and completely recovered within 15 days. Conclusion(s): Only a minority of cladribine-treated RRMS patients developed a mild and self-limiting COVID-19 disease. In our cohort, this occurred in two RRMS patients within a few weeks from treatment course and the possible nadir of selective immunosuppression. Both patients recovered completely. Cladribine administration seems to be safe also in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Self-reported symptoms of mask-associated dry eye: A survey study of 3,605 people. PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread use of face masks was recommended as a key measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A marked increase in dry eye symptoms among regular mask users was reported, but the prevalence of this condition has not been described in the literature yet. The aim of this observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was to measure self-reported symptoms of mask-associated dry eye in the general population and to identify factors influencing this condition., METHODS: An anonymous online survey was distributed using Google Forms through different social media platforms., RESULTS: A total of 3,605 surveys were analysed. Of the 2,447 having symptoms, 658 (26.9 %) participants reported their symptoms were exacerbated when wearing a mask, thus 18.3 % of all participants experienced mask-associated dry eye. There was no significant association between perceived mask-associated dry eye and age, refractive correction, and pre-existing ocular discomfort, while a positive association was observed with female sex and retail work., CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of this survey showed that most people reported no change in ocular symptoms while wearing a face mask, a significant proportion reported an increase in ocular discomfort when wearing a face mask. As face masks are necessary to slow down the spread of COVID-19, it is important not to underestimate all symptoms that could discourage the population from using them. Eye care professionals should verify the presence of clinical signs in all patients complaining about mask-induced eye discomfort, and suggest methods to mitigate this condition.

0	Survival characteristics of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation in a district general hospital in East London. Introduction: There is limited evidence to guide UK based critical care management in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) despite high demand for this service. Throughout the pandemic, emerging trends and initial outcome data have been important to modifying practice. Risk factors for severe disease in the general population have been described [1] but their impact on intensive care outcome is unclear. Objective(s): This is a detailed assessment of local management and outcomes for an east London district general hospital, following the first peak of infection and aims to inform future patient care. Method(s): Adult patients (>18 years) who tested positive on PCR for COVID-19 or those with strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19, admitted to critical care for intubation and ventilation between 14/03-01/05/2020 were identified. Patients transferred to other hospitals pre-extubation, were excluded, as were four patients who remained on invasive ventilation. Epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, temporal and outcome data was collected. Continuous data was analysed with Student's t-test /Mann Whitney's U test and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria; overall there were 15 survivors. There was no significant difference in co-morbidity prevalence, however Asian ethnicity was more highly represented in nonsurvivors. Illness duration prior to hospital or critical care admission did not differ significantly, nor did time from hospital to ICU admission, during which the majority received advanced respiratory support. Preintubation PaO2/FiO2 ratio was not statistically different between survivors and non-survivors (median 78.3 vs 82.5 respectively; p = 0.584). Median ICU stay in survivors was 9.0 days (range 3.0-24.0) and hospital admission 17 days (range 11.0-35.0). CRP values were significantly higher in those who died at the initial hospital presentation (p=0.032) and ICU admission (p=0.013). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in non-survivors at both hospital admission (p=0.020) and ICU admission (p=0.0003). ICU admission D-dimer showed a trend towards higher levels in the non-survivors. Conclusion(s): The APACHE II score appears helpful in predicting COVID-19 mortality and may aid clinical decision making. Higher ICU admission CRP and neutrophil count in non-survivors may suggest a bacterial superinfection or increased pro-inflammatory response. NLR >=3.13 plus age >=50 has been proposed as a useful early indicator of severe disease [2]. Higher NLR in our non-survivors could suggest extension to its use as an early indicator of ICU mortality. Lack of significant difference in comorbidities, age, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ferritin and D dimer may suggest these indicators of more severe disease do not impact so greatly on critical care survival, though noting our sample size is small. Significantly higher noradrenaline and paralysis use, plus trend towards proning in non-survivors is likely reflective of disease severity. Patients who are from Black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are over-represented in our study, consistent with emerging national evidence [3].	false
0	Pain Symptoms in Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Literature Review. Purpose: On 11 March, 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. It brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2-14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Pain symptoms present important challenge to clinicians' diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms should be systematically summarized., Results: The virus can invade different tissues of the body and cause different pain manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory system, and patients develop sore throat, fever, cough, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms. Moreover, it infects the nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea), and cardiovascular system (eg, chest pain, palmus, and cardiac injury). The incidence rate is 1.7-33.9% for headache, 0.7-47.1% for sore throat, 1.5-61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6-17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9-14.5% for abdominal pain. In comparison with chest and abdominal pain, COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop headache, sore throat, and myalgia/arthralgia., Conclusion: Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. Therefore, the summary of pain symptoms for COVID-19 patients can help doctors improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with atypical or mild symptoms and adopt more targeted treatment methods.

0	Inhibition of the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells by the FDA-approved drug chlorpromazine. Introduction: Urgent action is needed to fight the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by reducing the number of infected cases, contagiousness and severity. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an antipsychotic from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The aim of this in-vitro study was to test CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey and human cells. Material(s) and Method(s): Monkey VeroE6 cells and human alveolar basal epithelial A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of various concentrations of CPZ. Supernatants were harvested at day 2 and analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cell viability was assessed in non-infected cells. Result(s): CPZ was found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey VeroE6 cells, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8.2 microM, half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 13.5 microM, and selectivity index (SI) of 1.65. In human A549-ACE2 cells, CPZ was also found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with IC50 of 11.3 microM, CC50 of 23.1 microM and SI of 2.04. Discussion(s): Although the measured SI values are low, the IC50 values measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosages used in routine clinical practice because of the high biodistribution of CPZ in lungs and saliva. Also, the distribution of CPZ in brain could be of interest for treating or preventing neurological and psychiatric forms of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): These preclinical findings support clinical investigation of the repurposing of CPZ, a drug with mild side effects, in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Dosing of thromboprophylaxis and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Introduction: A substantial proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop thromboembolic complications (ref 1-3). It is unclear what the optimal dose of thromboprophylaxis is for critically ill COVID- 19 patients and whether higher doses are associated with lower mortality rates. Objective(s): To evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method(s): This was an observational cohort study in a 600-bed emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two ICUs in March and April 2020 were eligible. Exclusion criteria were short length of stay, ongoing anticoagulation therapy due to diagnosed thromboembolic disease, or no initial thromboprophylaxis in the ICU. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose; low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium ( > 4500 IU but < 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or > 5000 IU but < 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose thromboprophylaxis (>= 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or >= 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). The three study groups reflected a gradual increase in dose of thromboprophylaxis during the study period. Result(s): A total of 152 patients were included, out of which 67 received low dose thromboprophylaxis, 48 medium dose thromboprophylaxis, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Demographic andclinical characteristics were similar in the three groups at baseline. Mortality was lower in patients treated with high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%), p = 0.02. The multivariable hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.13-0.87) with high vs low dose thromboprophylaxis when adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III and invasive respiratory support. There were fewer thromboembolic events in patients treated with high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%), p = 0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p = 0.16. Conclusion(s): Among critically ill Covid-19 patients, high dose thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of death and a lower cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events compared with lower doses. There was no difference in the proportions of bleeding events between the groups. (Table Presented).	false
0	The Impact of Halting Elective Admissions in Anticipation of a Demand Surge Due to the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: In anticipation of a demand surge for hospital beds attributed to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) many US states have mandated that hospitals postpone elective admissions. OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate excess demand for hospital beds due to COVID-19, the net financial impact of eliminating elective admissions in order to meet demand, and to explore the scenario when demand remains below capacity. RESEARCH DESIGN: An economic simulation to estimate the net financial impact of halting elective admissions, combining epidemiological reports, the US Census, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the National Inpatient Sample. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored the results while varying assumptions for demand and capacity. SUBJECTS: Inputs regarding disease prevalence and inpatient utilization were representative of the US population. Our base case relied on a hospital admission rate reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 137.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (378.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (207.4 per 100,000). On average, elective admissions accounted for 20% of total hospital admissions, and the average rate of unoccupied beds across hospitals was 30%. MEASURES: Net financial impact of halting elective admissions. RESULT(S): On average, hospitals COVID-19 demand for hospital bed-days fell well short of hospital capacity, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net financial impact of a 90-day COVID surge on a hospital was only favorable under a narrow circumstance when capacity was filled by a high proportion of COVID-19 cases among hospitals with low rates of elective admissions. CONCLUSION(S): Hospitals that restricted elective care took on a substantial financial risk, potentially threatening viability. A sustainable public policy should therefore consider support to hospitals that responsibly served their communities through the crisis.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Clinical outcomes among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic covid-19 patients in an isolation facility in Chennai, India. Globally, India has reported the third highest number of COVID-19 cases. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, witnessed a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting in the establishment of isolation facilities named COVID Care Center (CCC). In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients. Older symptomatic patients with comorbidities and a high NLR admitted in an isolation facility must be frequently monitored for prompt identification of clinical progression and referral to higher center for advanced medical care.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant with non-respiratory manifestations: a case report. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents in children usually with less severe manifestations than in adults. Although fever and cough were reported as the most common symptoms, children can have non-specific symptoms. We describe an infant with aplastic anemia as the main manifestation. Case presentation: We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant without any respiratory symptoms or signs while manifesting principally with pallor and purpura. Pancytopenia with reticulocytopenia was the predominant feature in the initial laboratory investigations, pointing to aplastic anemia. Chest computed tomography surprisingly showed typical findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection was later confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): Infants with COVID-19 can have non-specific manifestations and a high index of suspicion should be kept in mind especially in regions with a high incidence of the disease. Chest computed tomography (CT) and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR may be considered even in the absence of respiratory manifestations.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Cardiac function and cor pulmonale on mechanical ventilated Covid-19 patients. A multicenter observational study. Introduction: Cardiac injury has been reported to be a major complication associated to COVID-19, with reported incidences ranging from 7 to 28% patients (1, 2). It has even been associated with increased mortality(1). Circulatory failure due to cardiogenic shock or fulminant myocarditis has been described in some case reports (3). It has been reported that 95% of COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation require norepinephrine (NE)(4), nonetheless, no systematic data have been reported about the hemodynamic profiles, cardiac function, or incidence of acute cor pulmonale (ACP), in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Objective(s): To perform a systematic characterization of cardiac function in COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients using critical care echocardiography. Method(s): The echocardiographic group of Sociedad Chilena de Medicina Intensiva (SOCHIMI) prospectively included COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation. A comprehensive echocardiographic assessment has been done within the first 12 hours of mechanical ventilation in four University Hospitals of Santiago. Result(s): 60 patients were consecutively included. The mean age was 58+/-12 y.o., 42 (70%) were male. APACHE II was 13+/-4 and SOFA 6+/-2. Forty seven (78%) patients required low doses of NE (0.05 +/- 0.06 mcg/ kg/min), median cardiac output was 4.9 [IQR 4.4-6.1] L min-1 and Lactate was 1.4 [1.0-1.9] mmol/L. Forty three (72%) patients exhibited a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >60% (hyperkinetic), 16 patients had LVEF between 45 and 60% (normokinetic) and one patients had hypokinetic heart function (LVEF <45%)(6). Right ventricle function was preserved in 55 (92%) patients (TAPSE >17 m)(7). In eighteen patients (30%) mild right ventricle dilation (right to left ventricular area ratio between 0.6-0.8) was observed and four (7%) patients exhibited moderate acute cor pulmonale (right to left ventricular area ratio between >0.8). In addition, no correlation was observed between LVEF and troponin levels. Echocardiography (Table Presented).parameters are shown in the Table. Conclusion(s): The most frequent hemodynamic profile of mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was a normodynamic circulatory state with hyperkinetic cardiac performance, associated with normal intravascular volume and normal tissue perfusion. In contrast with usual ARDS, severe acute cor pulmonale was not observed in this COVID-19 patient series. Although some cases of circulatory failure have been described, our data suggest that cardiac dysfunction is not a frequent feature of COVID-19. Further studies are necessary to assess the dynamic changes in cardiac performance over time.	false
0	Emergency high ligation in a suspected COVID-19 pediatric patient with incarcerated inguinal hernia: A case report. Background: SARS-Cov-2 infects not only adults, but also children, including pediatric surgery patients with acute abdomen. Here, we report a pediatric surgery case with incarcerated inguinal hernia and suspected COVID-19., Case presentation: A 11-month-old male was brought to our emergency department with the main complaint of recurrent yellowish-green vomiting that was experienced from one day before admission. High fever and shortness of breath were also reported. This patient was also suffering from moderate dehydration. Neither history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 nor traveling from any local transmission area were found. However, a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test revealed a positive result. A lump in the left scrotum that persisted during admission was found. Fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement for decompression was performed. Manual reduction was attempted but failed to reduce the lump. Accordingly, we decided to perform an emergency high ligation using tertiary protection regulations, i.e., full personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19. Intraoperatively, we found a small intestine loop trapped in the scrotum and stuck in the inguinal canal. Postoperatively, the baby was continued to be managed as a patient with COVID-19 while waiting for the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results., Discussion: Manual reduction is standard treatment for incarcerated inguinal hernia in children. The successful rate of manual reduction is about 70%, therefore, if the manual reduction fails, an emergency surgery is mandatory.During the COVID-19 pandemic, all medical procedures require clarity of the patient's status including whether infected with COVID-19. Along with proper precautions, great care must be taken during surgery to minimize the risk of cross infection to health workers., Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of cross-transmission from the patient, since children are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. When and wherever possible, surgeons should perform the procedure in the quickest and most effective manner to shorten exposure time with patient and anesthetic aerosols as well as using appropriate PPE.

0	"Sudden olfactory loss as an early marker of COVID-19: a nationwide Italian survey. Purpose: The presence of many asymptomatic COVID-19 cases may increase the risks of disease dissemination, mainly for physicians. There are numerous reports on the frequent findings of sudden anosmia or hyposmia, before or at the same time of the typical COVID-19 symptoms onset. The aim of this study was to verify the association of olfactory impairment and COVID-19, providing a basis for subsequent research in the field of COVID-19 clinical heterogeneity. Method(s): We developed a 15-item online questionnaire on ""Sudden Olfactory Loss (SOL) and COVID-19"" that was administered during March 2020 to Italian general practitioners registered to a social media group. Result(s): One hundred and eighty responses were received. SOL was identified as a significant sign of infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly aged between 30 and 40 years, even in the absence of other symptoms. SOL was present as an initial symptom in 46.7% of subjects, and in 16.7%, it was the only symptom. Among the COVID-19 confirmed cases, SOL occurred as the only symptom in 19.2% of patients. Conclusion(s): SOL could represent a possible early symptom in otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects. Subjects affected by SOL should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases.

0	Convalescent plasma for COVID-19 complicated by ARDS due to TRALI. Convalescent plasma, which contains antibodies from recovered individuals, has been used as an effective treatment for infectious diseases in the past and is currently being used as a potential treatment option for COVID-19. Multiple studies have reported this treatment to be safe. We report a case of a patient who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with features suggestive of transfusion-related acute lung injury after being treated with convalescent plasma for COVID-19. We emphasise the need to be aware of the potential risk of transfusion reactions and disease worsening with convalescent plasma administration and to weigh the risk and benefits of this therapy before administration to patients and propose that further study be done regarding the potential risks of convalescent plasma.

0	SARS-CoV-2 associated neuromyelitis optica. Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause numerous neurologic sequelae, including meningoencephalitis, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Following respiratory symptoms, acute transverse myelitis has also been reported. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a rare, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord. We report a case of NMO occurring in a patient who initially presented with acute meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology and, shortly thereafter, was found to be SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. Objective(s): NMO is a rare demyelinating disorder of the CNS. Some studies of NMO have suggested a triggering role for infectious agents, but the primary immunizing event remains poorly understood. Here we describe a case of NMO presenting in a SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patient after an initial hospitalization for meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology. Method(s): The case report was compiled using outside hospital and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital electronic medical record data. Figures were obtained through PACS and formatted in Microsoft Powerpoint. Result(s): NMO is diagnosed by the presence of at least 1 of 6 core clinical characteristics and detection of AQP4-IgG. The core clinical characteristics implicate 6 CNS regions including optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema of the dorsal medulla, brainstem, diencephalon, or cerebrum. Our patient had 2 core clinical characteristics including spinal cord lesion spanning greater than 3 segments and area postrema syndrome due to dorsal medullary lesion. Furthermore, his serum AQP4-IgG was positive. He developed these symptoms after becoming seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test. Conclusion(s): This is the first case report about NMO potentially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. While causality remains difficult to prove, the temporal relationship between SARSCoV- 2 infection and NMO attack is compelling for parainfectious phenomenon.	false
0	Vaccines are not yet a silver bullet: The imperative of continued communication about the importance of COVID-19 safety measures. COVID-19 vaccines are by no means a silver bullet. With more COVID-19 vaccines expecting approval in the coming months, it is necessary to note that vaccine availability does not equate to vaccine accessibility, nor vaccine efficacy. Some research suggests that approximately 9 out of 10 individuals living in lower-income countries will not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until 2023 or later. For higher-income countries, such as the United States, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy may further compound the situation. These insights combined, in turn, emphasize the fact that even though COVID-19 vaccines are becoming more available, safety measures (e.g., face masks, personal hygiene, and social distancing) are still of pivotal importance in protecting personal and public health against COVID-19. Furthermore, this paper argues for the continued imperative for health experts and government officials to communicate and emphasize the importance of COVID-19 safety measures with the public, to make sure people are protected against COVID-19 till the pandemic ceases to pose a threat to personal or public health.

0	Chest ct evaluation of 11 persistent asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 11 asymptomatic carriers who underwent nasal or oropharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 after being in close contact with patients who developed symptomatic 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were enrolled in this study. The chest multidetector computed tomography (CT) images of the enrolled patients were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The findings of the first chest CT were normal in 3 (27.3%) patients, 2 of whom were aged below 15 years. The lesions of 2 (18.2%) patients involved 1 lobe with unifocal presence. Subpleural lesions were observed in 7 (63.6%) patients. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the most common sign observed in 7 (63.6%) patients. Crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were detected in 2 (18.2%) and 4 (36.4%) patients, respectively. Based on deep learning and quantitative analysis, the mean volume of intrapulmonary lesions in the first CT image was 85.73 +/- 84.46 cm3. In patients with positive findings on CT images, the average interval between positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay and peak volume on CT images was 5.1 +/- 3.1 days. In conclusion, typical CT findings can be detected in over 70% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The initial presentation is typically GGO along the subpleural regions and bronchi, which absorbs in approximately 5 days.Copyright © 2021, National Institute of Health. All rights reserved.	false
0	Evaluation of osseointegration and crestal bone loss associated with implants placed in diabetic and other medically compromised patients. Diabetes and other medically compromising diseases may affect people in many ways. Missing teeth can be replaced by various methods including dental implants. The stability, a more natural appearance, and minimizing the risk of bone resorption attribute to its direct anchor into bones. Nevertheless, diabetic patients may experience failure of implant placement due to microvascular complications that lead to sluggish healing after surgery. In addition, some medications are believed to impair bone healing, thus compromising dental implant success. This paper evaluates osse-ointegration and crestal bone loss of implants placed in medically compromised patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using patient records from Department of Prosthodontics, Saveetha Dental College, Chennai, from June 2019 to March 2020. Patients who had dental implants and were medically compromised were chosen randomly. Data were collected and then subjected to statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics analysis was done to find the correlation between crestal bone loss and medically compromised individuals. Microsoft Excel 2016 data spreadsheets were used to collect data, which were later exported to SPSS. Among 89 patients, more than 60% experienced crestal bone loss following implant placement. Diabetic patients recorded the highest prevalence of bone loss in comparison to other medically compromised patients. A significant association was found between crestal bone loss and diabetic patients (p < 0.05) Patients whose diseases were under control with medication were also observed to have bone loss. Overall, the prevalence of crestal bone loss seems to be higher in diabetic patients compared to other medically compromised patients. There seems to be definite correlation between diabetes and crestal bone loss.Copyright © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.	false

The REIN registry is a national registry held by the French Biomedicine Agency. Its objective is the epidemiological monitoring of patients with end-stage chronic renal failure. This registry, backed by its expertise and its national network, has been able to very quickly set up epidemiological monitoring of chronic dialysis and/or transplant patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. The first results show a relatively low frequency of COVID-19 in dialysis patients (4.9%) contrary to what one might have feared. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant patients is 1.8% nationwide. All regions of France have not been affected in the same way. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients varied by region, reaching up to 10%. The probability of being affected was higher in men and diabetic patients. At October 19, among 3209 infected patients (dialysis and transplant), 573 died from a cause related to SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality in diagnosed cases was 18%. A weekly newsletter has been set up by the Biomedicine Agency using information transmitted by all of the epidemiological support units in the registry. The REIN registry was able to adapt to become a reactive health monitoring tool. Copyright © 2021 Societe francophone de nephrologie, dialyse et transplantation. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

0	Evaluation of Hypertriglyceridemia in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Receiving Propofol. Objectives: To report the prevalence of, and evaluate risk factors for, the development of hypertriglyceridemia (defined as a serum triglyceride level of > 400 mg/dL) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received propofol., Design: Single-center, retrospective, observational analysis., Setting: Brigham and Women's Hospital, a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA., Patients: All ICU patients who with coronavirus disease 19 who received propofol between March 1, 2020, and April 20, 2020., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: The major outcome of this analysis was to report the prevalence of, and risk factors for, the development of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with coronavirus disease 19 who received propofol. Minor outcomes included the development of acute pancreatitis and description of propofol metrics. Of the 106 patients that were included, 60 (56.6%) developed hypertriglyceridemia, with a median time to development of 46 hours. A total of five patients had clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis, with one patient having confirmatory imaging. There was no difference in the dose or duration of propofol in patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia compared with those who did not. In the patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia, 35 patients (58.5%) continued receiving propofol for a median duration of 105 hours. Patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia had elevated levels of inflammatory markers., Conclusions: Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly observed in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received propofol. Neither the cumulative dose nor duration of propofol were identified as a risk factor for the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Due to the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in this patient population, monitoring of serum triglyceride levels should be done frequently in patients who require more than 24 hours of propofol. Many patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia were able to continue propofol in our analysis after reducing the dose. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Selection, Identification, and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Resistant Mutants. The use of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (mNAbs) is being actively pursued as a viable intervention for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While highly potent mNAbs have great therapeutic potential, the ability of the virus to mutate and escape recognition and neutralization of mNAbs represents a potential problem in their use for the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2. Studies investigating natural or mNAb-induced antigenic variability in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, and their effects on viral fitness, are still rudimentary. In this manuscript we described experimental approaches for the selection, identification, and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody resistant mutants (MARMs) in cultured cells. The ability to study SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift under selective immune pressure by mNAbs is important for the optimal implementation of mNAbs for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. This will help to identify essential amino acid residues in the viral S glycoprotein required for mNAb-mediated inhibition of viral infection, to predict potential natural drift variants that could emerge upon implementation of therapeutic mNAbs, as well as vaccine prophylactic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to assess MARM viral fitness and potential to induce severe infection and associated COVID-19 disease.

0	Social stigmatisation among COVID-19 patients: Addressing a potential source of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare staff in cardiac emergency and cardiac care units. During our routine work, we noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses among patients in the cardiac unit, which led to an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases among hospital staff. We found that patients hid their symptoms from the emergency doctors and attributed those symptoms to cardiac or other causes. Social stigmatisation appeared to be the root cause for hiding their symptoms. Hence, we recommended a strategy to introduce psychological counselling of patients who were suspected to be infected with COVID-19, with a normal cardiac workup to overcome social stigmatisation and save our general wards from COVID-19.

0	Serological Profile Of Specific Antibodies Against Dominant Antigens Of SARS-CoV-2 In Chilean COVID-19 Patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has been a pandemic since March 2020. Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.	false
0	Single Dose Vaccination in Healthcare Workers Previously Infected with SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages have led some experts and countries to consider untested dosing regimens. We studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers (HCW) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and compared to them to antibody responses of HCW who were IgG negative to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HCW with prior COVID-19 showed clear secondary antibody responses to vaccination with IgG spike binding titers rapidly increasing by 7 days and peaking by days 10 and 14 post-vaccination. At all time points tested, HCW with prior COVID-19 infection showed statistically significant higher antibody titers of binding and functional antibody compared to HCW without prior COVID-19 infection (p<.0001for each of the time points tested). In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identified, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.	false
0	Decreased serum levels of the inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with clinical non-response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p = 0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p = 0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.	false
0	Genetic and structural basis for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by a two-antibody cocktail. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an urgent need to understand the molecular basis for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigenic sites. To define the genetic and structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 1 , which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. COV2-2196 forms an “aromatic cage” at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals 1–4 . The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions. These studies reveal germline-encoded antibody features enabling recognition of the RBD and demonstrate the activity of a cocktail like AZD7442 in preventing escape from emerging variant viruses.	false
0	Large Scale Profiling of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients Identified Potential Therapeutic Host Targets and Drug Candidates for COVID-19. Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and rising death toll of COVID-19 in the current absence of effective treatments, it is imperative that therapeutics are developed and made available to patients as quickly as possible. Publicly available COVID-19 patient data can be used to identify host therapeutic targets, tailoring treatments to the disease signatures observed in patients. In this study, we identify potential host therapeutic targets based on gene expression alterations observed in COVID-19 patients. We analyzed RNAseq data from airway samples of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls to detect significantly differentially expressed genes and pathways that present potential therapeutic targets. Our analysis revealed expression changes in key genes involved in activation of immune pathways, as well as genes targeted by SARS-CoV2 to interfere with normal host cell functioning. Critical changes were observed in a number of genes, including EIF2AK2, which was shown to play important roles in activating the interferon response and interfering with host cell translational machinery in SARS-CoV-2 infection, presenting a prospective therapeutic target. We also identified drugs with potential to modulate multiple therapeutic targets within the most significant pathways. Our results both validate key genes, pathways, and drug candidates that have been reported by other studies and suggest others that have not been well-characterized and warrant further investigation by future studies. Further investigation of these therapeutic targets and their drug interactions may lead to effective therapeutic strategies to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic and protect against future outbreaks.<br>	false
0	Acute Limb Ischemia in a Peruvian Cohort Infected by COVID-19. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can cause alterations in the coagulation mechanism conditioning thrombotic phenomena such as acute limb ischemia (ALI) as the only manifestation of the infection. The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru. Method(s): A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six general hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution, and discharge conditions. Result(s): Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60 +/- 15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93.2% of patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients, and amputation (primary and secondary) was performed in 30% of the patients. The mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion(s): ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation. We report a younger cohort than those described in other studies and with a high frequency of amputations despite adequate surgical treatment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Liver injury in critically ill ECMO patients with COVID-19: A case series. Introduction: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a rapidly spreading pandemic. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has become a rescue therapy for some refractory critically ill patients. COVID-19 studies to date showed that patients with abnormal liver tests are at higher risk of progressing to severe disease1,2,3. ECMO patients being the most critically unwell patients, we have used our case series of all patients with COVID-19 on ECMO admitted to the intensive care unit to describe the dysfunction of blood liver tests and some potential causes. Method(s): We included into our case series a total of 18 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing VA/VV/VAV ECMO as rescue therapy at a university-affiliated tertiary care centre from March 1st to May 28th 2020. Liver test abnormalities were defined as the elevation of the following liver enzymes in serum: ALT >40 U/L, AST >40 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) >49 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) >135 U/L, and total bilirubin (TBIL) >17.1 lmol/L. Patients who had raised ALT and/or AST more than 3x the upper limit unit of normal (ULN) were classified as hepatocyte type; patients who had raised ALP or GGT twice the ULN were classified as cholangiocyte type; and patients who had a combination of both ALT/AST elevated more than 3x the ULN and ALP/ GGT twice the ULN were classified as mixed type. Result(s): Of the 18 patients mean age was 47.5(27-59)years with 94% being male.100% had abnormal liver results. No patient had documented liver disease prior to hospitalization. Average BMI was 30.4,64% having pre-existing T2DM and 52% having essential hypertension. Average APACHE2 Scores was 19[6-32]. 88% commenced VVECMO, 12% VA-ECMO with average duration of 30.4 days. 23% had a hepatocellular picture, 13% cholangiocyte, 11% mildly raised LFTs and 43% a mixed type picture. 83% had preserved synthetic function. On examination of causes, 70% had normal echocardiography, 11% global biventricular failure and 19% mild-moderately impaired RV function. 70.5% patients were on pipercillin/tazobactum, 47% clarithromycin, 41% co-amoxiclav 23% levofloxacin, 11.7% had oseltamivir at the time of the liver injury. 5% (1 patient) was on parenteral nutrition. 11.7% had documented fatty liver on US during their ICU stay. Mortality was 11.7%. Ferritin levels were wide ranging [390-38,000] with mean of 5800 and median of 3100. Average platelets count 150 x109/L. Conclusion(s): From previous studies, we know those who had abnormal liver test results, especially in hepatocyte type or mixed type, had significantly higher risks of developing severe disease secondary to SARS-CoV-2 3. 100% of our patients had abnormal liver tests while requiring ECMO representing the most critically unwell SARS-CoV-2 population.Mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocyte picture was the most prevalent at 43%, as seen in previous studies4 with no correlation between type of liver dysfunction and mortality.The liver dysfunction in our study was higher than previously reported3,4 and with no previous history of underlying liver disease, suggesting that liver damage in patients with coronavirus infection might be directly caused by the viral infection of liver cells as suggested by previous studies due to SARS-CoV-2 might directly binding to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function5. It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. There was no direct correlation appreciated between antimicrobials and liver dysfunction in our population.In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill3. Ferritin levels were wide ranging [390-38,000] with mean of 5800 suggesting systemic inflammatory process. High positive end expiratory pressure and aggressive ventilator strategies can cause RV strain/ pressure overload. While our patients had reduced ventilation on ECMO 33% had RV dysfunction. This right ventricular dysfunction can be associated with severe hepatic congestion. The primary pathophysiology involved in hepatic dysfunction is either passive congestion from increased filling pressures or low cardiac output and the consequences of impaired perfusion.Cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis may ensue compounding the insult6. It is important to identify RV strain on echo and avoid precipitating factors such as fluid overload and aggressive ventilation. Early consideration for extracorporeal support is important in these patients to avoid RV failure from medical management of respiratory failure. Our case series suggests that there might be concomitant liver injury as a consequence of the critical illness or than direct viral damage on the hepatocytes C19. Attention to modifiable factors and further research into liver injury in SARS-CoV-2 is key with the emphasis on clinical management of these severely ill patients that may consequently impact on liver function.	false
0	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be safe for COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) administration to hypertension patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced pneumonia., METHODS: We recorded the recovery status of 67 inpatients with hypertension and COVID-19 induced pneumonia in the Raytheon Mountain Hospital in Wuhan during February 12, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Patients treated with ACEI or ARBs were categorized in group A (n = 22), while patients who were not administered either ACEI or ARBs were categorized into group B (n = 45). We did a comparative analysis of various parameters such as the pneumonia progression, length-of-stay in the hospital, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (Cr), and creatine kinase (CK) between the day when these patients were admitted to the hospital and the day when the treatment ended., RESULTS: These 67 hypertension cases counted for 33.17% of the total COVID-19 patients. There was no significant difference in the usage of drug treatment of COVID-19 between groups A and B (p > 0.05). During the treatment, 1 case in group A and 3 cases in group B progressed from mild pneumonia into severe pneumonia. Eventually, all patients were cured and discharged after treatment, and no recurrence of COVID-2019 induced pneumonia occurred after the discharge. The length of stays was shorter in group A as compared with group B, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in other general parameters between the patients of the groups A and B on the day of admission to the hospital (p > 0.05). The ALT, CK, and Cr levels did not significantly differ between groups A and B on the day of admission and the day of discharge (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: To treat the hypertension patients with COVID-19 caused pneumonia, anti-hypertensive drugs (ACEs and ARBs) may be used according to the relative guidelines. The treatment regimen with these drugs does not need to be altered for the COVID-19 patients.	false
0	"A 10-Minute ""Mix and Read"" Antibody Assay for SARS-CoV-2. Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and help examine vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-min ""mix and read"" assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."	false

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) particularly in mechanically ventilated adults with severe pneumonia. The extremely high prevalence of DVT in the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been established between 25 and 84% based on studies including systematic duplex ultrasound of the lower limbs when prophylactic anticoagulation was systematically administrated. DVT prevalence has been shown to be markedly higher than in mechanically ventilated influenza patients (6-8%). Unusually high inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype represents a striking feature of COVID-19 patients, as reflected by markedly elevated reactive protein C, fibrinogen, interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII. Moreover, in critically ill patients, venous stasis has been associated with the prothrombotic phenotype attributed to COVID-19, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Venous stasis results among others from immobilization under muscular paralysis, mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, and pulmonary microvascular network injuries or occlusions. Venous return to the heart is subsequently decreased with increase in central and peripheral venous pressures, marked proximal and distal veins dilation, and drops in venous blood flow velocities, leading to a spontaneous contrast ""sludge pattern"" in veins considered as prothrombotic. Together with endothelial lesions and hypercoagulability status, venous stasis completes the Virchow triad and considerably increases the prevalence of DVT and PE in critically ill COVID-19 patients, therefore raising questions regarding the optimal doses for thromboprophylaxis during ICU stay.

0	Distorted chemosensory perception and female sex associate with persistent smell and/or taste loss in people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: A community based cohort study investigating clinical course and resolution of acute smell and/or taste loss in people. <h4>Background: </h4> Loss of smell and/or taste are cardinal symptoms of COVID-19. ‘Long-COVID’, persistence of symptoms, affects around one fifth of people. However, data regarding the clinical resolution of loss of smell and/or taste are lacking. We assessed COVID-19 symptoms in a community cohort in London 4-6 weeks after they initially reported acute loss of their sense of smell and/or taste, 78% of whom had SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. In addition, to assess whether self-reported change in sense of smell was reliable, we compared subjective and objective smell assessments in a subset of participants. <h4>Methods: </h4> 467 participants with acute loss of smell and/or taste who had undergone SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody testing 4-6 weeks earlier completed a follow-up questionnaire about resolution of their symptoms. A subsample of 50 participants completed an objective olfactory test and results were compared to subjective smell evaluations. <h4>Results: </h4>: People with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with an acute loss of sense of smell and taste were significantly less likely to recover their sense of smell/taste than people who were seronegative (smell recovery: 57.7% vs. 72.1% , p=0.027. taste recovery 66.2% vs. 80.3%, p=0.017). In SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, a higher percentage of male participants reported full resolution of smell loss (72.8% vs. 51.4%; p<0.001) compared to female participants, who were almost 2.5-times more likely to have ongoing smell loss after 4-6 weeks (OR 2.46, 95%CI 1.47-4.13, p=0.001). Female participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and unresolved smell loss and unresolved taste loss were significantly older (>40 years) than those who reported full resolution. Participants who experienced parosmia reported lower smell recovery rates and participants with distorted taste perception lower taste recovery rates. Parosmia had a significant association to unresolved smell loss (OR 2.47, 95%CI 1.54-4.00, p<0.001). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Although smell and/or taste loss are often transient manifestations of COVID-19, 42% of participants had ongoing loss of smell, 34% loss of taste and 36% loss of smell and taste at 4-6 weeks follow-up, which constitute symptoms of ‘long-COVID’. Females (particularly >40 years) and people with a distorted perception of their sense of smell/taste are likely to benefit from prioritised early therapeutic interventions.

0	Home was not a safe haven: women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. Background: Emergency situations, including epidemics, increase incidence of violence against women, especially intimate partner violence (IPV). This paper describes specific scenarios of IPV reported by women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria to provide insight for policy and programmatic efforts. Method(s): This paper draws on seven de-identified case reports from organisations serving women experiencing IPV as well as media coverage of IPV cases in Nigeria, between April and May, 2020. Result(s): In most cases, reports identified IPV that was occurring prior to the lockdown, but increased in severity or involved new types of violence during the lockdown. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. Several women also reported threats of being thrown out of their homes by perpetrators, which threatens women's ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19, but could also leave women stranded with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women's income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women's social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. Conclusion(s): The lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women's security and ability to protect themselves from the virus. Hence, there is need for innovative approaches to support victims, with emphasis on ways in which perpetrators of IPV may be using the threat of COVID-19 to further gain power and control over partners.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Newborn antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detected in cord blood after maternal vaccination. <h4>Background: </h4> Maternal vaccination for Influenza and TDaP have been well studied in terms of safety and efficacy for protection of the newborn by placental passage of antibodies. Similar newborn protection would be expected after maternal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). There is a significant and urgent need for research regarding safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Here, we report the first known case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination. Case presentation: A vigorous, healthy, full-term female was born to a COVID-19 naive mother who had received a single dose of mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 three weeks prior to delivery. Cord blood antibodies (IgG) were detected to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 at time of delivery. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Here, we report the first known case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination.	false
0	Multi-specific DARPin® therapeutics demonstrate very high potency against mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 100 million people globally, and continues to undergo genomic evolution. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies. Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multi-specific DARPin ® therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin ® domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape. Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin ® therapeutics, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin ® antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin ® molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin ® platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.	false
0	Impact of the B.1.1.7 variant on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing diverse epitopes on SARS–CoV–2 Spike. The interaction of the SARS–CoV–2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the ACE2 receptor on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS–CoV–2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, the N–terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike–reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS–CoV–2 infected individuals. ≈45% showed neutralizing activity of which ≈20% were NTD–specific. None of the S2–specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD–specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan–dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD–specific neutralizing antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.	false
0	Design of a candidate multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using reverse vaccinology approach. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection as a global epidemic that is spreading dramatically day to day. Currently, many efforts have been made against COVID-19 through the designing or developing of specific vaccine or drug, worldwide. In this study, we used the bioinformatics approach to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine against COVID-19 based on Spike (S) protein. Here, we employed in silico tools to identify potential T and B cell epitopes from S protein that have the ability to induce cellular and humoral immunity. Then, the peptide sequence of potential T, B cell epitopes and flagellin (as adjuvant molecule) were joined together by suitable linkers to construct of candidate multi-epitope vaccine (MEV). Subsequently, immunological and structural evaluations such as antigenicity, allergenicity, 3D modeling, molecular docking, fast flexibility simulations as well as in silico cloning were performed. Immunological and structural computational data showed that designed MEV potentially has proper capacity for inducing of cellular and humoral immune responses against COVID-19. Based on the preliminary results, in vitro and in vivo experiments are required for validation in the future.	false
0	A cautionary note on recall vaccination in ex-COVID-19 subjects. Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus require a first jab followed by recall immunization. There is no indication as to whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, and if so, if they should receive one or two vaccine doses. Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. This poses caution for ExCOVID subjects to receive a second jab both because they may have a overreaction of the inflammatory response and also in light of the current vaccine shortage.	false
0	Human Monoclonal Antibodies: On the Menu of Targeted Therapeutics Against COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, has been a tragic disaster to people all over the world. As there is no specific drug for COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies are attracting more and more attention as one of the most effective means to combat the pandemic. Here, we introduced the etiological and serological characteristics of COVID-19, discussed the current stage of development of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and summarized the antigenic epitopes in the S glycoprotein, which may deepen the understanding of the profile of immune recognition and response against SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight for the design of effective vaccines and antibody-based therapies.	false
0	Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62 354 COVID-19 cases in the USA. Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Method(s): We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69.8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. Finding(s): In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.5 vs influenza; 1.7, 1.5-1.9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1.6, 1.4-1.9 vs skin infection; 1.6, 1.3-1.9 vs cholelithiasis; 2.2, 1.9-2.6 vs urolithiasis, and 2.1, 1.9-2.5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18.1% (95% CI 17.6-18.6), including 5.8% (5.2-6.4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1.6% (95% CI 1.2-2.1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI 1.59-1.71; p<0.0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. Interpretation(s): Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

0	Working conditions and health status of 6,317 front line public health workers across five provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Public health workers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and primary health care institutes (PHIs) were among the main workers who implemented prevention, control, and containment measures. However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD(S): Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. RESULT(S): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers). The majority (71.6%) made immense efforts in both field and non-field work. Nearly 20.0% have worked all night for more than 3 days, and 45.3% had worked throughout the Chinese New Year holiday. Three risk factors and two protective factors were found to be independently associated with all three health outcomes in our final multivariate models: working all night for >3 days (multivariate odds ratio [ORm]=1.67~1.75, p<0.001), concerns about infection at work (ORm=1.46~1.89, p<0.001), perceived troubles at work (ORm=1.10~1.28, p<0.001), initiating COVID-19 prevention work after January 23 (ORm=0.78~0.82, p=0.002~0.008), and ability to persist for > 1 month at the current work intensity (ORm=0.44~0.55, p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Chinese public health workers made immense efforts and personal sacrifices to control the COVID-19 epidemic and faced the risk of mental health problems. Efforts are needed to improve the working conditions and health status of public health workers and thus maintain their morale and effectiveness during the fight against COVID-19.	false
0	Clinical management of patients with genetic obesity during COVID-19 pandemic: position paper of the ESE Growth & Genetic Obesity COVID-19 Study Group and Rare Endo-ERN main thematic group on Growth and Obesity. This article aims to provide guidance on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in patients with genetic obesity. Key principals of the management of patients with genetic obesity during COVID-19 pandemic for patients that have contracted COVID-19 are to be aware of: possible adrenal insufficiency (e.g., POMC deficiency, PWS); a more severe course in patients with concomitant immunodeficiency (e.g., LEP and LEPR deficiency), although defective leptin signalling could also be protective against the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19; disease severity being masked by insufficient awareness of symptoms in syndromic obesity patients with intellectual deficit (in particular PWS); to adjust medication dose to increased body size, preferably use dosing in m2; the high risk of malnutrition in patients with Sars-Cov2 infection, even in case of obesity. Key principals of the obesity management during the pandemic are to strive for optimal obesity management and a healthy lifestyle within the possibilities of the regulations to prevent weight (re)gain and to address anxiety within consultations, since prevalence of anxiety for COVID-19 is underestimated.	false
0	Computational analysis on Covid-19 transmission escalates into new imuuno-epidemiology considerations. <h4>Background: </h4> For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, the investigation of the heterogeneity of individual infectiousness is important due to the recorded widespread cross reactive immunity of general population that can alter transmission dynamics. We therefore aimed to understand how SARS-COV-2 transmits in the general population in relation to age. <h4>Design: </h4> Using a sample of infected population with SARS-COV-2 in close geographical proximity to the initial Severe Advanced Respiratory Syndrome-1 (SARS-1) outbreak, we explored the association between infector’s age and dispersion (or heterogeneity) of individual infectiousness (k) in order to investigate the relatedness with the age of an individual’s capability to disperse SARS-COV-2. <h4>Results: </h4> We have found a negative association between k and increase of infector’s age. Significantly this becomes more evident for the age group of 20-60 years comparing with the infectors of younger age. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Non pharmaceutical interventions can be effective to age group between 20-60 years whereas in youngsters and older patients containment of spreading must be made by other means to be effective. Immunity differences between age groups may reflect their differences in heterogeneity predicted by variance in dispersion parameter (k) .	false
0	Evaluating the effects of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) on the management of severe COVID-19 cases: A randomized controlled trial. Background: The newly discovered coronavirus has turned into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and it rages at an unprecedented rate. Considering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases. Method(s): In this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group. The intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400 mg/kg, IV, daily for three days. Both groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care. The demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors. Result(s): The mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84 +/- 3.35 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value = 0.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value = 0.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value = 0.003). There was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value < 0.001 and =0.01, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our findings did not support the use of IVIg in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Incidence of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 national quarantine in Italy. BACKGROUND: hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations represents an emergency for neurosurgery and neuro-interventional departments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown., MATERIAL AND METHOD: s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population., RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant. GCS upon admission was 3-8 in 44 % of cases in 2020 (41 patients), 39.7 % in 2019 (46 patients) and 28 % in 2018 (27 patients)., CONCLUSION: Reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 lockdown was not confirmed. Nevertheless, some patients reached the emergency rooms only several days after symptoms onset, resulting in a worse clinical condition at admission. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

0	Delayed definitive treatment of life-threatening neurosurgery patient with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the midst of pandemic: Report of two cases. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected global health system; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, both surgeon and anesthesiologist often dealt with emergency situation, optimal timing of surgery and safety protocol in hospital setting must be implemented with many facets for both patients and health-care providers., Case Description: We reported two cases. Case#1 - A 16-year-old male was referred to our hospital, due to a decreased of consciousness following a motor vehicle accident. Head CT scan revealed an epidural hemorrhage on the left temporoparietal. The patient was suspected for having COVID-19 from the reactivity of his serum against SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Procedures for the confirmation of COVID-19 and surgical preparation caused 12 h delayed from the admission. Nevertheless, the patient was deteriorated clinically before he was transported to the operating room and died after 6 cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Case#2 - A 25-year-old male was referred to RSHS, due to a decreased of consciousness, diagnosed as bilateral proximal shunt exposed with suspected COVID-19; delay occurred due to unavailability of negative pressure intensive unit for postoperative care. This caused 5760 h (4 days) delayed for bilateral shunt removal and temporary extraventricular drainage., Conclusion: Optimal timing of surgery, a good safety, and health protocol during pandemic in emergency setting are an obligation to protect health providers and patients. A decision-making plan must be organized precisely to maintain alertness, achieve the highest possible standard of care, and outcome in emergency surgical cases. Lack of monitoring must be abated to avoid fatality for patient, especially in emergency surgery setting. Copyright: © 2020 Surgical Neurology International.	false
0	Lung Ultrasound Is Often, but Not Always, Normal in Healthy Subjects: Considerations for COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: Lung ultrasound (LU) is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool in detecting lung involvement in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to ascertain the likelihood of finding LU abnormalities; mimicking lung involvement; in COVID-19 negative healthy individuals. Methods: We performed LU on 265 healthcare workers; not presenting COVID-19 major symptoms and in good health; during the course of a serological screening program for COVID-19 in our General Hospital. LU results were reported as total Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) using a 12-zone method of reporting. Results: 250/265 subjects were included in the COVID-19 negative group. LU was not completely normal (LUS not equal 0) in 65/250 COVID-19 negative subjects (26%) and in 12/15 (80%) poorly symptomatic COVID-19 positive subjects; with a multifocal pattern in 12.7% vs. 66.7% of cases respectively. Age and COVID-19 positivity were independent predictors of total LUS. A total LUS >= 2 had a sensitivity of 66.67% and a specificity of 85.60% in detecting COVID-19 positivity. Conclusions: A slightly altered LU can be quite frequent in healthy COVID-19 negative subjects. LU can have a role in confirming but not screening COVID-19 poorly symptomatic cases.	false
0	Brief Report: Virologic and Immunologic Outcomes for HIV Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: To describe the virologic and immunologic outcomes among people living with HIV (PLHIV) coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. SETTING: Wuhan, China. METHOD(S): Thirty-five coinfected patients were identified by matching the reported cases in National Notifiable Infectious Disease Report system for COVID-19 and HIV in Wuhan by time of April 19, 2020. Questionnaire-based survey and follow-up with blood sample collection were used to obtain characteristics before COVID-19 and after recovery. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, chi2, or Fisher exact test, Mcnemar test, and Wilcoxon test were conducted. RESULT(S): Twenty of the 35 coinfected patients were identified as asymptomatic/mild/moderate COVID-19 (nonsevere group) and 15 were identified as severe/critical (severe group). The severe and nonsevere group had no differences in demographics, HIV baseline status, the intervals between last tests and follow-up tests for CD4+ cell count and HIV-1 viral load (all P > 0.05). Overall, there was a significantly increased number of coinfected patients with HIV-1 viral load >=20 copies/mL after recovery (P = 0.008). The median viral load increased significantly after recovery in severe group (P = 0.034), whereas no significant change of HIV-1 viral load was observed in the nonsevere group. Limited change of CD4+ cell count was found (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 may put PLHIV at greater risk for HIV-1 viral rebound especially for severe/critical COVID-19, whereas it had limited impacts on CD4+ cell count. Whether continuous antiretroviral therapy against HIV infection would have significant impacts on CD4+ cell count among PLHIV coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 needs further research.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	A rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: The North Central London Critical Care Transfer Hub. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented demand for critical care beds across the world(1). North Central London (NCL) Sustainable Training Partnership (STP) critical care capacity expanded by over 100%(2), presenting extreme pressures on staff and consumables, with significant logistical challenges. Objective(s): The NCL transfer team was established on 3rd April 2020, with the primary aim to manage the safe movement of critically unwell patients to decompress overwhelmed critical care units and optimise patient care. The secondary aim was to alleviate the workload of stretched referring units by organising the logistics of transfer, relaying clinical patient information and mobilising a dedicated transfer team to retrieve the patient, whilst protecting the resources at the referring site. (Diag. 1). Method(s): A central point of contact was established to streamline referrals with real-time updates of bed capacity across the sector. Three dedicated consultant-led teams were created and responsible for the movement of patients both in and out of the sector. The Hub provided operational support to the transfer teams and sector hospitals. Ambulances provided by London Ambulance Service (LAS) were matched with teams at their base hospitals (Diagram 1). The Hub created a central gateway through which activity and outcomes could be recorded for quality improvement. A COVID-19 transfer app was designed in partnership with InforceHub (data analytics company), ensuring NHS data security governance. Result(s): A total of 81 transfers were performed during April 2020, with a peak of 7 transfers per day. No critical incidences were reported. 60 patients were transferred in sector, follow up showed a 48% 30-day mortality, with men aged between 60-69 most affected, comparable to ICNARC data (3). 68% represented BAME groups, with a proportional mortality of 48%, comparable to Caucasian group at 50% in this data set. The most prevalent complications within 30 days of admission were: PE/DVT (40%), renal failure requiring haemofiltration (36%), and ongoing ventilatory failure requiring proning, (42%). This is a small data set with inherent limiting factors. Conclusion(s): NHS England (NHSE) project that the demand for critical care across London will continue to increase with plans to double the critical care capacity (2). Critical transfers for specialist care and bed capacity will continue to require a co-ordinated response for the benefit of patients and workforce. The NCL transfer hub provided a valuable service during this novel pandemic. An NHSE advisory group is producing a National business case for a new Pan-London Critical Transfer Service. As board advisors, our collective experiences and expertise will help to shape a broader and cohesive vision for critical care transfers in London.	false
0	Sex disparities and neutralizing antibody durability to SARS-CoV-2 infection in convalescent individuals. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now caused over 2 million deaths worldwide and continues to expand. Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2. Using convalescent sera collected from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out to six months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response and male sex. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities. <h4>Significance</h4> In this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort, higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex compared to female sex. We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Unicorn Poo and Blessed Waters: COVID-19 Quackery and FDA Warning Letters. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global setting of clinical crisis and human anxiety. Without available safe and effective vaccines and cures, an unscrupulous marketplace has emerged selling COVID-19 quackery (fraudulent misrepresentation of preventions and treatments). Method(s): US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning Letters issued from March 2020 to July 2020 were analyzed for themes pertaining to unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded COVID-19 products. Result(s): During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. Conclusion(s): A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery. FDA Warning Letters are a component of meaningful corrective action; however, greater effort in spreading awareness of such misrepresented, unapproved, and adulterated products is needed to deter purchases of such products.Copyright © 2020, The Drug Information Association, Inc.	false
0	Impact of covid-19 pandemic and national lockdown on mental health among general urban indian population: An online based cross-sectional survey. Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the urban Indian population during the period of national lockdown imposed by the government of India to combat the COVID-19 pandemic Method: Total 278 participants were participated in an online, cross-sectional survey. Anxiety and depression was assessed. Gender, age, occupation and average time spent on gathering information on COVID-19 was assessed. Result(s): less than 30 years of age and students showed higher prevalence of depression. Participants spending more than three hours on COVID-19 information showed that 18.2%, 42.4% and 37.9% were mildly, moderately and severely affected by anxiety symptoms, respectively and 19.7%, 47% and 24.2% were mildly, moderately and severely affected with depression. Further, more than three hours of time spent on COVID-19 showed strong association with mild, moderate and severe anxiety (p<0.001) as well as mild, moderate and severe depression (p<=0.01). Conclusion(s): Participants, less than 30 years of age and students were found more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms. Participants who have been spending more than three hours on COVID-19 information were strongly affected with mild, moderate and severe anxiety as well as depression.Copyright © 2021, World Informations Syndicate.

0	Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in children: accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate. The tests currently used for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 include specimens taken from the upper and lower respiratory tract. Although recommendations from the World Health Organization prioritise the usage of a nasopharyngeal swab (NS), nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) are thought to be superior in identifying SARS-CoV-2 in children. To our knowledge, however, no paediatric study has been published on the subject. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of NS referred to NPA for SARS-CoV-2 in children. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the NS referred to the NPA of the whole sample and considered both age and collection period as covariates in different analyses. We collected 300 paired samples. The NS had a specificity of 97.7% and a sensitivity of 58.1%. We found similar results for the group of subjects >= 6 years old, while for subjects < 6 years old, the sensitivity was 66.7% and the specificity 97.8%. Considering period as a covariate, the sensitivity and specificity for patients hospitalised in March (31 patients, 52 records) were 70.0% and 97.6%, while for patients involved in the follow-up (16 patients, 57 records), they were 57.2% and 89.7%. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to the NPA, whereas its specificity is high. Our results suggest that in children under 6 years of age, NSs should be preferred whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of the NS rises when performed before the NPA.	false
0	Otorhinolaryngological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019: A prospective review of 600 patients. Objectives. To evaluate otorhinolaryngological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and the time required for their resolution. Methods. A prospective analysis was conducted of coronavirus disease 2019 patients presenting from 1 April 2020 to 30 July 2020. The otorhinolaryngological manifestations were evaluated based on patient history. The time required for symptom resolution was evaluated separately for intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit patients. Results. A total of 600 patients were included in the study; 13.3 per cent required the intensive care unit and 2.2 per cent expired. The otorhinolaryngological manifestations were: Sore throat (88 per cent), fever (78.8 per cent), anosmia or hyposmia (63.6 per cent), ageusia or hypogeusia (63.5 per cent), rhinorrhoea (51.3 per cent), nasal obstruction (33.5 per cent), sneezing (30.3 per cent), and breathing difficulty (18.6 per cent). The time requiredfor symptom resolution was longest for breathing difficulty (23.6 days for intensive care unit and 8.2 days for non-intensive care unit patients). Conclusion. Otorhinolaryngological symptoms are one of the main presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The increased prevalence of medical co-morbidities in patients requiring intensive care unit and in deceased patients is also highlighted.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

0	A review of COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 with focus on proof of efficacy. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is rapidly becoming an established consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 patients though there is a need to critically review this area for proof of efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are considered to play main role in viral clearance. CP infusion may also help in the modulation of immune response by its immunomodulatory effect. The FDA allows for administration of CP to COVID-19 patients. The present published literature in COVID-19 is limited to case series and randomised controlled trial where plasma therapy was used in moderate, severe and critically ill patients. Though multiple uncertainties exist regarding to its efficacy, appropriate donor selection and NAb titres, the efficacy data of CP use inCOVID-19 is limited having shown hope with early and severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Cardiac manifestation of corona virus disease 2019: a preliminary report. BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multi-systemic illness that can present with cardiac complications. This report describes the preliminary findings of cardiac manifestations seen in patients managed in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria., METHODS: Ten patients, part of an ongoing study of patients admitted in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria, with COVID-19 diagnosed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology were retrospectively studied for cardiac manifestations., RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 52.5 +/- 18.79 years (with a minimum of 17 years and maximum of 79 years). Six patients were female and four were male. Hypertension was seen in 70%, diabetes in 50% and obesity in 60% of patients. All had elevated inflammatory markers. Only four patients had bilateral pneumonia. The rest had only cardiac manifestations. Six patients presented with de novo heart failure and one had decompensated heart failure. A set of three patients had individually fulminant myocarditis, probable pulmonary embolism and stress cardiomyopathy, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that co-morbidities are common in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac complications. The array of cardiac complications is large, with the commonest being heart failure.	false
0	Sociodemographic risk factors for COVID-19 infection among Massachusetts healthcare workers: a retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To better understand COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers (HCW), we investigated occupational and non-occupational risk factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 incidence among a Massachusetts HCW cohort., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The retrospective cohort study included adult HCWs in a single healthcare system from March 9 to June 3, 2020., METHODS: Participants' SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results and demographics were de-identified and extracted from an established occupational health, COVID-19 database at the healthcare system. HCWs from each particular job grouping had been categorized into frontline/non-frontline workers. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and odds ratio were used to compare subgroups after excluding HCWs involved in early infection clusters before universal masking. A sensitivity analysis was performed comparing jobs with the greatest potential occupational risks with others., RESULTS: 152 out of 5177 (2.94%) HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19. Affected HCWs resided in areas with higher community attack rates (median: 1755.2 vs. 1412.4 cases per 100,000, P<0.001)(multivariate-adjusted IRR: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.03-3.44 comparing 5th to 1st quintile of community rates). After multivariate adjustment, African Americans and Hispanics had higher incidence than non-Hispanic white HCWs (IRR: 2.78, 95%CI: 1.78-4.33; and IRR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.42-4.07, respectively). After adjusting for race and residential rates, frontline HCWs had a higher IRR (1.73, 95%CI: 1.16-2.54) compared to non-frontline HCWs overall, but not within specific job categories, nor when comparing the highest risk jobs to others., CONCLUSIONS: After universal masking was instituted, the strongest risk factors associated with HCWs' COVID-19 infection were residential community infection rate and race.	false
0	Global Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection Requiring Admission to the ICU: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented burden on the delivery of intensive care services worldwide. Research Question: What is the global point estimate of deaths and risk factors for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched up to August 1, 2020. Pooled prevalence of participant characteristics, clinical features, and outcome data was calculated with the use of random effects models. Subgroup analyses were based on geographic distribution, study type, quality assessment, sample size, end date, and patient disposition. Studies that reported in-hospital mortality rate of adult patients (age >18 years) with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to an ICU met study eligibility criteria. Critical evaluation was performed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies. Result(s): Forty-five studies with 16,561 patients from 17 countries across four continents were included. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs had a mean age of 62.6 years (95% CI, 60.4-64.7). Common comorbidities included hypertension (49.5%; 95% CI, 44.9-54.0) and diabetes mellitus (26.6%; 95% CI, 22.7-30.8). More than three-quarters of cases experienced the development of ARDS (76.1%; 95% CI, 65.7-85.2). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1-75.7) of case, vasopressor support in 65.9% (95% CI, 52.4-78.4) of cases, renal replacement therapy in 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-22.2) of cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 6.4% (95% CI, 4.1-9.1) of cases. The duration of ICU and hospital admission was 10.8 days (95% CI, 9.3-18.4) and 19.1 days (95% CI, 16.3-21.9), respectively, with in-hospital mortality rate of 28.1% (95% CI, 23.4-33.0; I2 = 96%). No significant subgroup effect was observed. Interpretation(s): Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to the ICU require substantial organ support and prolonged ICU and hospital level care. The pooled estimate of global death from severe COVID-19 is <1 in 3.Copyright © 2020 American College of Chest Physicians	false
0	Effective epidemic model for COVID-19 using accumulated deaths. The severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 has been in the center of the ongoing global health crisis in 2020. The high prevalence of mild cases facilitates sub-notification outside hospital environments and the number of those who are or have been infected remains largely unknown, leading to poor estimates of the crude mortality rate of the disease. Here we use a simple model to describe the number of accumulated deaths caused by COVID-19. The close connection between the proposed model and an approximate solution of the SIR model provides estimates of epidemiological parameters. We find values for the crude mortality between 10- 4 and 10- 3 which are lower than estimates numbers obtained from laboratory-confirmed patients. We also calculate quantities of practical interest such as the basic reproduction number and subsequent increment after relaxation of lockdown and other control measures.

0	A Risk Model of Admitting Patients With Silent SARS-CoV-2 Infection to Surgery and Development of Severe Postoperative Outcomes and Death: Projections Over 24 Months for 5 Geographical Regions. OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery with subsequent risk of severe pulmonary complications and mortality. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on nonsymptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death. METHOD(S): We developed 2 sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (eg, United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population. RESULT(S): Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92,000 (UI 68,000-124,000) pulmonary complications and almost 30,000 deaths (UI 22,000-40.000), respectively; for Europe, some 131,000 patients (UI 97,000-178,000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47,000 deaths (UI 34,000-63,000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18,700 (UI 13,700-25,300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6400 (UI 4600-8600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259,000 (UI 191,000-351,000) pulmonary complications and 89,000 deaths (UI 65,000-120,000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 1.2 million pulmonary complications and 350,000 deaths. CONCLUSION(S): The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge. Background: The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood., Methods: Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 age, sex, body mass index comorbidity-matched controls were enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments., Findings: At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced breathlessness and 55% reported fatigue. On MRI, abnormalities were seen in lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%). Patients exhibited changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domains. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance were significantly reduced. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise intolerance correlated with serum markers of inflammation and acute illness severity. Patients had a higher burden of self-reported symptoms of depression and experienced significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls (p<0.0001 to 0.044)., Interpretation: A significant proportion of patients discharged from hospital reported symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, depression and had limited exercise capacity. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common in patients and linked to inflammation and severity of acute illness., Funding: NIHR Oxford and Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centres, British Heart Foundation Centre for Research Excellence, UKRI, Wellcome Trust, British Heart Foundation.

0	Updated SARS-CoV-2 Single Nucleotide Variants and Mortality Association. Since its outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 has caused 100,5844,555 cases and 2,167,313 deaths as of Jan 27, 2021. Comparing our previous study of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before June 2020, we found out that the SNV clustering had changed considerably since June 2020. Apart from that the group SNVs represented by two non-synonymous mutations A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L) became dominant and carried by over 95% genomes, a few emerging groups of SNVs were recognized with sharply increased monthly occurrence ratios up to 70% in November 2020. Further investigation revealed that several SNVs were strongly associated with the mortality, but they presented distinct distribution in specific countries, e.g., Brazil, USA, Saudi Arabia, India, and Italy. SNVs including G25088T, T25A, G29861T and G29864A were adopted in a regularized logistic regression model to predict the mortality status in Brazil with the AUC of 0.84. Protein structure analysis showed that the emerging subgroups of non-synonymous SNVs and those mortality-related ones in Brazil were located on protein surface area. The clashes in protein structure introduced by these mutations might in turn affect virus pathogenesis through conformation changes, leading to the difference in transmission and virulence. Particularly, we found that SNVs tended to occur in intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of Spike (S) and ORF1ab, suggesting a critical role of SNVs in protein IDRs to determine protein folding and immune evasion.	false
0	Are telephone consultations here to stay in rheumatology?. Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face rheumatology follow-up appointments were mostly replaced with telephone or virtual consultations in order to protect vulnerable patients. We aimed to investigate the perspectives of rheumatology patients on the use of telephone consultations compared with the traditional face-to-face consultation., Methods: We carried out a retrospective survey of all rheumatology follow-up patients at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust who had received a telephone consultation from a rheumatology consultant during a 4-week period via an online survey tool., Results: Surveys were distributed to 1213 patients, of whom 336 (27.7%) responded, and 306 (91.1%) patients completed all components of the survey. Overall, an equal number of patients would prefer telephone clinics or face-to-face consultations for their next routine appointment. When divided by age group, the majority who preferred the telephone clinics were <50 years old [chi2 (d.f. = 3) = 10.075, P = 0.018]. Prevalence of a smartphone was higher among younger patients (<50 years old: 46 of 47, 97.9%) than among older patients (>=50 years old: 209 of 259, 80.7%) [chi2 (d.f. = 3) = 20.919, P < 0.001]. More patients reported that they would prefer a telephone call for urgent advice (168, 54.9%)., Conclusion: Most patients interviewed were happy with their routine face-to-face appointment being switched to a telephone consultation. Of those interviewed, patients >50 years old were less likely than their younger counterparts to want telephone consultations in place of face-to-face appointments. Most patients in our study would prefer a telephone consultation for urgent advice. We must ensure that older patients and those in vulnerable groups who value in-person contact are not excluded. Telephone clinics in some form are here to stay in rheumatology for the foreseeable future. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Forecasting hospital demand in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 pandemic and estimates of lockdown-induced 2nd waves. We present a forecasting model aim to predict hospital occupancy in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our SEIRD type model features asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with detailed hospital dynamics. We model explicitly branching probabilities and non-exponential residence times in each latent and infected compartments. Using both hospital admittance confirmed cases and deaths, we infer the contact rate and the initial conditions of the dynamical system, considering breakpoints to model lockdown interventions and the increase in effective population size due to lockdown relaxation. The latter features let us model lockdown-induced 2nd waves. Our Bayesian approach allows us to produce timely probabilistic forecasts of hospital demand. We have applied the model to analyze more than 70 metropolitan areas and 32 states in Mexico.	false
0	A systematic review on the recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 virus: frequency, risk factors, and possible explanations. BACKGROUND: Since late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 which leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused thousands of deaths. There are some pieces of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genome could be re-detectable in recovered patients., METHODS: We performed a systematic review in the PubMed/Medline database to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 recurrence. The last update was for 20 November 2020. Among the 1178 initially found articles, 66 met the inclusion criteria and were considered., FINDINGS: In total, 1128 patients with at least one-time recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Recurrence rate has been reported between 2.3% and 21.4% in cohort studies, within a mean of 20 (ranged 1-98) days after discharge; younger patients are being affected more. Following the second course of disease, the disease severity decreased or remained unchanged in 97.3% while it increased in 2.6%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were positive in 11-95% and 58.8-100%, respectively. Based on the literature, three possibilities include reactivation of previous disease, reinfection with the same virus, and false negative, which have been discussed in details., CONCLUSION: There is a relatively notable risk of disease recurrence in previously recovered patients, even those who are immunised against the virus. More studies are required to clarify the underlying cause of this phenomenon.	false
0	"Surgical activation protocol COVID-19 (SAP COVID). Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak have major implications in conventional surgical practice. As the number of patients with this diagnosis is rising, the infection risk for the surgical staff will be higher.

0	Acute kidney injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients: Incidence and outcome. Introduction: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) emerged in Whuan, China and had rapidly spreading worldwide, to become the most global health issue nowadays. Kidneys are one of the extra pulmonary organs frequently affected by this infection. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized risk factor which increased the mortality rate in critically ill patients with sepsis. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and risk factors of AKI in COVID-19 critically ill patients as well as to establish clinical and prognosis profile. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the charts of consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between Mars 11 and Mai 15, 2020 in Valenciennes regional hospital. The study collected clinical features at admission, severity of illness, ICU course, the occurrence and management of AKI. The diagnosis of AKI was based on kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with AKI, and to determine the risk of mortality secondary to AKI Results: A total of 77 confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU during the study period. Among them 37(48.05%) presented an acute renal failure. Their main characteristics were: mean age, 64.67+/-11.02; male, 29(78.4%); mean BMI, 31.97+/-6.7 kg/m2; mean Charlson index, 3.03+/-1.99; 4 (10.8%) patients with medical history of chronic kidney disease; mean SAPSII score, 39.78+/- 11.28; mean SOFA score, 5.56+/- 2.93; invasive mechanical ventilation, 32(86.5%); vasopressors, 33(89.2%); hydrocortisone, 14(37.8%). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 24(64.9%) patients and the most used modality was an intermittent hemodialysis in 10 patients (41.7%). Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis was used in 3(12.5%) patients and 9(37.5%) patients had received both modalities of hemodialysis. Mortality rate was 21(56.8%) and the mean length of ICU stay was 19.46+/-17.72 days. For ICU survivors, only 4 patients had their ad integrum renal function restored and no patient need dialysis after hospital discharge. Univariate then multivariate regression analysis identified the AKI as an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients (OR, 17.74; 95%CI[4.22-74.52], p 0.000), and yielded the following variables as independently associated to AKI: age> 65 years (OR, 3.77; 95% CI[1.19-11.91], p 0.024), septic shock (OR, 5.54; 95% CI[1.49-20.5], p 0.01) and the use of muscles blocker agents (OR, 4.26; 95% CI[1.34- 13.5], p 0.014). Conclusion(s): The present study among COVID-19 critically ill patients identified acute kidney injury as independent factor associated with mortality and showed that the incidence of acute renal failure, increasing in patients aged more than 65 years, presented septic shock and had received muscle blocker agents during their ICU stay.	false

In December 2019, a rare case of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. This was later analyzed and known to have similar characteristics as viral pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus. Later, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease as COVID19. The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) ought to taint both the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. This COVID-19 is spreading quickly with an immense rise in cases around the world. This infection's mechanism stays obscure, and the medications explicit for the infection were not grown at this point. Infection is highly contagious. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is one of seven kinds of crown infection, including the one which causes severe maladies like Middle East respiratory disorder (MERS) and abrupt, intense respiratory syndrome(SARS). Since its revelation, the infection has spread and has caused anxiety and fear among people. Recent vaccines are tracked, and clinical trials can bring an immediate protocol on a medication approach. By including different therapeutic approaches, it is easier to combat the disease quickly. With very low mortality and high transmission rate, new approaches to vaccines and nanomedicines bring down the spread. Controlled patient care is also crucial. On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease as 'global pandemic'. COVID-19, therefore, poses a significant threat to global public health. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic methods. The review also focuses on repurposed drugs, traced vaccines, and a quick view of prophylactic nanomedicines as an alternative for COVID 19. For this review, the complete database has been collected from various search engines such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier, etc., from the year 2001-2020 using the following keywords.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Acute immune signatures and their legacies in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infected cancer patients. Given the immune system's importance for cancer surveillance and treatment, we have investigated how it may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection of cancer patients. Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19+ non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care. Following SARS-Cov-2 infection, Sultan et al. showed that the majority of solid cancer patients cleared virus, recovered from COVID-19, and re-established their prior immunological status. In contrast, hematological cancer patients demonstrated delayed or negligible seroconversion, prolonged shedding, and sustained immune dysregulation highlighting the need for careful oversight of these patients.Copyright © 2021	false
0	Assessing the role of quarantine and isolation as control strategies for COVID-19 outbreak: A case study. Life style of people almost in every country has been changed with arrival of corona virus. Under the drastic influence of the virus, mathematicians, statisticians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, environmentalists, health providers, and government officials started searching for strategies including mathematical modeling, lock-down, face masks, isolation, quarantine, and social distancing. With quarantine and isolation being the most effective tools, we have formulated a new nonlinear deterministic model based upon ordinary differential equations containing six compartments (susceptible S ( t ) , exposed E ( t ) , quarantined Q ( t ) , infected I ( t ) , isolated J ( t ) and recovered R ( t ) ). The model is found to have positively invariant region whereas equilibrium points of the model are investigated for their local stability with respect to the basic reproductive number R0 . The computed value of R0 = 1.31 proves endemic level of the epidemic. Using nonlinear least-squares method and real prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan, best parameters are obtained and their sensitivity is analyzed. Various simulations are presented to appreciate quarantined and isolated strategies if applied sensibly. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize current knowledge of the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)., RECENT FINDINGS: Several observational studies, including case series, patient surveys, and patient registries, have examined the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Due to methodologic limitations (focus on sicker patients, exclusion of asymptomatic or mild cases, limited or inaccurate viral testing), it is difficult to determine the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in SLE patients. Corticosteroids might be associated with increased hospitalizations from COVID-19 in individuals with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Some immune suppressive treatments do not appear to significantly increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 or poor subsequent outcomes; however, data on the safety of specific drugs remain scarce. Studies in non-autoimmune cohorts have shown more severe COVID-19 in ethnic and racial minorities, populations also more heavily impacted by SLE. Such results have been attributed to highly prevalent socioeconomic disparities and comorbidities. The complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immunologic milieu may have particular implications for patients with SLE that remain to be explored. Concerns have been raised of COVID-19 heightening the risk of thromboembolic events in the presence of an SLE-induced procoagulant state. Limitations in epidemiologic data available to date do not allow for assessing the risk and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Other than corticosteroids, prior use of some immune suppressive medications does not appear to increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 however, more comprehensive studies are needed.	false
0	Vitamin D supplementation to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths-accumulating evidence from epidemiological and intervention studies calls for immediate action. The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to human health, health care systems, public life, and economy around the globe. The repertoire of effective therapies for severe courses of the disease has remained limited. A large proportion of the world population suffers from vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, with prevalence being particularly high among the COVID-19 high-risk populations. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.Copyright © 2021 by the author.

0	Cardiac Biomarker Abnormalities Are Closely Related to Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is erupting and spreading globally. Cardiovascular complications secondary to the infection have caught notice. This study aims to delineate the relationship of cardiac biomarkers and outcomes in severe cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One hundred forty-eight critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. From these patients, the demographic data, symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Four patients in the non-survivor group were selected, and their cardiac biomarkers were collected and analyzed. Among the 148 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular complications was 19 (12.8%). Five of them were survivors (5.2%), and 14 of them were non-survivors (26.9%). Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors had higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB, myoglobin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P < 0.05). The occurrence of cardiovascular events began at 11-15 days after the onset of the disease and reached a peak at 14-20 days. COVID-19 not only is a respiratory disease but also causes damage to the cardiovascular system. Cardiac biomarkers have the potential for early warning and prognostic evaluation in patients with COVID-19. It is recommended that cardiac biomarker monitoring in patients with COVID-19 should be initiated at least from the 11th day of the disease course.	false
0	Pandemic-Specific Factors Related to Generalized Anxiety Disorder during the Initial COVID-19 Protocols in the United States. Little is known about the psychological stress and secondary impacts emerging among the general U.S. population as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose for the current study is to assess the prevalence rates of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and to establish psychosocial correlates, pandemic-themed concerns, and other comorbidities for those with GAD at the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This online study included 2,101 U.S. adults between April 14-22, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home protocols and assessed GAD, psychosocial factors, and pandemic-related factors including concerns, changes in health behaviors, and adherence to protocols. The results demonstrated a high prevalence rate (17.9%) for GAD during the initial COVID-19 outbreak compared with the prior 1.8% 12-month estimate before the pandemic. Individuals with GAD reported significantly higher levels of stress, loneliness, fatigue, and empathic concern, along with reductions in levels of quality of life. Likewise, those with GAD reported significantly higher pandemic-related concerns, poorer changes in general health behaviors, and less confidence in the government's response to the pandemic. For clinical purposes, these findings provide insight into the various types of pandemic-themed worries that individuals meeting clinical criteria for GAD will have the most difficulties controlling.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence, Prehospital Evaluation, and Presentation of Ischemic Stroke at a Nonurban Comprehensive Stroke Center. Introduction: Many reports have described a decrease in the numbers of patients seeking medical attention for typical emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. These reports primarily relate to urban areas with widespread community transmission. The impact of COVID-19 on nonurban areas with minimal community transmission is less well understood., Methods: Using a prospectively maintained prehospital quality improvement database, we reviewed our hospital EMS transports with a diagnosis of stroke from January to April 2019 (baseline) and January to April 2020 (pandemic). We compared the volume of patients, transport/presentation times, severity of presenting symptoms, and final diagnosis., Results: In January, February, March, and April 2019, 10, 11, 17, and 19 patients, respectively, were transported in comparison to 19, 14, 10, and 8 during the same months in 2020. From January through April 2019, there was a 53% increase in transports, compared to a 42% decrease during the same months in 2020, constituting significantly different trend-line slopes (3.30; 95% CI 0.48-6.12 versus -3.70; 95% CI -5.76--1.64, p = 0.001). Patient demographics, comorbidities, and symptom severity were mostly similar over the two time periods, and the number of patients with a final diagnosis of stroke was also similar. However, the median interval from EMS dispatch to ED arrival for patients with a final diagnosis of stroke was significantly longer in January to April 2020 (50 +/- 11.7 min) compared to the same time period in 2019 (42 +/- 8.2 min, p = 0.01). Discussion/Conclusion. Our data indicate a decrease in patient transport volumes and longer intervals to EMS activation for suspected stroke care. These results suggest that even in a nonurban location without widespread community transmission, patients may be delaying or avoiding care for severe illnesses such as stroke. Clinicians and public health officials should not ignore the potential impact of pandemic-like illnesses even in areas of relatively low disease prevalence.

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 73 million COVID-19 cases and ~1.6 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 severity has revealed a male sex bias which increases with age. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this disparity will not only be beneficial to host-specific treatment but will give insight into the pathogenesis of the virus in general. Here we investigated the male sex and age bias as well as the corresponding immunological regulation contributing to COVID-19 using ferrets as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We investigated infected adult male, aged male, and adult female ferrets with SARS-CoV-2 at 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; intranasally. Ferrets were monitored for clinical signs post-inoculation and in-life samples and end-point tissues were collected. The samples were analyzed for viral dynamics by qRT-PCR and live viral load by TCID 50 assays. Respiratory tissue was investigated for tissue destruction and viral antigen presence by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing of isolated RNA from the upper and lower respiratory tract was performed using the NovaSeq 6000 50 base-pair, paired-end run for a minimum of 30 million reads per sample. Sequence analysis was used to determine differential gene expression. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Clinically, all groups of ferrets developed mild disease although all males had consistent temperature decreases while females developed a fever. Viral load analysis revealed that aged male ferrets shed virus from their nares for longer and had higher viral loads in the upper respiratory tract associated with increased pathology. Host response analysis indicated that female ferrets had significant increases in antiviral and interferon response genes as soon as day 2 post-infection characterized by the upregulation of OASL, MX1, and ISG15 as well as others, whereas upregulation of antiviral genes was delayed until day 7 in aged males. In the later time points, males had significant increases in genes associated with neurological signalling and sensory detection (taste and smell) such as RTP1, CHGA, and CHGA1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Older male ferrets had increased viral shedding and burden compared to females which may have been due to the dysregulation of the male antiviral responses. Increases in olfactory-associated genes during the infection time course may suggest mechanisms regulating anosmia, which has been associated with COVID-19. These results provide insight into COVID-19 epidemiological findings and suggest that the male sex bias in hospitalizations has a biological component and is not solely due to cultural and behavioural factors. Considering the threat of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in hosts that have prolonged viral replication and shedding, understanding why older males have increased viral durability is of public health importance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), NIH/NIAID, Genome Atlantic, and Canadian Foundation for Innovation through the Major Science Initiates Fund and by Innovation Saskatchewan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: Authors declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: All work was conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines, AUP number 20200016 by the University Animal Care Committee (UACC) Animal Research Ethics Board (AREB) from the University of Saskatchewan.	false
0	Asymptomatic hypoxia in COVID-19 is associated with poor outcome. Objectives: Describe and evaluate the outcome of a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patient without shortness of breath. Design and methods: We retrospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed and cared for in Marseille, France. We selected data from patients who at admission, had a low dose CT scanner, dyspnea status, and oxygen saturation available. Blood gas was analyzed in a sample subset of patients. Results: Among 1712 patients with COVID-19, we report that 1107 (64.7%) do not complain of shortness of breath at admission. The low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan showed signs compatible with pneumonia in 757/1,107 (68.4%) of patients without dyspnea. In a subset of patients who had underwent at least one blood gas analysis (n = 161) and presented without dyspnea at admission, 28.1% (27/96) presented with a hypoxemia/hypocapnia syndrome. Asymptomatic hypoxia was associated with a very poor outcome (33.3% were transferred to the ICU and 25.9% died). Conclusion: The absence of shortness of breath in an old patient with comorbidity merit medical attention and should not be considered as a good sign of well-being. The poor prognosis of asymptomatic hypoxia, highlight the severity of this mild clinical presentation. In these patients, pulse oximetry is an important mean to predict the outcome along with news score and LDCT scanner. (C) 2020 The Authors.

0	Understanding the genetic determinant of severity in viral diseases: a case of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Background: Numerous research studies have identified specific human gene variants that affect enhanced susceptibility to viral infections. More recently is the current pandemic where the SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown a high degree of person-to-person clinical variability. A wide range of disease severity occurs in the patients' experiences, from asymptomatic cases, mild infections to serious life threatening conditions requiring admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). Main body of the abstract: Although, it is generally reported that age and co-morbidities contribute significantly to the variations in the clinical outcome of the scourge of COVID-19, a hypothetical question of the possibility of genetic involvement in the susceptibility and severity of the disease arose when some unique severe outcomes were seen among young patients with no co-morbidity. The role human genetics play in clinical response to the viral infections is scarcely understood; however, several ongoing researches all around the world are currently focusing on possible genetic factors. This review reports the possible genetic factors that have been widely studied in defining the severity of viral infections using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. These involve the possible involvements of ACE2, HLA, and TLR genes such as TLR7 and TLR3 in the presentation of a more severe condition. Short conclusion: Understanding these variations could help to inform efforts to identify people at increased risk of infection outbreaks through genetic diagnosis of infections by locating disease genes or mutations that predispose patients to severe infection. This will also suggest specific targets for therapy and prophylaxis.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Identifying prognostic risk factors for poor outcome following COVID-19 disease among in-centre haemodialysis patients: role of inflammation and frailty. INTRODUCTION: The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has highly affected patients with comorbidities and frailty who cannot self-isolate, such as individuals undergoing haemodialysis. The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for mortality and hospitalisation, which may be useful in future disease spikes., METHODS: We collected data retrospectively from the electronic medical records of all patients receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 11th March and 10th May 2020 undergoing maintenance haemodialysis at four satellite dialysis units from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Mortality was the primary outcome, and the need for hospitalization was the secondary one., RESULTS: Out of 746 patients undergoing regular haemodialysis, 148 symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were included in the analysis. The overall mortality rate was 24.3%. By univariate analysis, older age, ischaemic heart disease, lower systolic blood pressure, lower body mass index (BMI) and higher frailty scores were associated with higher rates of mortality (all p value < 0.05). The laboratory factors associated with mortality were higher values of WBC, neutrophil counts, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin, ferritin, troponin, and lower serum albumin level (all p value < 0.05). In the logistic regression, mortality was associated with older age and higher CRP, while high levels of NLR and CRP were associated with the need for hospitalization., DISCUSSION: Haemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high mortality rate. Our study identifies prognostic risk factors associated with poor outcome including age, frailty and markers of inflammation, which may support more informed clinical decision-making.	false
0	Disruption of CCR5 signaling to treat COVID-19-associated cytokine storm: Case series of four critically ill patients treated with leronlimab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The number of confirmed cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 continues to escalate with over 70 million confirmed cases and over 1.6 million confirmed deaths. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulated host immune response to the virus, which is thought to lead to pathogenic immune dysregulation and end-organ damage. Presently few effective treatment options are available to treat COVID-19. Leronlimab is a humanized IgG4, kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). It has been shown that in patients with severe COVID-19 treatment with leronlimab reduces elevated plasma IL-6 and chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and normalized CD4/CD8 ratios. We administered leronlimab to 4 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care. All 4 of these patients improved clinically as measured by vasopressor support, and discontinuation of hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation. Following administration of leronlimab there was a statistically significant decrease in IL-6 observed in patient A (p=0.034) from day 0-7 and patient D (p=0.027) from day 0-14. This corresponds to restoration of the immune function as measured by CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. Although two of the patients went on to survive the other two subsequently died of surgical complications after an initial recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).	false
0	COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations: does HHV-6 play an etiological role?. Recently, during the development of COVID-19 pandemic, several publications have warned of possible cutaneous manifestations in association with this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In our hospital we have created a multidisciplinary unit with a specific protocol to attend patients with these manifestations. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who, during the development of the pandemic, were clinically suspected and/or microbiologically confirmed of COVID-19 and had a recent-onset skin rash (within the last 4 weeks). All patients underwent biochemistry, hematimetry and serology for parvovirus B19 and for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), as well as other serologies and a coagulation study according to clinical manifestations. Based on the findings, we also randomly selected 12 hospitalized patients, with similar median age, with COVID-19 but without cutaneous manifestations, and we requested HHV-6 serology. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay was Roche's Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the HHV-6 antibody assay was ELISA-VIDITEST anti-HHV-6 IgM (Vidia). The protocol was approved by the Aragon Ethical Committee for Clinical Research.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 individuals. Characterization of the T cell response in individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand its contribution to protective immunity. A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. There were 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses detected across six different HLAs, corresponding to 52 unique epitope reactivities. CD8+ T cell responses were detected in almost all convalescent individuals and were directed against several structural and non-structural target epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample and characterized by early differentiation kinetics. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.	false
0	Monitoring for outbreak-associated excess mortality in an African city: Detection limits in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Objectives: Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. Design(s): Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be for being detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. Result(s): The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detect anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo. Conclusion(s): Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline. Data from 2020 will undergo necessary processing and quality control in the coming months. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting this information.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

Introduction: Lockdown and isolation measures have been necessary to contain spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In Italy, the most stringent lockdown measures were kept from March 9 to May 18, 2020. In the meantime, an increase in global traffic on several pornography websites was reported. We aimed to investigate whether this trend (search query: ""Pornhub"") was also associated with a decline in Google queries for sex work (search query: ""Escort"") and dating apps (search query: ""Tinder""), and whether reversal of such trends occurred at the end of lockdown. Material(s) and Method(s): Analysis was conducted on data from Google Trends, a tool to explore the relative popularity of selected search queries in selected regions over a specific duration. Non-parametric regression via Mann-Kendall trend test and pairwise comparisons via Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hoch correction were used to measure differences in trends before, during and after lockdown. Result(s): Data between January 1 and September 4, 2020 were retrieved. All search items showed significant trends (Pornhub: P < 0.0001; Escort: P < 0.0001; Tinder: P = 0.0187). Queries for Pornhub were more prevalent during lockdown than either before or after (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0003, respectively), and more prevalent after than before lockdown (P < 0.0001). Queries for Escort significantly declined during lockdown (P < 0.0001) and steadily increased after measures were withdrawn (P < 0.0001), despite being still lower than before (P < 0.012). Queries for Tinder decreased during lockdown (P < 0.0001) and increased soon after (P < 0.0001), with no significant change between before and after lockdown (P = 0.15). Conclusion(s): Interest in regards to pornography increased in Italy during lockdown, and, while declining, remained high once lockdown measures were withdrawn. Interest concerning dating apps and sex work declined abruptly during lockdown, and increased once again following the end of restrictions."	false
0	High incidence and mortality of pneumothorax in critically Ill patients with COVID-19. Background: The clinical characteristics of the patients with COVID-19 complicated by pneumothorax have not been clarified. Objectives: To determine the epidemiology and risks of pneumothorax in the critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: Retrospectively collecting and analysing medical records, laboratory findings, chest X-ray and CT images of 5 patients complicated by pneumothorax. Results: The incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (5/49) in patients with ARDS, 24% (5/21) in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and 56% (5/9) in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, with 80% (4/ 5) patients died. All the 5 patients were male and aged ranging from 54 to 79 years old. Pneumothorax was most likely to occur 2 weeks after the beginning of dyspnea and associated with reduction of neuromuscular blockers, recruitment maneuver, severe cough, changes of lung structure and function. Conclusions: Pneumothorax is a frequent and fatal complication of critically ill patients with COVID-19. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 on adult burn management in the UK: a regional centre experience. In this study, the authors aim to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on burns provision at an adult regional burn centre. Two cohorts of patients were identified for comparison: one during the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020 and a comparator cohort in April 2019. There was a 30% decrease in the incidence of adult burns in 2020. The mean total body surface area (TBSA) was 1.8% and 4.3% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Scald injuries were the commonest mechanism of burns in both cohorts. Depth of burns were deeper in 2019, with 17.6% of patients presenting with deep burns, compared with 9.6% in 2020. 8% of patients in 2019 required theatre compared with zero patients in 2020. A similar percentage of patients were admitted in both cohorts. In 2019, admitted patients had an average inpatient stay of 0.57 days per TBSA. In 2020, the average stay per TBSA in all patients was 0.6 days and 1.5 days in survivors. In the lockdown period, 54% of patients were followed up by telemedicine. This difficult period has taught us how important a functioning healthcare system is and how we can be better prepared in the future. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

In April 2020 consensus statement on LC screening advised deferring enrollment in LC screening and modified the evaluation of nodules. This single institution has had an active LC screening program before COVID, which enrolled more than 300 patients per month before COVID and completed more than 11,000 screens over the last six years. Kentucky is the state with the highest LC mortality rate in the US and one of the highest smoking rates in the country. Government directed social distancing was put in place 3/14/2020. Method(s): LC Screening Registry data 2015-2020 for St Elizabeth Healthcare (SEH) was accessed. The lung cancer screening volumes listed until May 2020 were recorded and graphically illustrated using polynomial trendlines and well as monthly point by point lines. John Hopkin's COVID Status Report on Kentucky's and SEH surrounding counties confirmed cases, fatality rate and number of tested patients. Result(s): By June 2020, Kentucky (pop 4.6m) had 13.630 confirmed COVID cases, 524 deaths and a 3.84% fatality rate with 317,161 tests performed. SEH's surrounding counties, (pop 370k) had 386 cases per 100k population and a 4.5 % county fatality rate with 71 deaths. The county with the highest rate in the county at the time was Cook county, IL, (pop 5,2m) with 1,711 cases per 100k population and 4,500 deaths due to COVID. 379 LC screens were performed at SEH in February 2020. 212 in March and 13 LC screens in April, 114 in May. The lung cancer rate in the screened population has been 1.81% over the course of six years. Conclusion(s): The consensus statement on LC screening during COVID advised a delay in LC screening, work up and treatment, even for high probability nodules and stage 1 lung cancers. A delay of LC screens in this community setting by 6 months would delay the diagnosis and treatment of 36 lung cancer cases. The course of the COVID pandemic is presently uncertain. Considering the fact that COVID will affect health care for the foreseeable future, it would be helpful to modify the recommendations based on the area's prevalence of COVID and prevalence of lung cancer.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Social, Cognitive, and eHealth Mechanisms of COVID-19-Related Lockdown and Mandatory Quarantine That Potentially Affect the Mental Health of Pregnant Women in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. Background: Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine measures have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease of the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns have been raised over the threat that these measures pose to mental health, especially the mental health of vulnerable groups, including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective(s): This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. Method(s): An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. Result(s): Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (?2 14=495.21; P<.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; ?=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; ?=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. Conclusion(s): Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

0	Myocardial infarction rates overview during COVID-19 pandemic In France: Results of the MODIF registry. Background: The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. Systems of care have been reorganized worldwide in an effort to preserve hospital bed capacity. In France, from March 17 to May 11 2020, government imposed a complete lockdown on the whole population. Only urgent cardiac procedures have been ensured such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) revascularization. Some previously published studies suggest a reduction of admission for STEMI in many countries. Nevertheless, strong evidences and data across different French regions that have been affected variously by the outbreak are still lacking. Purpose(s): We aimed to describe the incidence rates and characteristics of patients presenting with STEMI in order to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on STEMI care in France covering the lockdown period compared to same period one year ago. Method(s): We performed a retrospective multicenter registry across 60 French interventional cardiology centers including all consecutive STEMI patients referred for urgent revascularization in the heart catheterization laboratory between two periods: March 1st to May 31th 2020 compared with March 1st to May 31th 2019. Comprehensive data, including clinical, biological, COVID status and angiographic variables including time taken for care were recorded at admission. The primary outcome was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation support or in-hospital death. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of myocardial infarction related complications during hospitalization. Enrollement is not complete at the time of the abstract submission. Conclusion(s): This data collection between two periods with and without COVID19 will gave insights for a complete descriptive cartography of STEMI patients among different French regions which have been variously impacted by the outbreak.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"Correlation between Micronutrient plasma concentration and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Objectives: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of betacoronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which leads to mild to severe symptoms. Micronutrients in blood serum, namely, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium, play essential roles in the human body's various organs. This study investigates the association between micronutrient levels and the severity of symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Method(s): A cross-section study was conducted during June-August 2020 in Riyadh city among 80 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within 24 hours of hospital admission, patients have been divided into non-severe and severe cases, and blood samples were drawn from each patient to measure the serum levels of copper, iron ""in the form of ferritin,"" selenium, and zinc. Result(s): In both study groups, the mean copper and selenium serum levels were within the normal range, while the mean zinc and iron serum levels were elevated. A statistically significant difference was recorded between non-severe and severe cases regarding serum levels of iron and selenium (331.24 vs. 1174.95 ng/ml and 134 vs. 162 mcg/L, respectively, P < 0.0001). On the other hand, no significant difference was detected between both studied groups regarding serum level of zinc and copper (124.57 vs. 116.37 mcq/L and 18.35 vs. 18.2 mcmol/L, respectively, P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): There was a significant elevation of selenium and iron serum levels among severe cases compared to non-severe cases of COVID-19. High levels of iron and selenium could be correlated with the disease severity during infection with SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Particles Using Direct, Reagent-Free Electrochemical Sensing. The development of new methods for direct viral detection using streamlined and ideally reagent-free assays is a timely and important, but challenging, problem. The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.	false
0	"Grab 'n' go: An express STI testing clinic in Scotland in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual health clinics have had to make rapid changes in service provision. To reduce Face to Face (F2F) contact, patients with mild symptoms indicative of an STI but not requiring examination were offered a ""grab kit"" appointment. Patients identified on phone triage were advised to attend at allocated times to collect an assigned STI testing kit at reception, self-sample, then drop it in a box on exit. An on-duty HCA collected blood samples if this was requested. Method(s): Data was gathered from our IT system NaSH. For a snapshot period of 36 days we examined demographics, number of attendances, DNAs, presenting complaint, positive STI tests and subsequent follow-up appointments. Result(s): 402 appointments made, 59 (14.7%) DNA'd. 209 identified as female (60.9%). The most common age group was 20-24, accounting for 30% of all tests. 263 (76.7%) were heterosexual, 40 (11.7%) were MSM. The most common presenting complaints were change in vaginal discharge (68, 19.8%), dysuria (53, 15.5%), PV bleeding (38, 14%) and being an STI contact (27, 7.9%). We identified 24 cases of CT (7% prevalence) and 4 (1% prevalence) cases of GC. 61 (17.8%) blood tests were performed, no new HIV or syphilis identified. Excluding routine follow-up for an STI diagnosis, 27 (7.9%) of patients went on to have a further telephone triage due to ongoing symptoms. Only 10 (2.9%) were subsequently booked in for F2F assessment. Discussion(s): We have shown that F2F appointments can be avoided without compromising care by minimal contact clinics such as these. Due to the limited service in recent months, many of these patients may not have presented themselves without the ""grab kit"" appointments and several STIs could have been missed."	false
0	Public Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccination Drive in India. The vaccination drive for prevention against COVID-19 in India started from 16th January 2021. Two vaccines used for this drive are Oxford-AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Covishield and Bharat Biotech&rsquo;s Covaxin. This drive has already crossed 600,000 mark in first four days and the government has stated that the drive will be further accelerated in coming days to ensure immunity to the citizens of the country. However, there is a section of the community which is still skeptical to the COVID-19 vaccination. This research work has been conducted to analyze the sentiments in the tweets posted in India regarding these two vaccines. The analysis shows that while a majority of the population is posting with positive sentiments towards these vaccines, there are also negative sentiments associated with them, associated with the emotions such as fear and anger.	false
0	Co-infection of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort study. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across the world and is responsible for over 1,686,267 deaths worldwide. Co-infection with influenza A virus (IFV-A) during the upcoming flu season may complicate diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Little is known about epidemiology and outcomes of co-infection. Data for 213 COVID-19 patients treated at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 28, 2020 to March 24, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Ninety-seven of the patients (45.5%) tested positive for anti- IFV-A immunoglobulin M antibodies. The clinical characteristics were described and analyzed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection only and patients with SARS-CoV-2/IFV-A co-infection. Patients with co-infection showed similar patterns of symptoms and clinical outcomes to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection only. However, an increased expression of serum cytokines (interleukin-2R [IL-2R], IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and cardiac troponin I, and higher incidence of lymphadenopathy were observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection only. Male patients and patients aged less than 60 years in the SARS-CoV-2 infection group also had significantly higher computed tomography scores than patients in co-infection group, indicating that co-infection with IFV-A had no effect on the disease outcome but alleviated inflammation in certain populations of COVID-19 patients. The study will provide a reference for diagnosing and treating IFV-A and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection cases in the upcoming flu season.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	More than just contraception: the impact of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on public health over 30 years. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health services is essential to facilitate the empowerment of women and achievement of gender equality. Increasing access to modern methods of contraception can reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy and decrease maternal mortality. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) offer high contraceptive efficacy as well as cost-efficacy, providing benefits for both women and healthcare systems. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) first became available in 1990 with the introduction of Mirena (LNG-IUS 20), a highly effective contraceptive which can reduce menstrual blood loss and provide other therapeutic benefits. The impact of the LNG-IUS on society has been wide ranging, including decreasing the need for abortion, reducing the number of surgical sterilisation procedures performed, as well as reducing the number of hysterectomies carried out for issues such as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mirena can provide a treatment option for women with gynaecological issues such as HMB without organic pathology, minimising exposure to the hospital environment and reducing waiting times for surgical appointments. Looking to the future, research and development in the field of the LNG-IUS continues to expand our understanding of these contraceptives in clinical practice and offers the potential to further expand the choices available to women, allowing them to select the option that best meets their needs.

0	Prognostic value of serum procalcitonin in covid-19 patients: A systematic review. Background: This study is aimed at reviewing the published literature on the prognostic role of serum procalcitonin (PCT) in COVID-19 cases. Data retrieval: We systematically reviewed the literature available on PubMed, MEDLINE, LitCovid NLM, and WHO: to assess the utility of PCT in prognosis of coronavirus disease. Scrutiny for eligible studies comprising articles that have evaluated the prognostic utility of PCT and data compilation was undertaken by two separate investigators. Original articles in human subjects reporting the prognostic role of PCT in adult COVID-19 patients were included. The Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was utilized to assess the strength of evidence. Results were reported as narrative syntheses. Result(s): Out of the total 426 citations, 52 articles passed through screening. The quality of evidence and methodology of included studies was overall acceptable. The total sample size of the studies comprised of 15,296 COVID-19-positive subjects. Majority of the studies were from China, i.e., 40 (77%). The PCT cut-off utilized was 0.05 ng/mL by 18 (35%) studies, followed by 0.5 ng/mL by 9 (17.5%). Eighty five percent (n = 44) studies reported statistically significant association (p value < 0.05) between PCT and severity. Conclusion(s): Procalcitonin appears as a promising prognostic biomarker of COVID-19 progression in conjunction with the clinical context.Copyright © The Author(s).	false
0	Placental SARS-CoV-2 in a pregnant woman with mild COVID-19 disease. The full impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pregnancy remains uncharacterized. Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women. We present a case of placental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in a woman with mild COVID-19 disease, then review the literature. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. A 29-year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias 2 days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate maternal vascular malperfusion, with no fetal vascular malperfusion, as well as SARS-CoV-2 virus in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and also rarely in trophoblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental SARS-CoV-2 despite mild COVID-19 disease (no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy complications) and possible vertical transmission-especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. This raises important questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing throughout pregnancy.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Global Imperative of Suicidal Ideation in 10 Countries Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a detrimental impact on individuals' psychological well-being; however, a multi-country comparison on the prevalence of suicidal ideation due to the virus is still lacking. Objectives: To examine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among the general population across 10 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study which used convenience sampling and collected data by conducting an online survey. Participants were sourced from 10 Eastern and Western countries. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure the outcome variable of suicidal ideation. Ordinal regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: A total of 25,053 participants (22.7% male) were recruited. Results from the analysis showed that the UK and Brazil had the lowest odds of suicidal ideation compared to Macau (p < 0.05). Furthermore, younger age, male, married, and differences in health beliefs were significantly associated with suicidal ideation (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for joint international collaboration to formulate effective suicide prevention strategies in a timely manner and the need to implement online mental health promotion platforms. In doing so, the potential global rising death rates by suicide during the pandemic can be reduced.

0	Serum Renin Levels Increase With Age in Boys Resulting in Higher Renin Levels in Young Men Compared to Young Women, and Soluble Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Correlates With Renin and Body Mass Index. Background: Age, sex, and body constitution may affect the shedding of membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (mACE2) and lead to a relative mACE2 deficiency. However, it is unclear if differences, reflected by serum renin levels, exist in the basal renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) between children and adults, boys, and girls as well as young women and young men. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated if renin and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) levels are correlated with body mass index (BMI) in children and young adults. The aim of this observational study was to assess age-and sex differences in serum renin, and the relationship between renin, soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and body mass index in a prospectively followed population-based cohort of children which were followed into young adulthood. Study Design:  We analyzed renin and sACE2 in serum in a prospectively followed population-based cohort at 9.9 (0.6) [mean (SD)] (n = 173), 11.7 (0.6) (n = 156), 14.8 (0.8) (n = 149), 18.8 (0.3) (n = 93), and 23.5 (0.7) (n = 152) years of age. Height (cm) and weight (kg) was measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Sex-related differences in renin levels were calculated using analysis of covariance, adjusted for age. Correlations were assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient (R 2) using a multivariable linear mixed model. Results: Both sexes had low renin levels up to 12 years of age. Thereafter renin levels increased more in boys than in girls. Males from the age of 15 had significantly higher levels than females (p < 0.001). There was a positive linear relationship between renin and sACE2 levels in male and female subjects (p < 0.001), and between sACE2 levels and BMI in males (p < 0.001). Conclusion:  Renin levels increase with age, are higher in men than in women since around puberty, and are correlated with sACE2 levels. Furthermore, sACE2 levels are correlated with body mass index in males. These findings indicate that high renin levels in males and females and a high BMI in males may activate pathways which increase the shedding of mACE2, with possible implications for the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019.

0	COVID-19 Incidence in Patients With Immunomediated Inflammatory Diseases: Influence of Immunosuppressant Treatments. The effect of immunosuppressant treatments on the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. We studied the association between the pre-exposure to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that decrease immunological responses and the incidence of COVID-19 to explore the possible effects of these treatments in early manifestations of the disease. For this purpose, we performed a cross-sectional study including 2,494 patients with immunomediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) recruited at the outpatient Rheumatology, Dermatology and Gastroenterology services of Hospital del Mar. The primary outcome was the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 performed by a physician at the hospital or at the primary care center, from the March 1-29, 2020. Multivariable Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate COVID-19 relative risk (RR) adjusted by comorbidities. We revealed that biological (RR = 0.46, CI 95% = 0.31-0.67) and synthetic (RR = 0.62, CI 95% = 0.43-0.91) DMARDs used in IMIDs diminished the incidence of COVID-19. Striking sex differences were revealed with anti-TNF alpha compounds (RR = 0.50, CI 95% = 0.33-0.75) with higher effects in women (RR = 0.33, CI 95% = 0.17-0.647). Treatment with low glucocorticoid doses also revealed sex differences decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 predominantly in women (RR = 0.72, CI 95% = 0.42-1.22). Our results report a decreased incidence of COVID-19 in patients receiving specific DMARDs with different immunodepressor mechanisms with striking sex differences. These results underline the interest of repurposing specific DMARDs for the possibility of minimizing the severity of disease progression in the early stages of COVID-19.	false
0	Stapled ACE2 peptidomimetics designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein do not prevent virus internalization. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Virus cell entry is mediated through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A series of stapled peptide ACE2 peptidomimetics based on the ACE2 interaction motif were designed to bind the coronavirus S-protein RBD and inhibit binding to the human ACE2 receptor. The peptidomimetics were assessed for antiviral activity in an array of assays including a neutralization pseudovirus assay, immunofluorescence (IF) assay and in-vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. However, none of the peptidomimetics showed activity in these assays, suggesting that an enhanced binding interface is required to outcompete ACE2 for S-protein RBD binding and prevent virus internalization.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Spatial distribution characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with environmental factors. Investigating the spatial distribution characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and exploring the influence of environmental factors that drive it is the basis for formulating rational and efficient prevention and control countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with the environmental factors. Based on the incidences of new local COVID-19 cases in Beijing from June 11 to July 5, the spatial clustering characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing was investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The relation between COVID-19 cases and environmental factors was assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explore the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the development of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing from June 11 to July 5 could be divided into two stages. The first stage was the outward expansion from June 11 to June 21, and the second stage (from June 22 to July 5) was the growth of the transmission in areas with existing previous cases. In addition, there was a ring of low value clusters around the Xinfadi market. This area was the key area for prevention and control. Population density and distance to Xinfadi market were the most critical factors that explained the pandemic development. The findings of this study can provide useful information for the global fighting against COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Tele-ICUs for COVID-19: A Look at National Prevalence and Characteristics of Hospitals Providing Teleintensive Care. PURPOSE: Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of intensive care unit telemedicine (tele-ICUs) may be one mechanism to provide patient care, particularly in rural parts of the United States. The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHOD(S): We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states. Future work should continue the evaluation of tele-ICU effectiveness and, if favorable, explore the variation we identified for improved access to teleintensive care.Copyright © 2020 National Rural Health Association.	false
0	Comparison of Upper Respiratory Viral Load Distributions in Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Children Diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pediatric Hospital Testing Programs. The distribution of upper respiratory viral loads (VL) in asymptomatic children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We assessed PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and estimated VL in infected asymptomatic children diagnosed in nine pediatric hospital testing programs. Records for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with positive clinical SARS-CoV-2 tests were reviewed. Ct values were (i) adjusted by centering each value around the institutional median Ct value from symptomatic children tested with that assay and (ii) converted to estimated VL (numbers of copies per milliliter) using internal or manufacturer data. Adjusted Ct values and estimated VL for asymptomatic versus symptomatic children (118 asymptomatic versus 197 symptomatic children aged 0 to 4 years, 79 asymptomatic versus 97 symptomatic children aged 5 to 9 years, 69 asymptomatic versus 75 symptomatic children aged 10 to 13 years, 73 asymptomatic versus 109 symptomatic children aged 14 to 17 years) were compared. The median adjusted Ct value for asymptomatic children was 10.3 cycles higher than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001), and VL were 3 to 4 logs lower than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001); differences were consistent (P < 0.0001) across all four age brackets. These differences were consistent across all institutions and by sex, ethnicity, and race. Asymptomatic children with diabetes (odds ratio (On 6.5; P = 0.01), a recent contact (OR, 2.3; P = 0.02), and testing for surveillance (OR, 2.7; P = 0.005) had higher estimated risks of having a Ct value in the lowest quartile than children without, while an immunocompromised status had no effect. Children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower levels of virus in their nasopharynx/oropharynx than symptomatic children, but the timing of infection relative to diagnosis likely impacted levels in asymptomatic children. Caution is recommended when choosing diagnostic tests for screening of asymptomatic children.	false
0	Development of spike receptor-binding domain nanoparticle as a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling H. pylori -bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. 16-20 months-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD-nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD-nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious viruses in nasal washes and lungs as well as viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study demonstrates the Spike RBD-nanoparticle as an effective protein vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: a double-blind, randomised, phase 1 trial. BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed. BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel)., METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 mug with Algel-IMDG, 6 mug with Algel-IMDG, or 6 mug with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519)., FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10.5-26.1) participants in the 3 mug with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13.8-30.5) in the 6 mug with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8.1-22.7) in the 6 mug with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6.9-23.6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 mug with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87.9, 91.9, and 82.8 in the 3 mug with Algel-IMDG, 6 mug with Algel-IMDG, and 6 mug with Algel groups, respectively. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups., INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted., FUNDING: Bharat Biotech International. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

0	Magnetic Bead-Based Immunoassay Allows Rapid, Inexpensive, and Quantitative Detection of Human SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies. Immunological methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans are important to track COVID-19 cases and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infections and immunization to future vaccines. The aim of this work was to develop a simple chromogenic magnetic bead-based immunoassay which allows rapid, inexpensive, and quantitative detection of human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum, plasma, or blood. Recombinant 6xHis-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein was mobilized on the surface of Ni2+ magnetic beads and challenged with serum or blood samples obtained from controls or COVID-19 cases. The beads were washed, incubated with anti-human IgG-HPR conjugate, and immersed into a solution containing a chromogenic HPR substrate. Bead transfer and homogenization between solutions was aided by a simple low-cost device. The method was validated by two independent laboratories, and the performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans was in the same range as obtained using the gold standard immunoassays ELISA and Luminex, though requiring only a fraction of consumables, instrumentation, time to deliver results, and volume of sample. Furthermore, the results obtained with the method described can be visually interpreted without compromising accuracy as demonstrated by validation at a point-of-care unit. The magnetic bead immunoassay throughput can be customized on demand and is readily adapted to be used with any other 6xHis tagged protein or peptide as antigen to track other diseases.	false
0	A high-throughput Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing platform for COVID-19. Background: Serology tests for detecting the antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can identify previous infection and help to confirm the presence of current infection. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody detection. Results: Clinical agreement studies were performed in 107 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 226 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 46.15 % (95 % CI: 19.22 %-74.87 %), 61.54 % (95 % CI: 31.58 %-86.14 %), and 97.53 % (95 % CI: 91.36 %-99.70 %) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and >= 15 days from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 98.23 % (95 % CI: 95.53 %-99.52 %). No cross-reactivity was observed to patient samples positive for IgG antibodies against the following pathogens: HIV, HAV, HBV, RSV, CMV, EBV, Rubella, Influenza A, and Influenza B. Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. Conclusion: An anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing.	false
0	A Streamlined Whole Blood CyTOF Workflow Defines A Circulating Immune Cell Signature of COVID-19. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) represents one of the most powerful tools in immune phenotyping, allowing high throughput quantification of over 40 parameters at single-cell resolution. However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining, and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We apply this workflow to characterize 184 whole blood samples collected longitudinally from a cohort of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, highlighting dynamic disease-associated changes in circulating immune cell frequency and phenotype.

0	Broad and potent activity against SARS-like viruses by an engineered human monoclonal antibody. The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures. We employed a directed evolution approach to engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) and neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with high potency. Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a distinct angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In immunocompetent mouse models of SARS and COVID-19, prophylactic administration of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate against clade 1 sarbecoviruses.

0	Successful return to professional men's football (soccer) competition after the COVID-19 shutdown: a cohort study in the German Bundesliga. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the restart of the German Bundesliga (football (soccer)) during the COVID-19 pandemic from a medical perspective. METHOD(S): Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions-early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. FINDINGS: Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. CONCLUSION(S): Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires strict hygiene measures including regular PCR testing.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

0	Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with empagliflozin use in the course of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are among the new generation oral anti-diabetic drugs that have started to be used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although these drugs are highly beneficial, life-threatening side effects such as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eDKA) are reported with their use. In eDKA, metabolic acidosis and anion gap appear in blood gases and serum glucose in less than 200 mg/dl. This can delay diagnosis and treatment. In our case, a 42-year female presented to the Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting. It was observed that the patient had been using empagliflozin for a year. Her blood gas analyses and laboratory tests showed metabolic acidosis and ketosis. The patient was initially suspected to be a case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) complicating the course of diabetes, finally it was diagnosed as a case of eDKA due to empagliflozin use. We noticed that during the current pandemic, some other diagnoses can be missed or their diagnosis can be delayed.Copyright © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

0	Key issues in emergency department management of COVID-19: Proposals for improving care for patients in Latin America. The incidence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Latin America and Spain and its impact particularly on hospital emergency departments have been great, sustained, and unpredictable. Unfortunately, this situation will continue in the medium term, regardless of the diverse concepts and definitions used to identify cases or hypotheses about the role of staff. In the context of the worldwide pandemic, a multinational group of experts from the Latin American Working Group to Improve Care for Patients With Infection (GT-LATINFURG) has drafted various opinion papers for use by emergency care systems in the member countries. The GT-LATINFURG is comprised of representatives from the 13 scientific associations affiliated with the Latin American Federation for Emergency Medicine (FLAME). Experts from the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (SEMES) also participated. The present consensus statement offers protocols and recommendations to facilitate the work of hospital emergency departments with regard to key issues the group identified, namely, the need for reorganization, triage, and routine test availability. Additional issues discussed include biomarkers; clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and microbiologic criteria for identifying patients with COVID-19; and risk and prognostic factors for mortality that emergency staff can use to quickly detect severe cases in our settings.Copyright © 2021, Saned.

0	Imaging Mass Cytometric Analysis of Postmortem Tissues Reveals Dysregulated Immune Cell and Cytokine Responses in Multiple Organs of COVID-19 Patients. SARS-coronavirus-2-induced immune dysregulation and inflammatory responses are involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, very little is known about immune cell and cytokine alterations in specific organs of COVID-19 patients. Here, we evaluated immune cells and cytokines in postmortem tissues, i.e., lungs, intestine, liver, kidneys, and spleen of three patients with COVID-19. Imaging mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19, natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs also infiltrated the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression was higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19 patients (compared to levels in controls). Collectively, these findings suggested that IL-10 and TNF-alpha as immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively,-might be prognostic and could serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.© Copyright © 2020 Wang, Xu, Wang, Pan, Zhang, Han, Huang, Wu, Yang, Yang, Yang, Shu, Zou, Li, Luo, Yao, Wang, Qiu, Wang, Zhang, Yao, Yan, Zhou and Shang.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection Among US Dialysis Patients: Risk Factors and Outcomes From a National Dialysis Provider. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving maintenance dialysis are a highly vulnerable population due to their comorbidities and circumstances that limit physical distancing during treatment. This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider., PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications., OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19., ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19., RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality., LIMITATIONS: No distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings. Among maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, mortality is high, exceeding 20%. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Early outcomes of Stanford type A aortic dissection under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A multicentre study from Hubei province. Objectives: Our goal was to compare the short-term outcomes of Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD), during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with those during normal times and summarize our perioperative management experience of patients with TAAD in the context of COVID-19. Method(s): From 17 January 2020 to 8 March 2020, a total of 27 patients with TAAD were operated on in 8 cardiovascular surgery centres in Hubei Province (COVID-19 group). The data from 91 patients with TAAD from the same centres during the same period last year were extracted from the Hubei Cardiac Surgery Registration System (control group). A propensity score matched subgroup of 26 pairs (1:2) was identified. Perioperative data and short-term outcomes were assessed. Result(s): Nine patients in the COVID-19 group were categorized as suspicious for the disease (9/27, 33.3%), and others were excluded (18/27, 66.7%). No one was laboratory confirmed preoperatively. The average waiting, cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times were longer in the COVID-19 group (22.9 +/- 8.3 vs 9.7 +/- 4.0 h, P < 0.001; 135 +/- 36 vs 103 +/- 45 min, P = 0.003; 24 +/- 9 vs 17 +/- 8 min, P < 0.001, respectively). The 30-day or in-hospital deaths were 3.8% in both groups (P = 1.0). The COVID-19 group was associated with longer ventilation and intensive care unit times (81 +/- 71 vs 45 +/- 19 h, P < 0.001; 7.4 +/- 3.8 vs 4.5 +/- 2.7 days; P < 0.001, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications such as stroke, neurological deficit, acute kidney injury, pulmonary infection and reoperation. Serum antibody tests for those patients showed 7 out of 9 suspected cases were Immunoglobulin G positive. No cross-infection occurred in other patients or associated medical staff. Conclusion(s): With adequate preparation and appropriate protection, satisfactory early outcomes can be achieved after emergency operations for patients with TAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Venous thromboembolism in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. Background: Systemic coagulation activation and thrombotic complications are frequent among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Limited data are available in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Purpose(s): To determine the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Method(s): We studied consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to general ward at Strasbourg Hospital, France (25.02.2020-19.04.2020). The primary outcome was any VTE complication. The secondary outcome was the composite of death or transfer to ICU. Result(s): Among the 289 patients included (62.2 +/- 17.0 years, 59.2% male), VTE occurred in 49 (17.0%). Padua prediction score for VTE was similar between VTE and non-VTE patients. VTE imaging tests were performed in 100 (34.6%) patients and VTE diagnosed in median 7 (3-11) days after admission. On-admission, time from symptom onset to admission (OR 1.07, CI 95% [1.00-1.16], P = 0.045), Improve score (OR 1.37, [1.02-1.83], P = 0.032), leukocyte count (OR 1.16, [1.06-1.27], P = 0.001) and lack of thromboprophylaxis (OR 27.85, CI 95% [9.35-82.95], P < 0.001) were independent predictors of VTE. The incidence of the composite of death or ICU transfer was 31.0% and more frequent among patients with VTE (47.9% vs. 27.9%, P = 0.01). Fever (OR 5.37, CI 95% [1.44-19.97], P = 0.012), VTE (OR 3.44, CI 95% [1.63-7.25], P = 0.001), lymphopenia (OR 0.32, 95% CI [0.15-0.71]; P = 0.005) and extent of COVID-19 evaluated by chest CT severity (OR 1.56, 95% CI [1.12-2.16]; P = 0.007) were independently associated with in-hospital death or transfer to ICU (Table 1, Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): The 17.0% incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients with COVID-19 was associated with worse outcomes. Given the high incidence of VTE in ward patients, there is an urgent need to investigate the optimal anticoagulation regimen.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Human SARS CoV-2 spike protein mutations. The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID-19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 A interacting distance from the ACE-2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three-dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Pasylated thymosin alpha1: A long-acting immunostimulatory peptide for applications in oncology and virology. Thymosin alpha1 (Talpha1) is an immunostimulatory peptide for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and used as an immune enhancer, which also offers prospects in the context of COVID-19 infections and cancer. Manufacturing of this N-terminally acetylated 28-residue peptide is demanding, and its short plasma half-life limits in vivo efficacy and requires frequent dosing. Here, we combined the PASylation technology with enzymatic in situ N-acetylation by RimJ to produce a long-acting version of Talpha1 in Escherichia coli at high yield. ESI-MS analysis of the purified fusion protein indicated the expected composition without any signs of proteolysis. SEC analysis revealed a 10-fold expanded hydrodynamic volume resulting from the fusion with a conformationally disordered Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) polypeptide of 600 residues. This size effect led to a plasma half-life in rats extended by more than a factor 8 compared to the original synthetic peptide due to retarded kidney filtration. Our study provides the basis for therapeutic development of a next generation thymosin alpha1 with prolonged circulation. Generally, the strategy of producing an N-terminally protected PASylated peptide solves three major problems of peptide drugs: (i) instability in the expression host, (ii) rapid degradation by serum exopeptidases, and (iii) low bioactivity because of fast renal clearance.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Level of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 activity is highly elevated in old-aged patients with aortic stenosis: implications for ACE2 as a biomarker for the severity of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a high mortality in elderly patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. The cellular receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby implicating a link between cardiovascular diseases and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Aortic stenosis (AS) represents a chronic inflammatory state with severe cardiovascular complications in the elderly, a prime condition for COVID-19 mortality. The circulating ACE2 levels were measured in 111 patients with severe AS and compared to patients with hypertension and healthy individuals. About 4 times higher circulating ACE2 activity was found in patients with severe AS than in hypertensives or healthy individuals (88.3 +/- 61.6., n = 111, 20.6 +/- 13.4, n = 540, and 16.1 +/- 7.4 mU/L, n = 46, respectively). Patients with severe AS were older than patients with hypertension (80 +/- 6 years vs. 60 +/- 15 years, P < 0.05). Serum ACE2 activity correlated negatively with the left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic root area, TAPSE, and positively with the right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiac diameters in patients with AS. In contrast, circulating ACE2 activity was independent of the blood pressure, peak flow velocity at the aortic root, kidney function (GFR), and inflammatory state (CRP). We found no effect of RAAS inhibitory drugs on the serum ACE2 activity in this group of patients. Our results illustrate circulating ACE2 as a potential interface between chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 susceptibility. Elderly patients with AS have markedly elevated ACE2 levels together with altered left and right ventricular functions, which may pose higher risks during COVID-19. Our clinical data do not support a role for RAAS inhibitors in regulating circulating ACE2 levels.	false
0	A Discussion on Implementing Pooling Detection Tests of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Large Population. A pooled sample analysis strategy for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is proposed for large population in this paper. The population to be tested is divided into divisions based on earlier observed detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 first. Samples collected are then grouped in appropriate pooled size. The number of tests per person in that population is expressed as a function of two variables: The observed detection rate and the pooled size or number of samples grouped. The minimum number of tests per person can be further shown to be a function of only one of these two variables, because these two parameters are found to be related at this minimum. A management scheme on grouping the samples is proposed in order to reduce the number of tests, to save time, which is of utmost importance in fighting epidemic. The proposed testing scheme will be useful for supporting the government in making decisions to handle regular routine detection tests for identifying asymptomatic patients and implementing health code system in large population of millions of citizens. Another important point is to use smaller number of test kits, allowing more resources to speed up the mass screening tests, particularly in places not so rich.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

0	The Impact of COVID-19 on In-Hospital Outcomes of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is one of the important clinical procedures that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess the incidence and impact of COVID-19 on in-hospital clinical outcome of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients managed with PPCI. This observational retrospective study was conducted on consecutive STEMI patients who presented to the International Cardiac Center (ICC) hospital, Alexandria, Egypt between 1 February and 31 October 2020. A group of STEMI patients presented during the same period in 2019 was also assessed (control group) and data was used for comparison. The inclusion criteria were established diagnosis of STEMI requiring PPCI.A total of 634 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 period, the number of PPCI procedures was reduced by 25.7% compared with previous year (mean 30.0 +/- 4.01 vs. 40.4 +/- 5.3 case/month) and the time from first medical contact to Needle (FMC-to-N) was longer (125.0 +/- 53.6 vs. 52.6 +/- 22.8 min, p = 0.001). Also, during COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality was higher (7.4 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.036) as was the incidence of re-infarction (12.2 vs. 7.7%, p = 0.041) and the need for revascularization (15.9 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.046). The incidence of heart failure, stroke, and bleeding was not different between groups, but hospital stay was longer during COVID-19 (6.85 +/- 4.22 vs. 3.5 +/- 2.3 day, p = 0.0025). Conclusion : At the ICC, COVID-19 pandemic contributed significantly to the PPCI management of STEMI patients with decreased number and delayed procedures. COVID-19 was also associated with higher in-hospital mortality, rate of re-infarction, need for revascularization, and longer hospital stay.	false
0	ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF DERMATOVENEROLOGICAL SERVICE DEVELOPMENT: OPINION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. OBJECTIVE: The aim: To determine the features and trends of dermatovenerological health of population; to identify conditions and problems of providing dermatovenerological care., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Bibliographic, epidemiological, medico-statistical, sociological methods were used. Scientific literature, data from the Center of Medical Statistics of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine concerning population health and dermatovenerological establishments activity on 2000-2019, data of authors` own sociological researches on opinion of dermatovenerological profile experts about available problems and ways of their decision were analyzed., RESULTS: Results: A long-term tendency towards a decrease in the incidence of skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases by 8,6% during 2000-2017 and the incidence of venereal diseases during 2000-2019 was revealed (for syphilis - by 15,5 times, gonorrhea - by 6,8 times). At the same time, during 2014-2019 there was an increase in the incidence of atopic dermatitis by 3,6%, of contact dermatitis - by 5,2%, of trichophytia and microsporia by 22,6%, as well as increase in the prevalence of psoriasis - by 6,0%. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases remains significant. Trends in recent years indicate a deterioration in dermatological health and an increasing need for medical services. During healthcare reforming over the course of nineteen years there was a reduction in the amount of dermatovenerologists and their number per population by 31,5%, the amount of dermatological institutions - by 2,6 times and beds - by 3,9 times. According to 18,6+/-3,1 per 100 surveyed respondents, the availability of dermatovenerological care to the population is low, and its deterioration in the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed by 80,1+/-4,0. Some factors that negatively affect the quality of medical services have been identified: insufficient amount and quality of medical equipment (57,1+/-4,0 per 100 respondents), insufficient opportunity for continuous professional development (34,0+/-3,8); lack of computers (30,8+/-3,7); lack of motivation to improve the quality of work (28,8+/-3,6). The priority measures that need to be taken to improve dermatovenerological medical services have been identified., CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The study of dermatovenerological profile experts` opinion regarding the current state of the dermatovenerological service, human resources, the availability and quality of the services made it possible to identify a number of organizational and administrative problems as well as to prioritize activities on providing dermatovenerological care to the population in the context of healthcare reform and COVID-19 pandemic.	false

To Track the source of the infection through an investigation of a clustering of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), and provide scientific basis and Strategy for the effective control of the aggregated epidemic situation of COVID-19. Field epidemiological method was used to survey the cases and related close contacts in a family clustering epidemic of COVID-19 in Dandong city of Liaoning Province. We obtained survey data for a descriptive analysis.Real time RT-PCR technique was used to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in samples collected from cases and related close contacts combined with serum specific antibody detection. A total of 3 confirmed cases and 2 asymptomatic infection cases were discovered in the clustering epidemic, with 34 close contacts.Of eight close family contacts visiting from other province, one patient was on the same flight as the confirmed case, and her antibody IgG was positive. The family clustering was caused by past infection case who visited her friend through Wuhan from other provinces to local area.	false
0	Bronchial carcinoid with bronchocele masquerading as Scimitar syndrome on chest radiograph. Bronchial carcinoid tumors occur predominantly in the perihilar location and can be asymptomatic. They may present in early stages with only obstructive features such as mucus plugging of airways resulting in bronchocele formation. We report the case of a 44-year lady with no chest complaints, who underwent chest radiograph for a routine preanesthetic checkup. A vertically oriented, tubular, soft tissue density lesion was observed in the right lower lung, which mimicked a Scimitar vein. Scimitar syndrome is a congenital disorder in which an anomalous vein drains the middle and lower lobes of right lung and enters into the IVC most commonly. It may present asymptomatically in adults and on chest radiograph appears as a vertical tubular opacity paralleling the right cardiac border. However, CT angiography revealed the lung lesion to be a bronchocele, distal to a central intensely enhancing spherical mass, completely occluding the right lower lobe bronchus. This perihilar mass had been missed on the chest radiograph. Bronchoscopic biopsy revealed a carcinoid tumor. As the patient was asymptomatic, she refused surgery in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021	false
0	Prevalence, intensity and manifestation of covid-19 fear: A cross sectional analysis. Background: Pandemics are direct antecedent of distinctive physical, psychological, social and financial impacts. A large number of researches are being conducted regarding previous epidemics and pandemics and lot more is currently in progress vis-avis COVID-19. The current research is an attempt to explore psychological impacts of COVID-19 specifically to find out the existence, intensity and dynamics of COVID-19 fear in non-clinical educated population. Subjects and methods: A cross sectional online study was conducted with non-clinical educated Pakistani citizens. Selfstructured questionnaire comprising close and open ended questions was used for data collection from different cities of Pakistan. N=317 participants (men=121, women=196) were the sample for this study. Demographic information was also sought. The age range of sample was 18 to 50+ years. Most of the participants fall in the category of age group 23-28 of sample. All the participants were educated from Intermediate till PhD but majority of participants had 16 years of education. SPSS 22 was used for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis. Result(s): Results yield significant age wise and profession wise difference in existence of COVID fear. Nine major themes were extracted regarding nature of fear i.e. Corona Fear, Loss, fear of isolation or quarantine, religion related fear, death, consequences of COVID-19, Under developed country, Psychological component of fear and empathy. Those who denied fear were asked the reasons and six major themes were extracted here i.e Religion, Inevitability of death, Precautions, Belief in self, Myths or misinterpretation of disease and Avoidant approach. Conclusion(s): Age and profession significantly influenced fear of COVID-19. Gender-wise exploration of themes yields interesting insights.

0	The new world 2020: A crucial paradigm for meeting fast changing world demands in pakistan after covid-19 outbreak. The waves of COVID-19 has shaken the world and bring about many changes in society. The changed environment or new world 2020 after COVID-19 pandemic demand high quality protection in all arena of life. The most important arena that require significant changes have been divided into four categories. First of all, the high mental health issues and low mental health services in Pakistan are not sufficient to control the mental health problem ratio. There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems. Fourthly the provision of mental health support for children is a key area that needs considerable attention after pandemic or crises. The study has contemporary significance as disasters, crises and communicable disease has been prevalent throughout human history and may attack the world at any time in the future.Copyright © 2020 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

0	Covid-19 associated Guillain-Barre Syndrome: Contrasting tale of four patients from a tertiary care centre in India. Background: Globally, more than 12 million people have been infected with COVID -19 infection till date with more than 500,000 fatalities. Although, Covid-19 commonly presents with marked respiratory symptoms in the form of cough and dyspnoea, a neurotropic presentation has been described of late as well. Objective(s): In this brief communication we report four cases of Covid-19 who presented to our hospital with features suggestive of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Discussion(s): The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-related injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibres. The pathogenesis of GBS secondary to Covid-19 is not well understood. It is hypothesised that viral illnesses related GBS could be due to autoantibodies or direct neurotoxic effects of viruses. Conclusion(s): Nervous system involvement in Covid-19 may have been grossly underestimated. In this era of pandemic, it is very important for the physicians to be aware of association of GBS with Covid-19, as early diagnosis and treatment of this complication could have gratifying results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case series of Guillain-Barre Syndrome associated with Covid-19 to be reported from India.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Cytokine induced modulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in primary human nasal epithelial cells. Viral entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) via the spike protein enables endocytosis into host cells using the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2. The frequent upper respiratory tract symptoms of COVID-19 and the localization of the virus to the nasopharynx, the most common site of swabbing, indicate that the sinonasal mucosa may play an important role in SARS-CoV2 infection and viral replication. This paper investigates the presence of ACE2 Receptor and TMPRESS2 expression in the primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) from Control, CRSsNP, and CRSwNP and maps the expression changes when exposed to Th1, Th2, Th17 associated cytokines. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is higher in control HNECs than CRSwNP HNECs, and that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are downregulated further by Th2 cytokines in CRSwNP HNECs. This indicates an immune dysregulated state of CRSwNP mucosa, which normally contributes to a chronic inflammatory state, might support an altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission.	false
0	Viral Genetic Evidence and Host Immune Response of a Small Cluster of Individuals with Two Episodes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Background: The dynamics underlying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection remains poorly understood. We added to the registered case reports of reinfection in USA, Belgium/Netherlands, Ecuador and Hong Kong, a small cluster of individuals with two episodes of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Virus genomic analysis and the host immune response were used to characterize this group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Four individuals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 on March and again in late May of 2020 were studied. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for RT-PCR and viral genome sequencing (BGI-MGI-2000). Plasma samples from the acute and convalescent phases of both infection episodes were accessed to document innate and humoral responses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: After approximately 60 days of the first diagnostic episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the four individuals presented new clinical and molecular evidence of COVID-19. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence provided genetic evidence of reinfection. The individuals presented an enhanced innate response compared to healthy SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Patients did not develop a neutralizing humoral immunity, possibly remaining susceptible to another episode of COVID-19. The second episode, associated with higher viral loads and clinical symptoms, likely boosted their anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was fully documented by identification of genetically distinct virus sequences in the first and second episodes for two individuals. The quantity of SARS-CoV-2-associated genetic reads and coverage of virus genome ruled out that the initial RT-PCR results were false positive. The identification that some individuals with mild COVID-19 may have controlled SARS-CoV-2 replication without developing detectable humoral immunity, opens the possibility that reinfection may be more frequent than supposed &ndash; but weakly documented. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	false
0	Clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 among adult patients admitted to the isolation centre at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital Bauchi, Northeast Nigeria. Introduction: as the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 infection continue to evolve with increasing prevalence and incidence globally, management of cases in low-resource health care settings require basic detailed clinical and laboratory characteristics. This study retrospectively described the clinical and laboratory characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted into the isolation centre of ATBUTH, Bauchi., Methods: clinical and laboratory data of 84 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted into the isolation centre of ATBUTH, Bauchi according to NCDC guidelines were used. Diagnosis was based on nasal and nasopharyngeal swab positive result of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result. Data extracted includes demographic, clinical presentations and laboratory characteristics., Results: the 84 COVID-19 patients comprised of 72% (59) males and 28% (25) females with mean age of 41.0+/-10.5 years, majority of the patients were within age-group 21-40 years. Forty-one percent presented with mild to moderate symptoms, 3.6% (3) presented with severe symptoms while 58.3% (49) were asymptomatic with mean body temperature of 36.60C +/- Sa. The common clinical manifestations were fever 23.4% (19) and cough 20.7% (17). About 29.3% of the patients had comorbidities, 17.1% (14) were hypertensive while 12.2% of the diabetic. Thirty percent (10) of the patients with DM required intensive care unit (ICU) admission with 10% mortality. Biochemical parameters were within normal range for all the patients. However, haematological parameters showed increased neutrophil (10, 43.5%) and lymphocyte count (19 (59.4%)., Conclusion: the study findings revealed high number of asymptomatic cases, similarity in clinical manifestation and relatively normal laboratory characteristics. More experience with increase in number of patients may provide additional information. Interrupting community transmission will require early detection and contact trace of asymptomatic cases.

0	COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes during the first wave: Are Care Quality Commission ratings a good predictor of at risk homes?. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 placed a significant burden on the care home population during the first wave. Care Quality Commission's care quality ratings are given to all English care homes and could be used to identify whether care homes are at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks., METHODS: An audit was performed, April 2020, of Liverpool care homes to identify associations between COVID-19 status and care quality ratings from the Care Quality Commission. Univariable logistic regression was performed to identify whether the Care Quality Commissions ratings were associated with a care home experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, or a home having asymptomatic cases., FINDINGS: Over half of the care homes (53.2%, n=41), had laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and 39 (95.1%) of these were reported as outbreaks. A small number of care homes (10.4%, n=8) had asymptomatic cases and over a third had no clinical or asymptomatic cases (36.4%, n=28). There was no significant difference between the overall Care Quality Commission rating of Liverpool and English care homes (p=0.57). There was no significant association between any of the Care Quality Commission rating domains and the presence of COVID-19 outbreaks and/or asymptomatic cases., CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Care Quality Commission ratings were not associated with COVID-19 outbreaks or asymptomatic cases in care homes. Infection prevention and control components of Care Quality Commission ratings need to be strengthened to identify care homes at a potential risk of infectious disease outbreaks that may require targeted support. Further large-scale studies will be required to test the findings from this study. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Normal chest CT in 1091 symptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19: frequency, characteristics and outcome. OBJECTIVE: Frequency of normal chest CT in symptomatic COVID-19 patients as well as the outcome of these patients remains unknown. The objectives of this work were to assess the incidence of initially normal chest CT in a cohort of consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms and to compare their clinical characteristics and their outcome to matched patients with typical COVID-19 lesions at initial CT., METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd, all consecutive adult patients referred to the COVID-19 clinic of our Emergency Department were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a normal initial chest CT after second reading was 1:1 matched based on sex, age and date of CT acquisition to a patient with positive RT-PCR and initial chest CT with typical COVID-19 lesions. Clinical data, laboratory results and outcomes (major being mechanical ventilation and/or death) were compared between both groups, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar's chi-squared test and/or exact McNemar's test where appropriate., RESULTS: Fifty-seven chest CT out of 1091 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0-6.7) in symptomatic patients with positive RT-PCR were normal, with a median onset of symptoms of 4.5 days (IQR [1.25-10.25]). After a median follow-up of 43 days, death and/or mechanical ventilation occurred in 3 patients (5.3%) in the study group, versus 11 (19.3%) in the control group (p = 0.011)., CONCLUSIONS: Normal initial chest CT occurred in 5.2% of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases in our cohort. While better than those with abnormal chest CT, outcome was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation., KEY POINTS: * In a cohort of 1091 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, initial chest CT was normal in 5.2% of cases. * Normal chest CT in confirmed COVID-19 is frequent even when onset of symptoms is greater than 3 days. * The outcome of COVID-19 patients with initial normal chest CT, while better than those with abnormal CT, was not entirely benign with 5.3% death and/or mechanical ventilation.	false
0	Clinical validation of a second generation anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM automated chemiluminescent immunoassay. OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven to be extremely contagious and has spread rapidly all over the world. A key aspect in limiting the virus diffusion is to ensure early and accurate diagnosis. Serological assays could be an alternative in increasing testing capabilities, particularly when used as part of an algorithmic approach combined with molecular analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a second generation chemiluminescent automated immunoassay able to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies METHODS: Data are carried out on healthy subjects and other infectious diseases pre-pandemic sera, as controls, and on two different Covid-19 hospitalized patient groups (early and late infection time). Data obtained have been analyzed in terms of precision, linearity, sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: Specificities are: 100% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, in all patient groups. Sensitivities are: 97%, 100% and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 87%, 83% and 86% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the early infection, in the late infection and in the total patient group, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The Mindray anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, indicating that IgG and IgM simultaneous detection is useful even in the early phases of infection.

0	Evaluation of two rapid antigen tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. Successful containment strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will depend on reliable diagnostic assays. Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD TM F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9% (FIA) (n = 189) and 64.5% (RAT) (n = 256). This questions these tests' utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting. Moreover, the efficacy of alternative testing strategies to complement PCR assays must be evaluated by independent laboratories, prior to widespread implementation in national and international test strategies.	false
0	High prevalence of diabetes and other comorbidities in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Delhi, India, and their association with outcomes. Background and aims: To study the prevalence and impact of diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method(s): In a prospective, observational study including consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID-19, clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers were compared in those with and without diabetes. Participants were classified as having mild or severe COVID-19 disease using the WHO ordinal scale. Result(s): 401 patients (125 females) with median age of 54 years (range 19-92) were evaluated. Of them 189 (47.1%) had pre-existing diabetes and21 (5.2%) had new-onset hyperglycaemia. Overall, 344 (85.8%) and 57 (14.2%) cases had mild and severe COVID-19 disease respectively. The group with diabetes had a higher proportion of severe cases (20.1% vs 9%, p-0.002), mortality (6.3 vs 1.4%, p-0.015), ICU admission (24.3 vs 12.3%, p-0.002), and oxygen requirement (53.4 vs 28.3%, p < 0.001). Baseline Hba1c (n = 331) correlated significantly with outcome severity scores (r 0.136, p-0.013) and 12/15 (80%) of those who succumbed had diabetes. Hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease were present in 164 (40.9%), 35 (8.7%) and 12 (2.99%) patients respectively. Hypertension was associated with a higher proportion of severe cases, mortality, ICU admission and oxygen administration. Conclusion(s): We report a high prevalence of diabetes in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Patients with diabetes or hypertension had more severe disease and greater mortality.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India	false
0	Elevated Extracellular Volume Fraction and Reduced Global Longitudinal Strains in Patients Recovered from COVID-19 without Clinical Cardiac Findings. Background It is unknown if there are cardiac abnormalities in participants recovered from COVID-19 without cardiac symptoms and those who have normal biomarkers and normal ECGs. Purpose To evaluate cardiac involvement in participants recovered from COVID-19 without clinical evidence of cardiac involvement using cardiac MRI Materials and methods In this prospective observational cohort study, 40 participants recovered from COVID-19 with moderate(n=24) or severe(n=16) pneumonia and no cardiovascular medical history, without cardiac symptoms, with normal ECG, normal serological cardiac enzyme levels, and discharged > 90 days between May and September 2020. Demographic characteristics, serum cardiac enzymes, and cardiac MRI were obtained. Cardiac function, native T1, ECV and Two-dimensional (2D) strain were quantitatively evaluated and compared with controls (n = 25). The Comparison among the 3 groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni corrected post-hoc comparisons(for normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis tests with post-hoc pairwise comparisons(for non-normal distribution). Results Forty participants (54+/-12 years; 24 men) enrolled with a mean time between admission and CMR of 158 +/-18 days and discharge and CMR examination of 124 +/-17 days. There was no LV and RV size or functional differences among participants recovered from COVID-19 and healthy controls. Only one (3%) participants had positive LGE located at the mid inferior wall. Global ECV values were elevated in both participants recovered from COVID-19 with moderate or severe pneumonia, compared to the healthy controls [median ECV (IQR)], [29.7% (28.0%-32.9%), versus 31.4% (29.3%-34.0%), versus 25.0% (23.7%-26.0%); both p<.001]. The 2D-global LV longitudinal stains (GLS) were reduced in both groups of participants [COVID-19 moderate group,-12.5%(-10.7%--15.5%), COVID-19 severe group, -12.5%(-8.7%--15.4%) compared to healthy control group -15.4%(-14.6%-17.6%), p=.002 and p=.001, respectively]. Conclusion CMR myocardial tissue and strain imaging parameters suggest that a proportion of participants recovered from COVID-19 had subclinical myocardial abnormalities detectable months after recovery.	false
0	Viroinformatics-Based Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Core Proteins for Potential Therapeutic Targets. SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus for which no known effective antiviral drugs are available. In the present study, to accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics-based in silico drug discovery approaches are utilized. We performed multiple sequence alignments of the Spike (S) protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. This provided us with insights into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drugs or specific antibodies. Further, we analyzed the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 core proteins, i.e., S and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), to elucidate how the virus infection can utilize hemoglobin to decrease the blood oxygen level. Moreover, after a comprehensive literature survey, more than 60 antiviral drugs were chosen. The candidate drugs were then ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike and RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The present multidimensional study further advances our understanding of the novel viral molecular targets and potential of computational approaches for therapeutic assessments. The present study can be a steppingstone in the selection of potential drug candidates to be used either as a treatment or as a reference point when designing a new drug/antibody/inhibitory peptide/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Role of Complete Duplex Ultrasound to Diagnose Deep Vein Thrombosis in COVID-19 Critical Patients. An increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been reported in critical COVID-19 patients, despite adequate thromboprophylaxis, and most of DVT are probably asymptomatic. As a screening approach has been advocated, the best examination protocol is unknown. The objective of this study is to assess the role of a Complete Duplex Ultrasound (CDUS) examination in detecting DVT in a large population of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. Single-center retrospective study of 145 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. DVT was assessed with a CDUS performed by experienced radiologist after ICU admission. DVT was confirmed in 38 patients (26%). Most DVT were distal to the knee (66%), while only 16% were proximal. At the time of the examination, 55% of the patients received full-dose anticoagulation, while 45% received thromboprophylaxis, and there were no differences in anticoagulation regimen between positive and negative patients. Patients with DVT had higher dimers compared with those with negative CDUS (P <.002). The observed frequency of DVT is high despite adequate anticoagulation. A comprehensive and experienced ultrasound examination protocol can allow to recognize a large number of distal DVT otherwise missed, albeit their clinical significance is unknown.Copyright © 2021, Society for Vascular Ultrasound.	false
0	Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials. Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and poses a threat to humanity. However, no specific therapy has been established for this disease yet. We conducted a systematic review to highlight therapeutic agents that might be effective in treating COVID-19. Method(s): We searched Medline, Medrxiv.org, and reference lists of relevant publications to identify articles of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 published in English until the last update on October 11, 2020. Result(s): We included 36 studies on SARS, 30 studies on MERS, and 10 meta-analyses on SARS and MERS in this study. Through 12,200 title and 830 full-text screenings for COVID-19, eight in vitro studies, 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 6,886 patients, and 29 meta-analyses were obtained and investigated. There was no therapeutic agent that consistently resulted in positive outcomes across SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Remdesivir showed a therapeutic effect for COVID-19 in two RCTs involving the largest number of total participants (n = 1,461). Other therapies that showed an effect in at least two RCTs for COVID-19 were sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (n = 114), colchicine (n = 140), IFN-beta1b (n = 193), and convalescent plasma therapy (n = 126). Conclusion(s): This review provides information to help establish treatment and research directions for COVID-19 based on currently available evidence. Further RCTs are required.Copyright © The author(s).	false

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, known for its immunomodulatory properties. It has shown antiviral effect specifically against Sars-CoV-2 in vitro, and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> : DAWn-Azithro is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID-wards are eligible for study-inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 hours through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage), or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physician’s discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. Primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. <h4>Discussion: </h4> : The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact on the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN-consortium, will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.

0	Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across racial and ethnic groups. A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT, but more realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in an assortative mixing model fit to Long Island census data, 80% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in a dis-proportionate distribution of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Increased serum amylase and/or lipase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: Is it really pancreatic injury?. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disorder caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although it mainly affects the respiratory system, the pancreas could also become the virus' target. The issue regarding pancreatic involvement in COVID-19 has been raised by several researchers. They found increased serum amylase and/or lipase in COVID-19 patients, which suggested pancreatic injury. We aimed to critically review the evidence to provide insights and to answer the very question of the possibility of pancreatic injury. Current evidence shows that increased amylase and/or lipase is not necessarily a pancreatic injury in COVID-19 patients. Those increased enzymes might also be found in other clinical conditions.	false
0	National interest may require distributing COVID-19 vaccines to other countries. As the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine progress, understanding how to distribute the initially scarce doses is of paramount importance and a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs involved in domestic-only versus cooperative distribution is still missing. In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show under which circumstances it is in a country’s self-interest to ensure other countries can also obtain a COVID-19 vaccine rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the US’s decision and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.	false
0	Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 in 14.8 million individuals in Bahia, Brazil. COVID-19 is affecting healthcare resources worldwide, with lower and middle-income countries being particularly disadvantaged to mitigate the challenges imposed by the disease, including the availability of a sufficient number of infirmary/ICU hospital beds, ventilators, and medical supplies. Here, we use mathematical modelling to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Bahia, a state in northeastern Brazil, considering the influences of asymptomatic/non-detected cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. The impacts of policies on the transmission rate were also examined. Our results underscore the difficulties in maintaining a fully operational health infrastructure amidst the pandemic. Lowering the transmission rate is paramount to this objective, but current local efforts, leading to a 36% decrease, remain insufficient to prevent systemic collapse at peak demand, which could be accomplished using periodic interventions. Non-detected cases contribute to a ~55% increase in R0. Finally, we discuss our results in light of epidemiological data that became available after the initial analyses.	false
0	Dissecting strategies to tune the therapeutic potential of SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coupled with a lack of therapeutics, has paralyzed the globe. Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2021, Atyeo et al.	false
0	Human activity pattern implications for modeling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Background and Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 and rapidly spread into a global pandemic. Designing optimal community responses (social distancing, vaccination) is dependent on the stage of the disease progression, discovery of asymptomatic individuals, changes in virulence of the pathogen, and current levels of herd immunity. Community strategies may have severe and undesirable social and economic side effects. Modeling is the only available scientific approach to develop effective strategies that can minimize these unwanted side effects while retaining the effectiveness of the interventions. Method(s): We extended the agent-based model, SpatioTemporal Human Activity Model (STHAM), for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Result(s): Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population. Conclusion(s): Future work in pandemic simulations should use empirical human activity data for agent-based techniques.Copyright © 2020	false

Kenya had notified a total of 34,057 cases, reported 574 deaths by end of August 2020. The Country's positivity rate had also come down from 13 to 4 percent between June and August 2020. Despite the gains in controlling the first COVID-19 wave from the non-pharmaceutical interventions, most countries would not sustain the economy with prolonged lockdown and restriction of movements. In Kenya, for instance, it resulted in easing some measures on 27th September 2020 in an attempt to reverse the economic strain. By end of October, the effects of these measures were already reversing with a positivity rate of 14 and bed occupancy of 140 percent. The goal of this study was to model the progression of COVID-19 cases in Kenya post reversed curve of the first wave of infections. <h4>Result: </h4> s An SEIR compartmental model was developed to predict the daily cases of COVID-19 post the reversed curve. The model had 8 compartments containing sub-populatoions of: Susceptible, Exposed, Symptomatic Infectious, Asymptomatic Infectious,Hospitalized,Intesive Care Unit, Deaths and Recovered. The model equations were then solved to obtain the number of cases that would be infected on a daily basis beginning March 14th to January 2021. The model results demonstrated that with the abscence of herd immunity in the general human population, relaxation of the mitigation measures will eventually result to resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The wave of infections length of stay will be 4 months upto January 2021 and will be on the rise to the peak for an estimated 45 days. The cumulative number of cases trend depicts the same pattern as that of the daily cases. It is predicted that the trend will be on the rise till January 2021. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Increased vigilance on post reversed COVID-19 curve is indispensable. Continued interventions such as mass and targetted testing, contact tracing and social distancing measures are imperative to ensure that new infections are isolated real time. This will inform new and appropriate interventions amidst the ongoing pandemic"	false
0	Nasopharyngeal and serological anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA responses in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Background</h4> The systemic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients has been extensively studied. However, much less is known about the mucosal responses in the upper airways at the site of initial SARS-CoV-2 replication. Local antibody responses in the nasopharyngeal epithelium, that are likely to determine the course of infection, have not been analysed so far nor their correlation with antibody responses in serum. <h4>Methods</h4> The IgG and IgA antibody responses were analysed in the plasma as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from the first four COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR in France. Two were pauci-symptomatic while two developed severe disease. Taking advantage of a comprehensive series of plasma and nasopharyngeal samples, we characterized their antibody profiles from the second week post symptoms onset, by using an in-house ELISA to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) IgG and IgA. <h4>Results</h4> Anti-N IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the NPS of severe patients. Overall, the levels of IgA and IgG antibodies in plasma and NPS appeared specific to each patient. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Anti-N IgG and IgA antibodies are detected in NPS, and their levels are related to antibody levels in plasma. The two patients with severe disease exhibited different antibody profiles that may reflect different disease outcome. For the pauci-symptomatic patients, one showed a low anti-N IgG and IgA response in the plasma only, while the other one did not exhibit overt serological response.	false
0	Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and mortality: an expanded re-analysis of a recent publication. BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations., METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations., RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94)., CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.	false
0	Inflammation and Vascular Injury as the Basis of COVID-19 Skin Changes: Preliminary Analysis of 23 Patients from the Literature. Background: COVID-19 can affect various organ systems including the skin. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in infected patients are poorly characterized., Objective: To summarize retrospectively the skin features of COVID-19 infection and to analyze the skin rash incidence rate, clinical onset time, cutaneous manifestations, pathological characteristics and relationship with the novel coronavirus pneumonia severity., Methods: The literature up to Sep 20, 2020, were searched and analyzed. Information on clinical features including skin manifestations, disease severity, stage and onset day, and cutaneous pathological characteristics was extracted. Data were analyzed using descriptive non-parametric statistics. For categorical data, the number and percentage of patients are presented. A Spearman correlation test was used to analyze the associations between rash type, rash onset and severity of COVID-19. All statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software (version 20) using two-tailed tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant., Results: Twenty-three cases of COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations from seven reports were collected. Inflammatory dermatosis, skin vasculitis and vascular dermatosis were the main lesion types of COVID-19 patients. Microvascular and endothelial cell injury, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, thrombosis, extremely dilated vessels and prominent deposits of C5b-9 were the main dermatologic pathological changes. The onset day analysis showed that out of 19 patients, 63.2% of cutaneous manifestations were within 10 days, 21.1% in 10-20 days and 15.8% were 20 days after the time the patient presented with COVID-19 main symptoms. Spearman rho analysis found no correlation between skin rash type, onset day and COVID-19 severity., Conclusion: COVID-19 induced skin changes are one of the manifestations of immune responses to the novel coronavirus. Clinical and pathological characteristics were identified as dermal inflammatory reactions and/or skin vascular injury. External or systematic use of anti-inflammatories, protection of blood vessels and circulation-improving medicines should be considered in the skin treatments for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients.

0	Hyperosmolarity Deserves More Attention in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients with Diabetes: A Cohort-Based Study. Purpose: Recently, a cluster of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan and spread throughout the world. More information about risk factors for mortality of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain to be evaluated., Methods: We included adult patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were critically ill and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 20, 2020. Data were collected and compared between patients who died and improved. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for death of SARS-CoV-2-infected critically ill patients., Results: A total of 160 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, of which 146 patients with appeared outcomes were included into the final analysis. The random blood glucose, serum sodium and effective plasma osmolarity were higher in deceased patients, especially in patients with diabetes. There were 7 patients with diabetes with hyperosmolar status and all of them were deceased. Multivariable regression revealed that older age (odds ratio 4.28, 95% CI 1.01-18.20; p = 0.049), higher C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.024), higher interleukin-6 (odds ratio 1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.0323), and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL (odds ratio 1.10, 1.01-1.20; p = 0.032) at admission were associated with increased odds of death., Conclusion: In conclusion, hyperosmolarity needs more attention and may contribute to mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially in those with diabetes. Older age, inflammatory response, and thrombosis may be risk factors for death of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2021 Gou et al.	false
0	A meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of thromboembolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis in patients. Numerous studies have been conducted on COVID-19 and its association with thromboembolism is well known. We conducted a meta-analysis to find out the incidence of thromboembolism in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 to provide more generalized results. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and SCOPUS to find observational studies reporting outcomes of interest. Amongst the studied thromboembolic events, the meta-analysis showed the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PP: 12.4% [7.2%, 18.6%]; 12 = 97.23%) to be the highest. It was followed by deep vein thrombosis (PP: 8.6% [4.2%, 14.3%]; 12 = 97.52%), myocardial infarction (PP: 2.3% [0.2%, 11.2%]; 12 = 99.3%), and stroke (PP: 1.2% [0.8%, 1.6%]; 12 = 65.09%). The results of this analysis further warrant the timely and appropriate use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and identification of risk factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	false

0	Neuropsychological and neurophysiological correlates of fatigue in post-acute patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19: Insights into a challenging symptom. More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue. We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations. COVID-19-associated inflammation might lead to GABAergic impairment, possibly representing the basis of fatigue and explaining apathy and executive deficits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Is Obesity Policy in England Fit for Purpose? Analysis of Government Strategies and Policies, 1992-2020. Policy Points This analysis finds that government obesity policies in England have largely been proposed in a way that does not readily lead to implementation; that governments rarely commission evaluations of previous government strategies or learn from policy failures; that governments have tended to adopt less interventionist policy approaches; and that policies largely make high demands on individual agency, meaning they rely on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences and are thus less likely to be effective or equitable. These findings may help explain why after 30 years of proposed government obesity policies, obesity prevalence and health inequities still have not been successfully reduced. If policymakers address the issues identified in this analysis, population obesity could be tackled more successfully, which has added urgency given the COVID-19 pandemic., CONTEXT: In England, the majority of adults, and more than a quarter of children aged 2 to 15 years live with obesity or excess weight. From 1992 to 2020, even though the government published 14 obesity strategies in England, the prevalence of obesity has not been reduced. We aimed to determine whether such government strategies and policies have been fit for purpose regarding their strategic focus, nature, basis in theory and evidence, and implementation viability., METHOD: We undertook a mixed-methods study, involving a document review and analysis of government strategies either wholly or partially dedicated to tackling obesity in England. We developed a theory-based analytical framework, using content analysis and applied thematic analysis (ATA) to code all policies. Our interpretation drew on quantitative findings and thematic analysis., FINDINGS: We identified and analyzed 14 government strategies published from 1992 to 2020 containing 689 wide-ranging policies. Policies were largely proposed in a way that would be unlikely to lead to implementation; the majority were not interventionist and made high demands on individual agency, meaning that they relied on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences, and are thus less likely to be effective or to reduce health inequalities., CONCLUSIONS: The government obesity strategies' failure to reduce the prevalence of obesity in England for almost 30 years may be due to weaknesses in the policies' design, leading to a lack of effectiveness, but they may also be due to failures of implementation and evaluation. These failures appear to have led to insufficient or no policy learning and governments proposing similar or identical policies repeatedly over many years. Governments should learn from their earlier policy failures. They should prioritize policies that make minimal demands on individuals and have the potential for population-wide reach so as to maximize their potential for equitable impacts. Policies should be proposed in ways that readily lead to implementation and evaluation. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Childhood Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome: An Emerging Disease with Prominent Cardiovascular Involvement-A Scoping Review. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is an emerging disease in children affected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and thought to be an immune-mediated post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2. The disease presentation is similar to Kawasaki disease but has certain distinguishing features. The exact pathogenesis is still not clear but an aberrant immune response, antibody-mediated vascular damage and virus-mediated abnormal type I and III interferon-gamma response are thought to be responsible. Most children who are previously healthy present after 2-4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infections with febrile illness of short duration with prominent gastrointestinal, cardiac and hematologic manifestations, progressing to vasoplegic shock, requiring vasopressor therapy. Cardiovascular involvement is prominently marked by acute myocardial injury/myocarditis and the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Laboratory markers of inflammation are elevated uniformly. Most children require intensive care, and few need invasive ventilation. The treatment mainly consists of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy like intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids. The overall prognosis is good and reported mortality rates are 0-4%. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.	false
0	Duration and key determinants of infectious virus shedding in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Key questions in COVID-19 are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. Here, we report that infectious virus shedding is detected by virus cultures in 23 of the 129 patients (17.8%) hospitalized with COVID-19. The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and drops below 5% after 15.2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-17.2). Multivariate analyses identify viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR] of 14.7 (CI 3.57-58.1; p < 0.001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0.01 (CI 0.003-0.08; p < 0.001) is independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays could be used in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.	false
0	COVID-19 ‘Immunity’ in Dhaka Slums: Do Genes Matter?. After coronavirus spread beyond China, many predicted that the virus would wreak havoc on low-income countries, especially those with overcrowded slums. And yet, nine months after the outbreak, the COVID-19 death toll in several of the world&rsquo;s biggest slums is very low. This paper asks the question: Do Bangladeshi slum dwellers possess some form of immunity to the effects of COVID-19? To shed light on the problem, we undertook two rounds of a survey in three of Dhaka city's largest slums before and after a super spreader event, the Eid-al-Adha festival. The findings suggest very low or negligible COVID-19 fatality among slum households. We propose four explanations of the seeming immunity to coronavirus among Dhaka&rsquo;s slum dwellers.	false
0	ACE2 Expression and its Prognostic Significance in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. <h4>Background: </h4> and objective: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane structural glycoprotein that acts as a key receptor in the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been identified as an oncogene in some tumor types. However, few studies have explored the role of the ACE2 gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between ACE2 and HNSCC and explore early markers and molecular targets for the treatment of HNSCC. <h4>Methods: </h4> Integrative bioinformatics analyses were applied to uncover the potential role of ACE2 in HNSCC development and tumor-associated immunology. <h4>Result: </h4> s: The results showed that ACE2 was highly expressed in HNSCC and significantly correlated with clinical features such as sex. In addition, ACE2 may be a potential prognostic marker for HNSCC, as it was correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The PPI network revealed that STAT1 is the gene most closely related to ACE2 and that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was the most relevant pathway. Moreover, ACE2 expression was closely associated with the immune-infiltrating levels of CD8 + T cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and neutrophils. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The viral entry molecule ACE2 plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and cancer-immune interactions of HNSCC, suggesting that it is a novel molecular target and a new immune checkpoint in the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC.	false
0	Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Covid-19 in Women. Background: While women account for 40-50 % of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no specific data have been reported in this population. Purpose(s): Assess the burden of cardiovascular comorbidities on outcomes in women hospitalized for Covid-19. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective observational multicenter study from February 26 to April 20, 2020 in 24 French hospitals including all adults admitted for Covid-19. Primary composite outcome included transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. Result(s): Among 2878 patients hospitalized for Covid-19, 1212 (42.1 %) were women. Women were significantly older (68.3 +/- 18.0 vs. 65.4 +/- 16.0 years, P < 0.001) but had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. Among women, 276 (22.8 %) experienced the primary outcome, including 161 (13.3 %) transfer to ICU and 115 (9.5 %) deaths without transfer to ICU. The survival free from death or transfer to ICU was higher in women (HR 0.63, 95 %CI 0.53-0.73, P < 0.001), whereas the observed difference in in-hospital deaths did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.18). The proportion of women that experienced the primary outcome were 37.8 % in women with heart failure (n = 112), 30.9 % in women with coronary artery disease (n = 81), 29.1 % in women with diabetes (n = 254), 26.1 % in women with dyslipidemia (n = 315), and 26.0 % in women with hypertension (n = 632). Age (HR 1.05, 5 years increments, 95 %CI 1.01-1.10), body mass index (HR 1.06, 2 units increments, 95 %CI 1.02-1.10), chronic kidney disease (HR 1.57, 95 %CI 1.11-2.22), and heart failure (HR 1.52, 95 %CI 1.04-2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Women hospitalized for Covid-19 were older and had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. While female sex was associated with a lower risk of transfer to ICU or in-hospital death, Covid-19 remains associated with considerable morbi-mortality in women, especially in those with cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Intravenous Immunoglobulins at the Crossroad of Autoimmunity and Viral Infections. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are blood preparations pooled from the plasma of donors that have been first employed as replacement therapy in immunodeficiency. IVIG interact at multiple levels with the different components of the immune system and exert their activity against infections. Passive immunotherapy includes convalescent plasma from subjects who have recovered from infection, hyperimmune globulin formulations with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). IVIG are used for the prevention and treatment of several infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, or in case of a poorly responsive immune system. The evolution of IVIG from a source of passive immunity to a powerful immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agent results in extensive applications in autoimmune diseases. IVIG composition depends on the antibodies of the donor population and the alterations of protein structure due to the processing of plasma. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG has led us to think that they may represent a useful therapeutic tool even in COVID-19. The human origin of IVIG carries specific criticalities including risks of blood products, supply, and elevated costs. IVIG can be useful in critically ill patients, as well as early empirical treatment. To date, the need for further well-designed studies stating protocols and the efficacy/tolerability profile of IVIG and convalescent plasma in selected situations are awaited.	false
0	High-Risk Drinking in Midlife Before Versus During the COVID-19 Crisis: Longitudinal Evidence From the United Kingdom. Introduction: Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions may have influenced alcohol consumption. This study examines changes in high-risk alcohol consumption from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in an established cohort of middle-aged British adults. Method(s): Participants consisted of 3,358 middle-aged adults from the 1970 British Cohort Study who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for detecting hazardous drinkers in primary care settings in 2016-2018 (when aged 46-48 years) and May 2020 (aged 50 years). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in high-risk drinking (scores of >=5), and multinomial regression was used to compare responses with individual test items in 2016-2018 and May 2020. Result(s): Among middle-aged British adults, high-risk drinking increased by 5.2 percentage points from 19.4% to 24.6% (p<0.001) between 2016-2018 and May 2020. The increase in high-risk drinking was not moderated by sex, marital status, educational attainment, the presence of a chronic illness, or the year the baseline survey was completed. The prevalence of drinking >=4 times a week doubled from 12.5% to 26% from before to during the pandemic (p<0.001), and there was also evidence of an increase in the frequency of being unable to stop drinking. Conclusion(s): This study provides evidence linking the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown restrictions to an increase in high-risk drinking patterns and particularly frequent drinking in British adults. Potential long-term changes in drinking habits should be monitored following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 American Journal of Preventive Medicine	false
0	Epidemiological Characteristics of 64 Covid-19 Patients in Errachidia Province (Daraa-Tafilalet region), Morocco: A Retrospective Analysis. BACKGROUND: At the time of writing this paper, no available data for the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of African patients with COVID-19. Herein, we profiled retrospectively the epidemiological characteristics (clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and clinical outcomes) of 64 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Regional Hospital Center (RHC) of Errachidia, in Morocco. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and laboratory Findings of Covid-19 patients in Errachidia Province, Morocco., METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study included all COVID-19 confirmed patients (died or discharged) hospitalized in the Regional Center of Errachidia, Morocco between March 20, 2020 and May 23, 2020. Patients were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcomes of patients were extracted manually from patient's medical records., RESULTS: In a total of 64 patients with COVID-19, 60.9 % of patients were men, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SD 18.62). At the admission, most patients were asymptomatic 38 (59.4%), and 58 (90.6%) were clinically classified as being at benign state. Chronic illnesses were the most comorbidities observed including diabetes with 8 cases (12.5%), hypertension 3 cases (4.7%), and hyperlipidemia 1 patient (1.6%). The main symptoms were cough 15 (23.4%), fever 10 (15.6), diarrhea 8 (12.5%), headache 5 (7.8%), and sore throat 5 (7.8%). Only 7 patients (10.9%) had lung lesions and lymphopenia was present in only 7 patients (11.1%). The median duration of viral shedding was 14.5 days (9-22). Concerning deceased cases, they were elderly subjects aged 69.75 years and they have presented dyspnea, breathing problems, and respiratory distress as specific symptoms. In addition, an increase of the medians of serum AST, CRP, and glucose levels was noticed in this group. During hospitalization, they presented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and they were transferred to intensive care before they died., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that covid-19 infection often appeared in a benign form in the studied population (90.6% in this study). This finding may incriminate the implication of some protective parameters such as genetic, nutritional or other factors in Moroccan population.

0	Precision Mapping of COVID-19 Vulnerable Locales by Epidemiological and Socioeconomic Risk Factors, Developed Using South Korean Data. COVID-19 has severely impacted socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. To support pandemic control strategies, geographically weighted negative binomial regression (GWNBR) mapped COVID-19 risk related to epidemiological and socioeconomic risk factors using South Korean incidence data (January 20, 2020 to July 1, 2020). We constructed COVID-19-specific socioeconomic and epidemiological themes using established social theoretical frameworks and created composite indexes through principal component analysis. The risk of COVID-19 increased with higher area morbidity, risky health behaviours, crowding, and population mobility, and with lower social distancing, healthcare access, and education. Falling COVID-19 risks and spatial shifts over three consecutive time periods reflected effective public health interventions. This study provides a globally replicable methodological framework and precision mapping for COVID-19 and future pandemics.	false
0	Clinical and epidemiological features discriminating confirmed COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients at screening centres in Madagascar. Early and fast detection of COVID-19 patients help limit the transmission and wide spread of the virus in the community and will have impact on mortality by reducing the incidence of infection among vulnerable people. Therefore, community-based screening is critical. We aimed to identify clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological features that could help discriminate confirmed cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. We found that age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p < 0.001), symptoms onset between 3 and 14 days (aOR:1.35, 95%CI:1.09)1.68, p = 0.006), fever or history of fever (aOR:1.75, 95%CI:1.42-2.14, p < 0.001), cough (aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.31-2.04), sore throat (aOR:0.65, 95%CI:0.49-0.85, p = 0.002), ageusia (aOR:2.24, 95%CI:1.42-3.54, p = 0.001), anosmia (aOR:6.04, 95%CI:4.19-8.69, p < 0.001), chest pain (aOR:0.63, 95%CI:0.47-0.85, p = 0.003), myalgia and/or arthralgia (aOR:1.64, 95%CI:1.31-2.04, p < 0.001), household cluster (aOR:1.49, 95%CI:1.17-1.91, p = 0.001) and evidence of confirmed cases in the neighbourhood (aOR:1.92, 95%CI:1.56-2.37, p < 0.001) could help discriminate COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative. A screening score derived from multivariate logistic regression was developed to assess the probability of COVID-19 in patients. We suggest that a patient with a score >=14 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A patient with a score >=30 should be considered at high risk of COVID-19 and should undergo testing but also needs prompt isolation and contact tracing.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Pragmatic, open-label, single-center, randomized, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus in patients with severe pneumonia secondary to COVID-19: the TACROVID trial protocol. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Introduction</h4> Some COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods and analysis</h4> TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature ≤ 37.5°C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate ≤24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours. <h4>Discussion</h4> Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries. <h4>Trial registration number</h4> NCT04341038 / EudraCT: 2020-001445-39	false

0	Quarantining arriving travelers in the era of COVID-19: balancing the risk and benefits a learning experience from Bahrain. The quarantine period imposed to travelers in many countries due to COVID19 is a major obstacle for any traveler. Lifting the quarantine period could lead to significant improvement in people's quality of life and any country's economy. Bahrain have used two quarantine models from arriving passengers. We report data about the incidence of COVID19 on arriving passengers at Bahrain International airport. Infection rates were reported on arrival, during quarantine and after leaving quarantine. Results showed that travelers had low incidence of COVID19 on arriving and during the quarantine period, while becoming at higher risk after leaving quarantine. We concluded that quarantine requirement maybe lifted for arriving travelers. Testing upon arrival with implementation of the public health preventative measures can minimize the risk of transmission.	false
0	"Intermediate-dose anticoagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19: a propensity score-matched analysis. Background: Thrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain., Research Question: How does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate-versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19?, Study Design and Methods: Using data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (""anticoagulation cohort"", N = 1624), or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy (""aspirin cohort"", N = 1956). Propensity score matching utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death., Results: Among propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate-compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308-0.872]). Among propensity-score matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336-0.812])., Interpretation: In this propensity score-matched, observational study of COVID-19, intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin were each associated with a lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death., Summary conflict of interest statements: No conflict of interest exists for any author on this manuscript."	false
0	Nonspecific blood tests as proxies for COVID-19 hospitalization: Are there plausible associations after excluding noisy predictors?. This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.Copyright © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

0	Excess Cerebrovascular Mortality in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The magnitude and drivers of excess cerebrovascular-specific mortality during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are unknown. We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19-related vascular pathology., METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29)., RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later. Twenty-three states and New York City experienced excess cerebrovascular mortality during the pandemic height. A 10% increase in time spent at home was associated with a 4.3% increase in stroke deaths (incidence rate ratio, 1.043 [95% CI, 1.001-1.085]) after adjusting for COVID-19 deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Excess US cerebrovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed and associated with decreases in stroke-related EMS calls nationally and mobility at the state level. Public health measures are needed to identify and counter the reticence to seeking medical care for acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Takotsubo Syndrome and COVID-19: Associations and Implications. Incidence of cardiovascular complications has increased during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, both population-wide and in patients diagnosed with the disease. This increase has presented complications in patient care, leading to increased hospitalizations, adverse outcomes, and medical costs. A condition of interest is takotsubo syndrome, which may be associated with the novel coronavirus. To understand this connection, a narrative review was performed by analyzing primary studies and case reports available. The findings showed increased incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in both the general population and COVID-19 patients. Proposed mechanisms for the linkage include generalized increases in psychological distress, the cytokine storm, increased sympathetic responses in COVID-19 patients, and microvascular dysfunction. Moreover, natural disasters are noted as likely being associated with increases of takotsubo syndrome. As the pandemic continues, treating COVID-19 as a systemic condition is imperative, with the increase in takotsubo syndrome marking a significant impact of the novel coronavirus.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Confronting the threat of SARS-CoV-2: Realities, challenges and therapeutic strategies (Review). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly developed into a global pandemic. The disease has affected not only health care systems and economies worldwide but has also changed the lifestyles and habits of the majority of the world's population. Among the potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapy, the viral spike glycoprotein has been studied most intensely, due to its key role in mediating viral entry into target cells and inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals. In the present manuscript the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection are described and a progress report on the status of SARS-CoV-2 research is provided. A brief review of the clinical symptoms of the condition and current diagnostic methods and treatment plans for SARS-CoV-2 are also presented and the progress of preclinical research into medical intervention against SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.

0	Can Outpatient Plastic Surgery Be Done Safely During a COVID-19 Surge? Results of a July 2020 Los Angeles Survey and Literature Review. BACKGROUND: A moratorium was placed on nonurgent surgery throughout much of the United States in mid-March 2020 due to surging numbers of COVID-19 cases. Several months later, and with new safety precautions in place, elective surgery gradually resumed. However, no data exist on the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): This aim of this survey was to assess the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic by quantifying: (1) the preoperative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2; (2) the risk of postoperative COVID-19; (3) outcomes and precious resource utilization for such cases; and (4) the risks to office staff. METHOD(S): Los Angeles plastic surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) were sent an online survey in July 2020, during a local COVID-19 surge, querying about the number of procedures performed in the 8- to 10-week period since reopening, testing policies, surgical complications, and cases among staff. RESULT(S): In total, 112 surgeons reported 5633 surgeries since resuming elective surgery. Of these, 103 (91.96%) surgeons obtained a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for every patient. The preoperative PCR test was positive in 41/5881 (0.69%). Positive tests within 2 weeks postoperation occurred in 7/5380 (0.13%) of surgical patients, 3/8506 (0.04%) of injection patients, and 6/2519 (0.24%) of energy therapy patients. Nine offices reported at least 1 staff member who developed COVID-19. All cases were mild, with no hospitalizations or deaths. CONCLUSION(S): These data demonstrate that plastic surgery can be performed safely during a COVID-19 surge by ABPS diplomates. This has profound impact for patients, plastic surgeons, and health policy regulators.Copyright © 2020 The Aesthetic Society. Reprints and permission: journals.permissions@oup.com.	false
0	Two decades of experience with Sentinel node staging of axilla - is false negative no longer a worry?. Background: Axillary conservation is the way forward after game changing trials like ACOSOG Z0011, surrogate trials like IBCSG,AMAROS, ALMANAC, on-going POSNOC, and newbie ATNEC have decreased the need to fiddle with the axilla. Current standard is the utilisation of double technique with radioisotope and blue dye to decrease false negative rates for true sentinel node retrieval. Method(s): Literature search on the topic in the last two decades. Result(s): The search yielded 197 publications which were subjected to a meticulous review and to extrapolate suggested guidance. Conclusion(s): Single agent preferably radioisotope is recommended in palpable and good biology tumours. Use of single agent blue dye can be standardised in axillary tail tumours. It is also recommended when isotope mapping is logistically not feasible or during pandemics like COVID 19 where looming infrastructure challenges are prevalent. Dual agent technique should be considered in previously treated breast and axilla, neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, bad tumour biology, high BMI and macromastia groups for true nodal retrieval. Optimal number of nodes taken out should not be more than three (n=3). Lower axillary sampling of not more than 3 nodes is recommended for troubleshooting with any localising agent technique. Triple site injection at peri-tumoural, subcutaneous and sub areolar regions and larger volume of blue dye agent injection of up to 8mls increases the localisation success in the dual technique group for lymphatic mapping. Magnetic tracing can be used as an adjunct to either single agent (RI/BD) technique when there is failure to localise the sentinel node.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Using quality improvement methodology to eliminate harm to GOSH patients through standardised devices and enhanced resources. Background In 2019 GOSH identified variations in urethral catheter insertion and urinary catheter care. Datix highlighted this contributed to 28 potentially avoidable patient safety incidents in the previous 18 months. Lack of standardisation across the Trust was due to factors including; misbelief around female nurses catheterising males, patients having NG tubes inserted and multiple brands Trust-wide. The aim Eliminate harm to ureteral catheterised patients. Methods Supported by the Quality Improvement team, a Steering committee was formed from stakeholders Trust-wide. Reviewing incidents to identify themes and interventions, using the Model for Improvement (QI Tool), three work streams were established. 1. Standardised pathway for catheter care: Developing clinical practice guidelines for Urinary Catheterisation, standardising electronic documentation across the MDTs and introducing an escalation pathway. 2. Standardised trust training package: Quick reference posters, FAQs, Insertion videos and a Resources hub for quick/easy access. Facilitating 'Train the trainer study day' to improve overall nursing/medical knowledge. 3. Standardised devices: Standardised brands and devices then developing a device size reference guide. The Project Plan kept focus on the aim and monitored time-dependant tasks. Measurements; Catheter related incidences, Urology referrals for catheterisation (normal anatomy) and nursing staff knowledge on catheter cares. Results Completed - Workstreams 1&2, with a clear pathway, standardised electronic documentation, Trust-wide training package and a suite of resources. Workstream 3 still in progress, with an agreement to consolidate to two preferred devices Discussion Our success is based on multidisciplinary working, using QI methodology and tools (Driver Diagrams) to identify primary drivers and simultaneously make decisions on how to improve care for catheterised patients. *Covid has impacted results but initial findings support our prediction that access to resources increases knowledge and skill, resulting in an impact on incidents. Conclusion Staff now have all the resources needed to provide excellent care for catheterised patients.	false

COVID-19 pandemic will continue to pose a major public health threat until vaccination-mediated herd immunity is achieved. Most projections predict vaccines will reach a large subset of the population late in 2021 or early 2022. In the meantime, countries are exploring options to remove strict lockdown measures and allow society and the economy to return to normal function. One possibility is to expand on existing COVID-19 testing strategies by including large-scale rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs). Currently, there is significant variability in performance and features of available POCTs, making selection and procurement of an appropriate test for specific use case difficult. In this review, we have used the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently published target product profiles (TPPs) for specific use cases of COVID-19 diagnostic tests to screen for top-performing POCTs on the market. Several POCTs, based on clinical sensitivity/specificity, the limit of detection, and time to results, which meet WHO TPP criteria for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 (acute infection) or indirect diagnosis of past infection (host antibodies), are highlighted here.	false
0	Transfusion reactions associated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy for SARS-CoV-2. Background: Convalescent plasma (CP) for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown preliminary signs of effectiveness in moderate to severely ill patients in reducing mortality. While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to CP is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions. Study Design and Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the US Food and Drug Administration emergency investigational new drug and the Mayo Clinic Expanded Access Protocol to Convalescent Plasma approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed. Result(s): Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and 13 were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile nonhemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), and allergic (1.8%) and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12 to 13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80 to 89 years. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the use of CP as a safe, therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.Copyright © 2020 AABB	false

Targeting dementia prevention, first trials addressing multiple modifiable risk factors showed promising results in at-risk populations. In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score >= 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored >= 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired. The bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses. However, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.	false
0	Optimizing the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 PCR testing for low resource and high demand settings: The development of information-dependent pooling protocol. Aim: To compare different pooling methods in an attempt to improve the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic capacities., Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios., Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times., Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged. Copyright © 2020 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and impacts of traditional Chinese medicine treatment on the convalescents of COVID-19. Objectives: A significant proportion of discharged COVID-19 patients still have some symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the treatment of COVID-19, but whether it is helpful for discharged patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the impacts of TCM treatment on the convalescents of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 372 COVID-19 convalescents from February 21 to May 3 in Shenzhen, China were retrospectively analyzed, 291 of them accepted clinically examined at least once and 191 convalescents accepted TCM. Results: After retrospective analysis of the clinical data of convalescents accepted TCM treatment or not, we found that the white blood cell count, as well as serum interleukin-6 and procalcitonin decreased in TCM group. Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly decreased, while prealbumin and albumin increased in TCM group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet count increased in TCM group. The mechanisms of TCM treatment might be the overall regulations, including balanced immune response, improved hematopoiesis and coagulation systems, enhanced functions of liver and heart, increased nutrient intake and lipid metabolism. Conclusions: This study suggested that TCM treatment would be beneficial for discharged COVID-19 patients. However, long-term medical observation and further study with randomized trial should be done to confirm this result. Besides, the potential molecular mechanisms of TCM treatment should be further revealed. Copyright © The author(s).	false
0	Seizure control, stress, and access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City: The patient perspective. Objective: Our epilepsy population recently experienced the acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Herein, we aimed to determine patient-perceived seizure control during the surge, specific variables associated with worsened seizures, the prevalence of specific barriers to care, and patient-perceived efficacy of epilepsy care delivered via telephone and live video visits during the pandemic. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study of adult epilepsy patients who had a scheduled appointment at a single urban Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (Montefiore Medical Center) between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bronx. Subjects able to answer the questionnaire themselves in English or Spanish were eligible to complete a one-time survey via telephone or secure online platform (REDCap). Result(s): Of 1212 subjects screened, 675 were eligible, and 177 adequately completed the questionnaire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.1% of patients reported no change in seizure control, whereas 17.5% reported that their seizure control had worsened, and 7.3% reported improvement. Subjects who reported worsened seizure control had more frequent seizures at baseline, were more likely to identify stress and headaches/migraines as their typical seizure precipitants, and were significantly more likely to report increased stress related to the pandemic. Subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 did not report worsened seizure control. Nearly 17% of subjects reported poorer epilepsy care, and 9.6% had difficulty obtaining their antiseizure medications; these subjects were significantly more likely to report worse seizure control. Significance: Of the nearly 20% of subjects who reported worsened seizure control during the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and barriers to care appear to have posed the greatest challenge. This unprecedented pandemic exacerbated existing and created new barriers to epilepsy care, which must be addressed.Copyright © 2020 International League Against Epilepsy	false
0	Psychophysical Evaluation of the Olfactory Function: European Multicenter Study on 774 COVID-19 Patients. BACKGROUND: The objective evaluation of the olfactory function of coronavirus disease 2019 patients is difficult because of logistical and operator-safety problems. For this reason, in the literature, the data obtained from psychophysical tests are few and based on small case series., METHODS: A multicenter, cohort study conducted in seven European hospitals between March 22 and August 20, 2020. The Sniffin-Sticks test and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test were used to objectively evaluate the olfactory function., RESULTS: This study included 774 patients, of these 481 (62.1%) presented olfactory dysfunction (OD): 280 were hyposmic and 201 were anosmic. There was a significant difference between self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and psychophysical test results (p = 0.006). Patients with gastroesophageal disorders reported a significantly higher probability of presenting hyposmia (OR 1.86; p = 0.015) and anosmia (OR 2.425; p < 0.001). Fever, chest pain, and phlegm significantly increased the likelihood of having hyposmia but not anosmia or an olfactory disturbance. In contrast, patients with dyspnea, dysphonia, and severe-to-critical COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no anosmia, while these symptoms had no effect on the risk of developing hyposmia or an OD., CONCLUSIONS: Psychophysical assessment represents a significantly more accurate assessment tool for olfactory function than patient self-reported clinical outcomes. Olfactory disturbances appear to be largely independent from the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients. The non-association with rhinitis symptoms and the high prevalence as a presenting symptom make olfactory disturbances an important symptom in the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and common flu.	false
0	Inter-laboratory Agreement of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Serologic Assays in the Expedited College of American Pathologists Proficiency Testing Program. CONTEXT: - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged, currently pandemic virus, and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the inter-laboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited., OBJECTIVE: - To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey., DESIGN: - Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology., RESULTS: - A total of 4,125 qualitative results were received from 1,110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all three samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other two samples., CONCLUSIONS: - These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology.

0	6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study. Background: The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. Method(s): We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. Finding(s): In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57.0 (IQR 47.0-65.0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186.0 (175.0-199.0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3.0 (IQR 2.0-5.0) for severity scale 3, 4.0 (3.0-5.0) for scale 4, and 5.0 (4.0-6.0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1.61 (95% CI 0.80-3.25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4.60 (1.85-11.48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0.88 (0.66-1.17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1.77 (1.05-2.97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0.74 (0.58-0.96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2.69 (1.46-4.96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96.2% vs 58.5%) and median titres (19.0 vs 10.0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at follow-up. Interpretation(s): At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

0	Comparative efficacy of respiratory personal protective equipment against viral respiratory infectious diseases in healthcare workers: a network meta-analysis. Objective: With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the healthcare workers (HCWs) require proper respiratory personal protective equipment (rPPE) against viral respiratory infectious diseases (VRIDs). It is necessary to evaluate which type of mask and manner of wearing is the best suitable rPPE for preventing the VRID. Study design: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively analyze the protective efficacy of various rPPE. Method(s): This network meta-analysis protocol was registered in an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020179489). Electronic databases were searched for cluster randomized control trials (RCTs) of comparing the effectiveness of rPPE and wearing manner in preventing HCWs from VRID. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% credibility interval (CrI). The secondary outcome was the incidence of clinical respiratory illness (CRI) reported as an OR with the associated 95% CrI. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) provided a ranking of each rPPE according to the primary outcome and the secondary outcome as data supplement. Result(s): Six studies encompassing 12,265 HCWs were included. In terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection, the continuous wearing of N95 respirators (network OR, 0.48; 95% CrI: 0.27 to 0.86; SUCRA score, 85.4) showed more effective than the control group. However, in terms of reducing the incidence of CRI, there was no rPPE showing superior protective effectiveness. Conclusion(s): There are significant differences in preventive efficacy among current rPPE. Our result suggests that continuous wearing of N95 respirators on the whole shift can serve as the best preventive rPPE for HCWs from the VRID.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health	false
0	"D-dimer levels and COVID-19 severity: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and pandemic disease discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, with lots of asymptomatic cases and a long incubation period. The researchers suggested that high d-dimer levels could predict disease severity, lung complications, and thromboembolic events before they occur., Materials and Methods: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords ""D-dimer"" and ""coronavirus"" or ""D-dimer"" and ""COVID-19."" We used Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to build forest plots of continuous data and assess differences in serum D-dimer concentrations between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 disease. We evaluated p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant and preferred 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., Result: The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 2.32 mug/mL; 95% CI, 0.72 3.92 mug/mL, p< 0.001). We evaluated severe patients with total D-dimer levels. D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients against total COVID-19 patients (SMD: 2.01 mug/mL; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.77 mug/mL, p= 0.08)., Conclusions: We do not know the D-dimer increment mechanism in severe patients yet, but we think that these findings will be useful in the early diagnosis of severe disease and the first treatment."	false
0	Risk factors and predictors associated with the severity of COVID-19 in China: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression. Since December 2019, the pneumonia cases infected with 2019 novel coronavirus have appeared, posing a critical threat to global health. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to discover the different clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 to find the potential risk factors and predictors of this disease's severity, as well as to serve as a guidance for subsequent epidemic prevention and control work. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and other databases were searched to collect studies on the difference of clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and the funnel plots could be made to evaluate the publication bias. P>0.05 means no statistical significance. Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse. In terms of laboratory indicators, the decreased lymphocyte and platelet count, and the increased levels of white blood cell (WBC), D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were more prevalent in severe patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age, gender, and proportion of severe cases did not significantly impact on the outcomes of any clinical indexes that showed high degree of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, the severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by, radiologic finding, some symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, some laboratory indicators, and smoking history, especially the ex-smokers. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have complications and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc., which were the risk factors for the disease to be severer, but the chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease were not associated the severity of COVID-19 in China.

0	COVID-19 in 823 Transplant patients: A Systematic Scoping Review. Abstract Background: Management of COVID-19 in transplant patients is a big challenge. Data on immunosuppression management, clinical picture, and outcomes are lacking. <h4>Objectives:</h4> To summarize the current literature on COVID-19 in transplant patients especially the data regarding the immunosuppression protocols, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Search strategy: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LitCovid, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of the relevant studies were also searched. The search was last updated on June 3, 2020. Selection Criteria: Primary reports of solid organ transplant patients who developed COVID-19. An overlap of cases in different reports was checked. Data collection and analysis: A descriptive summary of immunosuppression therapy (before and after COVID-19), clinical presentation (symptoms, imaging, laboratory, and disease severity), management (oxygen therapy, antiviral, and antibacterial), major outcomes (Intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury), and mortality. Main results: We identified 74 studies reporting 823 cases of solid organ transplantation with COVID-19. Among 372 patients, 114 (30.6%) were mild COVID-19, 101 (27.2%) moderate, and 157 (42.2%) severe or critical. Major outcomes included intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and acute kidney injury, which occurred in 121 (14.7%), 97 (11.8%), and 63 (7.7%) of patients, respectively. Mortality was reported in 160 (19.4%) patients. Missing individual data hindered making clinical correlations. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> COVID-19 in solid organ transplant patients probably has a more disease severity, worse major outcomes (Intensive care admission, invasive ventilation, acute kidney injury), and higher mortality than in non-transplant patients.	false
0	Is COVID-19 a high risk factor for lung cancer?: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has become a common threat to global human health and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Some asymptomatic patients with early-stage lung cancer who have COVID-19 receive surgical treatment but develop severe pneumonia and other complications or even experience postoperative death, and they may have a worse prognosis compared with healthy individuals infected with COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients and provide evidence-based medical support for clinical treatment., METHODS: We will search 6 medical databases to identify eligible studies published from the establishment of the database to the present. The quality of the included literature will be evaluated using the bias risk assessment tool in Cochrane 5.1.0, and a meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity will be statistically assessed using chi2 tests., RESULTS: The study will integrate existing research findings to investigate the prevalence and severity rate of patients with lung cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with or without COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence to support whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer and provide guidance for clinical prevention and treatment based on the evidence obtained in light of the unpredictable threat posed by COVID-19., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review as it will involve the collection and analysis of secondary data. The results of the review will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals., PRORPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020195967. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

0	"A complementary critical appraisal on systematic reviews regarding the most efficient therapeutic strategies for current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. BACKGROUND: This critical appraisal aims to clarify which systematic reviews on COVID-19 treatment are based on high-value evidence. Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested., METHODS: The Mesh term of ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" [Supplementary Concept] and ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18th , 2020.Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analysis. Cochrane database was searched on November 1st , 2020 by ""COVID"". With adding up 4 articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines., RESULTS: increasing number of clinical trials from onset of COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials., CONCLUSIONS: currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.

0	Diarrhea Is Associated with Increased Severity of Disease in COVID-19: Systemic Review and Metaanalysis. COVID-19 has become a pandemic since its emergence in Wuhan, China. The disease process was initially defined by presence of respiratory symptoms; however, it is now well studied and shown in evidence that this is a multisystem process. Involvement of gastrointestinal (GI) system has been identified, and GI symptoms can be the only presenting symptoms in some patients. Hence, it is important to identify and understand the GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 for appropriate care of patient. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to identify the GI symptoms of COVID-19 and identify association of diarrhea with severity of COVID-19. We performed extensive search of Medline and Embase from December 2019 to May 2020 to identify articles reporting GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was prevalence of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and secondary outcome was the association of diarrhea with disease severity. A total of 38 studies with 8407 patients were included. Of the total patients, 15.47% patients had at least one GI symptom. The pooled prevalence of nausea/vomiting was 7.53% and diarrhea was 11.52%. On metaanalysis, patients with diarrhea as one of the presenting symptoms were more likely to have severe disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.11-3.38, p = 0.01). Our systematic review and metaanalysis demonstrated that GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Presence of diarrhea as a presenting symptom is associated with increased disease severity and likely worse prognosis. Early recognition of patients is needed for prompt management of this at-risk population., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42399-020-00662-w.

0	Development of a novel hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle for rapid in vitro screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral mutations. <h4>SUMMARY</h4> Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are critical to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic 1–6 . Current methods for validation of vaccine efficacy involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), to quantify neutralizing antibodies for blocking viral infection 7–14 . The process of pseudovirus infection and quantification is time consuming and can take days to complete. In addition, pseudoviruses contain structural proteins not native to SARS-CoV-2, which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses to antibody neutralization 15 . Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle, composed of only SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived from a fast expressing alphavirus vector 16 . We demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-5 hours following viral entry. We further validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. In addition, we assembled a Ha-CoV-2 particle bearing the D614G mutant spike protein, and found that the mutation led to an approximately 200% increase in virion infectivity. These results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can also be applied for rapid monitoring and quantification of viral mutations for effects on neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines.	false
0	Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations in acutely ill patients. Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Whether the reported immune alterations are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or also triggered by other acute illnesses remains unclear. We performed flow cytometry analysis on fresh peripheral blood from a consecutive cohort of i) patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; ii) patients of comparable age/sex hospitalized for other acute disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative); and iii) healthy controls. Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1 + mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM + monocytes, and CD38 + CD8 + T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients. Our study lays the foundation for the development of specific biomarkers to stratify SARS-CoV-2 + patients at risk of unfavorable outcome and uncover novel candidate molecules to investigate from a therapeutic perspective.	false
0	Age-dependent pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. The sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy people is not significantly different among age groups, but persons age 65 years or older had strikingly higher COVID-19 mortality compared to younger individuals. To understand COVID-19 manifestations in patients of different ages, ferrets in three age groups were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from all ferrets regardless of age, aged ferrets (≥3 years old) showed higher viral load, longer nasal virus shedding, and more severe lung inflammatory cell infiltration and clinical symptom compared to ≤6 months juvenile and 1-2 years young adult groups. Transcriptome analysis of aged ferret lungs revealed strong enrichment of gene sets related to type I interferon, activated T cell, and M1 macrophage responses, mimicking the gene expression profile of severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged ferrets highly recapitulate COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and are useful for understanding an age-associated infection, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.	false

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD); in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with specific DMARDs; and the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection among hospitalised patients with RA., METHODS: A nationwide cohort study from Denmark between 1 March to 12 August 2020. The adjusted incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA; spondyloarthritis including psoriatic arthritis; connective tissue disease; vasculitides; and non-IRD individuals.Further, the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA treated respectively non-treated with TNF-inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, or glucocorticoids.Lastly, the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection (intensive care, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death) among hospital-admitted patients was estimated for RA and non-IRD individudals., RESULTS: Patients with IRD (n = 58,052) had an increased partially adjusted incidence of hospitalisation with COVID-19 compared with the 4.5 million people in the general population (HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.86) with strongest associations for patients with RA (n = 29,440, HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.29 to 2.30) and vasculitides (n = 4072, HR 1.82, 95%CI 0.91 to 3.64). There was no increased incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation associated with TNF-inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine nor glucocorticoid use. COVID-19 admitted patients with RA had a HR of 1.43 (95% CI 0.80 to 2.53) for a severe outcome., CONCLUSION: Patients with IRD were more likely to be admitted with COVID-19 than the general population, and COVID-19 admitted patients with RA could be at higher risk of a severe outcome. Treatment with specific DMARDs did not affect the risk of hospitalisation. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

0	The ancient cardioprotective mechanisms of ACE2 bestow SARS-CoV-2 with a wide host range. SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated, suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> A conserved mechanism essential for ACE2 catalytic activity is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 binding, allowing the virus to infect a wide range of species.	false
0	Lymphopenia and lung complications in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): A retrospective study based on clinical data. <h4>Background: </h4> A rapid outbreak of novel coronavirus, COVID-19, made it a global pandemic. This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and Computed tomography (CT) scan features and COVID-19 patient mortality. Method: The clinical data of 596 COVID-19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020. The patients’ serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored. <h4>Results:</h4> The median age of the patients was 56.7±16.4 years old. Lung involvement was more than 50% in 214 COVID-19 patients (35.9%). The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 20.35 ±10.16. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may not indicate the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death (odds ratio [OR], 9.24; 95% confidence interval [95 CI%], 4.32- 19.78). These results indicated that lymphopenia <20% along with pulmonary involvement >50% impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital (P= 0.00). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The Lymphocyte count less than 20% and chest CT scan findings with more than 50% involvement might be related to the patient’s mortality. It could act as laboratory and clinical indicators of disease severity and mortality.	false
0	Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020).	false
0	Host genome analysis of structural variations by Optical Genome Mapping provides clinically valuable insights into genes implicated in critical immune, viral infection, and viral replication pathways in patients with severe COVID-19. <h4>Background</h4> The varied clinical manifestations and outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections implicate a role of host-genetics in the predisposition to disease severity. This is supported by evidence that is now emerging, where initial reports identify common risk factors and rare genetic variants associated with high risk for severe/ life-threatening COVID-19. Impressive global efforts have focused on either identifying common genetic factors utilizing short-read sequencing data in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or whole-exome and genome studies to interrogate the human genome at the level of detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels. However, these studies lack the sensitivity to accurately detect several classes of variants, especially large structural variants (SVs) including copy number variants (CNVs), which account for a substantial proportion of variation among individuals. Thus, we investigated the host genomes of individuals with severe/life-threatening COVID-19 at the level of large SVs (500bp-Mb level) to identify events that might provide insight into the inter-individual clinical variability in clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods</h4> Optical genome mapping using Bionano’s Saphyr® system was performed on thirty-seven severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). To extract candidate SVs, three distinct analyses were undertaken. First, an unbiased whole-genome analysis of SVs was performed to identify rare/unique genic SVs in these patients that did not appear in population datasets to determine candidate loci as decisive predisposing factors associated with severe COVID-19. Second, common SVs with a population frequency filter was interrogated for possible association with severe COVID-19 based on literature surveys. Third, genome-wide SV enrichment in severely ill patients versus the general population was investigated by calculating odds ratios to identify top-ranked genes/loci. Candidate SVs were confirmed using qPCR and an independent bioinformatics tool (FaNDOM). <h4>Results</h4> Our patient-centric investigation identified 11 SVs involving 38 genes implicated in three key host-viral interaction pathways: (1) innate immunity and inflammatory response, (2) airway resistance to pathogens, and (3) viral replication, spread, and RNA editing. These included seven rare/unique SVs (not present in the control dataset), identified in 24.3% (9/37) of patients, impacting up to 31 genes, of which STK26 and DPP4 are the most promising candidates. A duplication partially overlapping STK26 was corroborated with data showing upregulation of this gene in severely ill patients. Further, using a population frequency filter of less than 20% in the Bionano control dataset, four SVs involving seven genes were identified in 56.7% (21/37) of patients. <h4>Conclusion</h4> This study is the first to systematically assess and highlight SVs’ potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 severity. The genes implicated here identify novel SVs, especially STK26 , and extend previous reports involving innate immunity and type I interferon response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study also shows that optical genome mapping can be a powerful tool to identify large SVs impacting disease outcomes with split survival and add valuable genomic information to the existing sequencing-based technology databases to understand the inter-individual variability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality.	false
0	Exploring epitope and functional diversity of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies using AI-based methods. <h4>Summary</h4> Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemics, an unprecedented research effort has been conducted to analyze the antibody responses in patients, and many trials based on passive immunotherapy — notably monoclonal antibodies — are ongoing. Twenty-one antibodies have entered clinical trials, 6 having reached phase 2/3, phase 3 or having received emergency authorization. These represent only the tip of the iceberg, since many more antibodies have been discovered and represent opportunities either for diagnosis purposes or as drug candidates. The main problem facing laboratories willing to develop such antibodies is the huge task of analyzing them and choosing the best candidate for exhaustive experimental validation. In this work we show how artificial intelligence-based methods can help in analyzing large sets of antibodies in order to determine in a few hours the best candidates in few hours. The MAbCluster method, which only requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of the antibodies, allows to group the antibodies having the same epitope, considering only their amino acid sequences and their 3D structures (actual or predicted), and to infer some of their functional properties. We then use MAbTope to predict the epitopes for all antibodies for which they are not already known. This allows an exhaustive comparison of the available epitopes, but also gives a synthetic view of the possible combinations. Finally, we show how these results can be used to predict which antibodies might be affected by the different mutations arising in the circulating strains of the virus, such as the N501Y mutation that has started to spread in Great-Britain.	false
0	The assessment of the serum levels of TWEAK and prostaglandin F2 alpha in COVID-19. Background/aim: It is claimed that aberrant immune response has a more important role than the cytopathic effect of the virus in the morbidity and mortality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the possible roles of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEA K)/Fn14 pathway and leukotrienes (LT) in uncontrolled immune response that occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Materials and methods: This study included 25 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum TWEAK, LTE4, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) levels were determined. Results: Compared with the healthy control group, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2 alpha levels were higher in the group of SARS-CoV-2 infection without lung involvement. In the group of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung involvement, age, fibrinogen, sedimentation, C-reactive protein and ferritin, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2 alpha levels were higher, and lymphocyte levels were lower compared with the asymptomatic group. Conclusions: In the study, TWEAK and CITA levels increased in cases with COVID-19. These results support that TWEAK/Fn14 pathway and LT may involved in the pathology of aberrant immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of each of these pathways may be a potential target in the treatment of COVID-19.	false
0	Genetic epidemiology of variants associated with immune escape from global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Many antibody and immune escape variants in SARS-CoV-2 are now documented in literature. The availability of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences enabled us to investigate the occurrence and genetic epidemiology of the variants globally. Our analysis suggests that a number of genetic variants associated with immune escape have emerged in global populations.	false
0	Relationship between the dynamic changes of serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG and patient immunity after 6 month hospital discharge. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between the dynamic changes of serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG and immunity alteration for patients after 6-month hospital discharge., METHODS: One IgM(+) and IgG(-), 32 IgM(+) and IgG(+), 38 IgM(-) and IgG(+), and 40 IgM(-) and IgG(-) patients were included. Demographic data were collected. IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4., RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(-) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(-) and IgG(-) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(-), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4., CONCLUSIONS: The changes of serum IgM and IgG are closely related to immunity in patients in the recovery stage. However, immunity does not recover when the patients test negative for these antibodies.	false
0	Immune targeted therapies for COVID-19 Infection: A Promising Outlook. In December 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) officially declared it a pandemic. Reports indicated that the associated mortality of the infection is quite higher in the elderly, patients with specific comorbidities (like diabetes mellitus), and generally the ones with a compromised immune system. A cohort study of 452 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, reported a dysregulated immune response in these patients. As a result of this suppressed immune response, the increase of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), T lymphopenia, and decrease of CD4+ T cells was considered as common laboratory findings, especially in severe cases. On the other hand, there is also clear evidence of T cell exhaustion in severely ill patients. So, the immune system seems to play an important role in disease prognosis and pathogenesis. This study aims to review the evidence on the immune response dysregulation in COVID-19 infection and the potential role of immunoregulatory treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, interferons, and CD200 inhibitors in altering disease prognosis, especially in critically ill patients.	false
0	Position Statement of IACDE for managing dental patients during COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a major health concern globally ever since it was declared as Pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Due to the evolving and contagious nature of coronavirus, it continues to remain a threat for dental health-care personnel. As the virus travels from person-to-person via direct contact through droplet inhalation, cough, and sneeze or through contact transmission, it remains infectious even through inanimate surfaces. A seemingly healthy asymptomatic person may have the potential to trigger the spread of this disease. Coronavirus has the capability of spreading through community transmission. There is no specific treatment or vaccine as of now for stopping the spread of COVID-19, hence universal precautions and awareness with mass involvement is required to ward off this pandemic. Dental health-care personnel are at immense risk due to the near proximity with patients and continual exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Management protocol regarding awareness and preventive measures should be laid down for dental clinic/hospital to contain the outspread of this infectious disease.

0	Looking for fever in Covid-19 nursing home residents: a false friend?. OBJECTIVES: Residents in nursing homes represent a frail population of patients, and SARS-CoV-2 infection can spread easily in this setting. Despite a frequent severe evolution of the disease, these patients often present an atypical course with mild initial symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of fever in elderly SARS-CoV-2 positive patients residing in nursing homes., METHODS: 231 elderly patients from three nursing homes of Pavia and its Province were enrolled in April-May 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed using real-time RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and/or serological assay (LIAISON R SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG). Positive patients were defined by positivity at nasopharyngeal swab and/or at serology., RESULTS: 170 patients (74%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive, 61 subjects (26%) resulted negative at both tests. Fever (T > 37,5 degreeC) was observed only in four patients (1,7%), three in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (1,7%) and one in the SARS-CoV-2-negative one (1,6%)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever was extremely low in our population of nursing home SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Thus, this finding must be taken into consideration when screening patients without fever in nursing homes. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Mask-associated 'de novo' headache in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed care activities of health professionals. We analysed the possible association between the appearance of 'de novo' headache according to the type of mask used, the related factors and the impact of the cephalalgia on health professionals., METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We provided an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting., RESULTS: The subjects are n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23-65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filter masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented 'de novo' headache. The occurrence of a headache was independently associated with the use of a filter mask, OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.07 to 4.32); being a nurse, OR 2.09 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.72) or another health worker, OR 6.94 (95% CI 3.01 to 16.04); or having a history of asthma, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.89). According to the type of mask used, there were differences in headache intensity, and the impact of a headache in the subjects who used a filter mask was worse in all the aspects evaluated., CONCLUSION: The appearance of 'de novo' headache is associated with the use of filter masks and is more frequent in certain healthcare workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.

0	Factors associated with worsening oxygenation in patient with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Background: This study aimed to determine parameters for worsening oxygenation in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia., Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as those with SpO2 <= 94%, or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening group who were without any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest CT were calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist., Results: We included 136 patients with 32 (23.5%) in the worsening oxygenation group, of whom two needed MV and one died. Initial vital signs and duration of symptoms showed no difference between the two groups, however, univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a variety of parameters at admission were associated with an increased risk of a desaturation event. A subset of patients were studied to eliminate potential bias, that ferritin >= 280 mug/L (p=0.029), LDH >= 240 U/L (p=0.029), pneumonia volume (p=0.021), and extent (p=0.030) by AI, and visual severity scores (p=0.042) were the predictive parameters for worsening oxygenation in a sex-, age-, and comorbid illness-matched case-control study using propensity score (n=52)., Conclusion: Our study presents initial CT evaluated by AI or visual severity scoring as well as serum markers of inflammation at admission are significantly associated with worsening oxygenation in this COVID-19 pneumonia cohort.	false
0	Implementation and evaluation of a COVID-19 rapid follow-up service for patients discharged from the emergency department. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid adaptation of healthcare providers to new clinical and logistical challenges. Following identification of high levels of emergency department (ED) reattendance among patients with suspected COVID-19 at our centre, we piloted a rapid remote follow-up service for this patient group. We present our service framework and evaluation of our pilot cohort of 192 patients. We followed up patients by telephone within 36 hours of their ED attendance. Pulse oximetry was used for remote monitoring of a subset of patients. Patients required between one and six consecutive telephone assessments, dependent on illness severity, and 23 patients were recalled for in-person assessment. Approximately half of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 required onward referral for respiratory follow-up. This framework reduced unplanned ED reattendances in comparison with a retrospective comparator cohort (4.7% from 22.6%). We reproduced these findings in a validation cohort with a high prevalence of acute COVID-19, managed through the clinic in September-October 2020, where we identified an unplanned ED reattendance rate of 5.2%. We propose that rapid remote follow-up is a mechanism by which ambulatory patients can be clinically supported during the acute phase of illness, with benefits both to patient care and to health service resilience.

0	Cytokine release syndrome: inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a solution for reducing COVID-19 mortality. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) reached pandemic proportions at the beginning of 2020 and continues to be a worldwide concern. End organ damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the leading causes of death in severely or critically ill patients. The elevated cytokine levels in severe patients in comparison with mildly affected patients suggest that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in the severe form of the disease. In this paper, the significant role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and their mechanism of action in the CRS cascade is explained. Potential therapeutic approaches involving anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to fight COVID-19 and reduce mortality rate in severe cases are also discussed.	false
0	Canakinumab as treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonia: a prospective case-control study. OBJECTIVES: Canakinumab is an IL-1beta antibody that neutralizes the activity of IL-1beta. We studied the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia., DESIGN: The aim of our study was to evaluate the reduction in duration of hospitalization with adequate oxygen status. Forty-eight patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia were asked to participate in the prospective case-control study; 33 patients (Cases) signed informed consent and received canakinumab (Cohort 1); 15 patients (Controls) refused to receive the experimental drug and received institutional standard of care (SoC), (Cohort 2)., RESULTS: Hospital discharge within 21 days was seen in 63% of patients in Cohort 1 vs. 0% in Cohort 2 (median 14 vs 26 days, respectively; p < 0.001). There was significant clinical improvement in ventilation regimes following administration of canakinumab compared to Cohort 2 (Stuart-Maxwell test for paired data, p < 0.001). Patients treated with canakinumab experienced a significant increase in PaO2:FiO2 (p < 0.001) and reduction in lung damage by CT (p = 0.01), along with significant decreases in immune/inflammation markers that were not observed in Cohort 2. Only mild side effects were seen in patients treated with canakinumab; survival at 60 days was 90.0% (95% CI: 71.9-96.7) in patients treated with canakinumab and 73.3% (95% CI: 43.6-89.1) for Cohort 2., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia rapidly restored normal oxygen status, decreased the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and was associated with earlier hospital discharge and favorable prognosis versus SoC.

0	Protein corona components of polyethylene glycol-conjugated organosilica nanoparticles modulates macrophage uptake. Fluorescent organosilica nanoparticles (FNP) conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) of variant molecular weight (2 K, 12 K, 20 K, and 30 K) were prepared to investigate their cellular uptake by murine-derived macrophages. In a medium with FBS, the cellular uptake of FNP-PEGs was decreased as compared to a medium without FBS, indicating that protein corona on FNP-PEGs reduced cellular uptake. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hemoglobin (Hb) were detected as the most abundant components on all FNP-PEGs. Pre-coating of FNP-PEGs with BSA and Hb reduced the macrophage uptake in a medium without FBS, suggesting that these components might strengthen the stealth function of PEGs. Furthermore, there was more reduction in uptake of BSA- and Hb-coated FNP-PEGs from a medium with FBS than without FBS. BSA and Hb could be the stealth enhancement protein of FNP-PEGs in vitro.

0	European context of the diversity and phylogenetic position of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Polish COVID-19 patients. To provide a comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity in Poland in the European context. All publicly available (n = 115; GISAID database) whole-genome SARS-Cov-2 sequences from Polish samples, including those obtained during coronavirus testing performed in our COVID-19 Lab, were examined. Multiple sequence alignment of Polish isolates, phylogenetic analysis (ML tree), and multidimensional scaling (based on the pairwise DNA distances) were complemented by the comparison of the coronavirus clades frequency and diversity in the subset of over 5000 European GISAID sequences. Approximately seventy-seven percent of isolates in the European dataset carried frequent and ubiquitously found haplotypes; the remaining haplotype diversity was population-specific and resulted from population-specific mutations, homoplasies, and recombinations. Coronavirus strains circulating in Poland represented the variability found in other European countries. The prevalence of clades circulating in Poland was shifted in favor of GR, both in terms of the diversity (number of distinct haplotypes) and the frequency (number of isolates) of the clade. Polish-specific haplotypes were rare and could be explained by changes affecting common European strains. The analysis of the whole viral genomes allowed detection of several tight clusters of isolates, presumably reflecting local outbreaks. New mutations, homoplasies, and, to a smaller extent, recombinations increase SARS-CoV-2 haplotype diversity, but the majority of these variants do not increase in frequency and remains rare and population-specific. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in the Polish dataset reflects many independent transfers from a variety of sources, followed by many local outbreaks. The prevalence of the sequences belonging to the GR clade among Polish isolates is consistent with the European trend of the GR clade frequency increase.	false
0	Prevalence, incidence and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult coeliac patients. OBJECTIVES: Data on SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in adult coeliac disease (CD) are lacking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 in adult coeliac patients regularly followed-up at our centre since January 2015., METHODS: Data about general health status and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively collected over the phone. Data about CD were retrospectively collected from clinical notes. Prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 were compared between the coeliac cohort and the figures in the general population of Lombardy, Northern Italy between 20 February to 5 June 2020 provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita) and the Lombardy regional government., RESULTS: Nine out of 324 patients contracted COVID-19, thus resulting in a prevalence of 2.78% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-4.58] and an incidence rate of 8.15/1000 person-month (95% CI 4.24-15.66). Prevalence of COVID-19 ascertained by means of nasal swab was 1.79% (95% CI 0.22-3.35) and the incidence rate 5.26/1000 person-month (95% CI 2.19-12.63), without difference from the general population. Clinical type of CD, age, sex, duration and adherence to a gluten-free diet, and mucosal healing did not differ between coeliac patients with and without COVID-19. None of the 9 patients with COVID-19 required hospitalization., CONCLUSION: Patients with CD do not seem to carry an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to the general population and their disease course is mild.

0	The Importance and Challenges of Identifying SARS-CoV-2 Reinfections. Reports of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have raised important questions about the strength and durability of the immune response to primary infection, which are key factors in predicting the course of the pandemic. Identifying reinfection requires detecting the virus at two different time points and using viral genomic data to distinguish reinfection from persistent viral carriage. This process is hindered by challenges of logistics and capacity, such as banking samples from primary infection and performing viral genome sequencing. These challenges may help to explain why very few cases have been described to date. In addition, reinfection may be a rare phenomenon, but detailed prospective studies are needed to rigorously assess its frequency. To provide context for future investigations of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we review 16 cases that have been published to date or are available in pre-print. Reinfection occurred across demographic spectra and in patients whose initial infections were both asymptomatic/mild and moderate/severe. For cases in which severity could be compared between episodes, half of reinfections were less severe, raising the possibility of partial immune protection. Although many patients had a positive total immunoglobulin or IgG result at the time of reinfection, very little examination of their immune response was performed. Further work is needed to elucidate the frequency, determinants, and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Establishing the necessary frameworks for surveillance and investigation will rely heavily on clinical laboratories and clinical investigators, and we propose several considerations to guide the medical community in identifying and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections.

0	Correlation between CSF biomarkers and COVID-19 meningoencephalitis: A case series. Background: Recent studies have focused on the incidence rate and pattern of meningoencephalitis in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., Aim: This study aims to shed more light on the CSF pattern and clinical characteristics of meningoencephalitis COVID-19 patients in Zanjan, Iran., Methods: Nine cases of laboratory and imaging confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to Valiasr Hospitals in Zanjan, Iran. Data were collected from 20 May 2020 to 20 June 2020., Results: All the nine patients had positive RT-PCR COVID-19 and Pulmonary involvement who underwent Lumbar puncture and analysis, but despite neurological symptoms, the RT-PCR of CSF for COVID-19 was negative., Conclusion: Although we did not have any cases of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 in lumbar puncture specimens, the justification of neurological symptoms in patients can be the transient presence of the virus in the CSF, and inflammation or autoimmune response caused by the virus, so more studies are needed to determine the cause of neurogenic symptoms.

0	Insomnia is associated with worry, cognitive avoidance and low academic engagement in Argentinian university students during the COVID-19 social isolation. An increment in mental health problems related to social isolation strategies was evinced in several populations, however few investigations address this problem in students. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between insomnia, worry, coping strategies, and academic engagement in subjects pursuing a university degree in Argentina during the first month of compulsory social isolation against the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-report online questionnaires were administered to 584 participants: Insomnia Severity Index, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Coping Responses Inventory, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students. Demographic data was recorded. Statistics included bivariate and multivariate techniques. Prevalences of 45% for subthreshold insomnia, 23% for moderate insomnia, and 4% for severe insomnia were found. The severe insomnia group presented higher levels of worry and cognitive avoidance strategies. Insomnia was also associated with daytime concerns. The group without insomnia was more vigorous in their academic engagement. Being physically active was associated with lower sleep problems. Insomnia prevalence is high in socially isolated university students. Cognitive avoidance coping strategies are associated with worry, which leads to an alert state that makes sleep difficult. These findings should be taken into account by academic institutions to define their pedagogic strategies.	false

Of all the nutrients, vitamin A has been the most extensively evaluated for its impact on immunity. There are three main forms of vitamin A, retinol, retinal and retinoic acid (RA) with the latter being most biologically active and all-trans-RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune-homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon-based innate immune response to RNA viruses decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.During the Covid-19 pandemic interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulator drugs have been tried but most of them are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. The current review explores the possibility of mega dose vitamin A as an affordable adjunct therapy for Covid-19 illness with minimal reversible side effects. Insight is provided into the effect of vitamin A on ACE-2 expression in the respiratory tract and its association with the prognosis of Covid-19 patients. Vitamin A supplementation may aid the generation of protective immune response to Covid-19 vaccines. An overview of the dosage and safety profile of vitamin A is presented along with recommended doses for prophylactic/therapeutic use in randomised controlled trials in Covid-19 patients.

0	Impact of obesity on COVID-19 patients. With the increasing prevalence of obesity, there is a growing awareness of its impact on infectious diseases. In past epidemics of influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, obesity has been identified as a risk factor influencing the severity of illness in infected persons. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a large number of deaths and health damages worldwide. Increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 disease and death. This review focuses on the impact of obesity on patients with COVID-19. We comprehensively analyzed the various mechanisms of obesity affecting the severity of the disease. In addition, on the basis of the vulnerability of people with obesity during the COVID-19 epidemic, we summarized both individual-level and hospital-level prevention and management measures for COVID-19 patients with obesity and discussed the impact of isolation on people with obesity.

0	Early Immune Pathology and Persistent Dysregulation Characterise Severe COVID-19. In a study of 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of severities followed over 12 weeks from symptom onset, we demonstrate that an early robust immune response, without systemic inflammation, is characteristic of asymptomatic or mild disease. Those presenting to hospital had delayed adaptive responses and systemic inflammation already evident at around symptom onset. Such early evidence of inflammation suggests immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals, or that preventative intervention might be needed before symptom onset. Viral load does not correlate with the development of this pathological response, but does with its subsequent severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities correlating with a change in the nature of the inflammatory response, where signatures characteristic of increased oxidative phosphorylation and reactive-oxygen species-associated inflammation replace those driven by TNF and IL-6. These late immunometabolic inflammatory changes and unresolved immune cell defects, if persistent, may contribute to “long COVID”.<br><br>Funding: We are grateful for the generous support of CVC Capital Partners, the Evelyn Trust (20/75), UKRI COVID Immunology Consortium, Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust (12/20A) and the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre for their financial support.

0	[Strategy for planning and execution of a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study on teaching hospital workers during a pandemic situation]. OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning and execution process of a massive seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV-2 in professionals of the Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon (HUFA) (Spain)., METHODS: A description is presented of the plan designed and developed at the HUFA for the execution of the extraction of the samples for serology from all the professionals who worked in the hospital between 14 and 29 April 2020. A descriptive analysis of the participation of the professionals in the study is carried out. Extraction areas, health personnel, and execution times were planned. A total of 2326 extractions were assigned to health personnel, the remaining extractions were assigned to workers from external companies., RESULTS: A total of 2641 workers (90.5%) out of 2918 candidates participated in the study. The professional category most analysed was nursing with 28.3% (n = 590). The percentage of compliance with schedule planning was 28.6%. Up to a maximum of 298 daily extractions were planned. The busiest day was the 4th day of the study with 399 extractions., CONCLUSIONS: The organising of such a large study, with a 100% coverage of those who worked in the hospital, and with such a great response from the workers involved, has led to obtaining results of high reliability in the seroprevalence study carried out. Although the percentage of participation was very high, the level of compliance with the planning was low. Copyright © 2020 FECA. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.	false
0	Hydrating the Respiratory Tract: An Alternative Explanation Why Masks Lower Severity of COVID-19 Disease. Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. <h4>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h4> Facemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks. This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now well-established link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.	false
0	Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms in the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China. The impact of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health was of widespread concern recently. The present study aimed to exam sleep quality and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and potential influence factors in the first phases of COVID-19 massive outbreak in China. A snowball sampling technique was used and a total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Demographic information, epidemic area contact history, sleep quality and PTSS data were collected with an internet-based cross-sectional survey. Results suggested that 59.7% participants were not fully satisfied with their sleep quality, and 50.9% participants had various degrees of short sleep duration problems. 44.1% and 33.0% participants had sleep disturbance and sleep onset latency problems. Also, the prevalence of PTSS reached 4.7% in the self-rating survey. Epidemic area contact history affected PTSS and latency onset of sleep under the influence of COVID-19. Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality had interaction effects on PTSS. The present study was one of the first to evaluate acute psychological responses and possible risk factors during the peak of COVID-19 in China and results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with pandemic exposure experiences is a way to prevent PTSS.	false
0	Investigating the Accuracy of US Citizens' Beliefs About the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study With Educational Intervention. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 'infodemic', a surge of information and misinformation, has sparked worry about the public's perception of the coronavirus pandemic. Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information, as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was twofold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: the United States (US). Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve people's belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic., METHODS: We conducted a four-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the US had peaked. Each week, we measured participants' belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements (2 false, 2 true). Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus., RESULTS: A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced on age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline wave. Retention rate for the follow-up waves was high (minimum 85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high at all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements (scale of -1 to 1, with -1 indicating completely inaccurate beliefs and 1 indicating completely accurate beliefs; mean T0=0.75, mean T1=0.78, mean T2=0.77, mean T3=0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (e.g., social distancing; r at all waves between 0.26 and 0.29, all Ps<.001), and were associated with trust in scientists (higher trust associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (liberal/Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative/Republican participants) and the primary news source (participants reporting CNN or Fox News as main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy., CONCLUSIONS: The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens' beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the public's susceptibility to misinformation., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey ( N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine ( n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.	false
0	Synergistic interferon alpha-based drug combinations inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in vitro. Antiviral drugs are powerful tools to combat emerging viral diseases, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. However, most existing antivirals have failed to cure COVID-19. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics with powerful antiviral and tolerable side effects. Here, we observed that recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFNa) triggered cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral responses and reduced replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. However, IFNa alone was insufficient to completely abolish SARS-CoV-2 replication. The combinations of IFNa with camostat, remdesivir, EIDD-2801, cycloheximide or convalescent serum showed strong synergy and, therefore, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity of IFNa2a with pimodivir against influenza A virus (FluAV) infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells, as well as IFNa2a with lamivudine against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in human TZM-bl cells. Our results indicate that IFNa2a-based combinational therapies help to reduce drug dose and improve efficacy in comparison with monotherapies, making them attractive targets for further pre-clinical and clinical development. Additionally, they have powerful treatment potential, and can be leveraged for use in the inhibition of not only emerging or re-emerging viruses, but also immune-evading or drug-resistant viral variants, and viral co-infections.	false
0	Serology in COVID-19 – Comparison of Two Methods. The aim of our study was to investigate the difference in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment with two various assays. 127 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two serological tests were used: SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA on the Alinity system (ABBOTT) and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA (DiaSorin). Both assays exhibited 96.85% (123/127 patients) overall compatibility. In 2 cases the positive results in N-based test, were negative in S-based test, and in 2 cases negative results in S-based test were positive in N-based test. Based on the results of our study we concluded that the assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against N and S protein in population medicine shows comparable usefulness of both tests.	false
0	Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the influence of confinement by COVID-19 in fracture patients entered in a traumatology service at a third level hospital. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the confinement of approximately one third of the world population, causing a drastic change in the activities of daily life with many repercussions at the health, economic and social levels., OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population., METHODS: Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital. On the other hand, osteoporotic hip fractures have not varied in their incidence and a decrease in the average postoperative and overall stay has been observed. Copyright © 2020 SECOT.

0	Hospital Presentations of Acute Diverticulitis During COVID-19 Pandemic may be More Likely to Require Surgery due to Increased Severity: A Single-Centre Experience. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in fewer emergency presentations of many acute medical and surgical conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of disease at presentation and quantify the change in number of presentations during this period., METHODS: This retrospective study includes all patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis on abdominopelvic computerised tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Follow up scans on the index admission were excluded. Hinchey grade was assessed for all CT scans. Inflammatory markers were analysed, along with outcome measures including length of stay and mortality., RESULTS: Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed in 52 CT scans in the acute pandemic period - a decrease of 51.4%. Average age at presentation was unchanged (63.3 +/- 14.3 vs. 62.8 +/- 13.8, P = .848). The number of Hinchey II, III and IV presentations were significantly higher in the acute pandemic period (28.8% vs. 11.2%, P = .005) and significantly more emergency operations were carried out (7.69% vs. .93%, P = .04). Mortality was not significantly increased, nor were serum levels of C-reactive protein, white cell count and lactate., DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer patients presented and were diagnosed with acute diverticulitis. A significantly greater proportion presented at a more advanced stage and required emergency surgery, suggesting late presentation. Our findings support the need for maintaining acute surgical services and the provision of early radiological and surgical input in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of acute diverticulitis in future pandemics.	false
0	Severe acute kidney injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent in Coronavirus Infection Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Factors associated with AKI in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and their outcomes have not been previously explored., METHODS: Prospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain), from March 25th to April 21st, 2020, who developed AKI stage 2 or higher (AKIN classification). The primary goal was to describe the characteristics of moderate-severe AKI of COVID-19 patients in an ICU context. As a secondary goal, we aimed to find independent predictors of AKI progression, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) requirement and mortality among these patients., RESULTS: During the study period, 52 out of 237 ICU patients, developed AKIN stage 2 or higher and were included in the study. A Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at AKI diagnosis of 8 or higher was associated with RRT, OR 5.2, p 0.032. At the time of AKI diagnosis, patients had a worse liver profile and higher inflammation markers than at admission. Fifty per cent of the patients presented AKI progression from AKIN 2 to 3 and 28.85% required RRT. The use of corticosteroids in 69.2% of patients was associated with a reduced requirement of RRT, OR 0.13 (CI 95% 0.02-0.89), p 0.037. AKI was associated with high mortality (50%) and a longer hospital stay, median 35 vs 18 days (p 0.024)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of moderate/severe AKI in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU is high and has a strong correlation with mortality and length of hospital stay.	false
0	Establishment of a well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay using 293T cells with stable expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Pseudoviruses are useful surrogates for highly pathogenic viruses because of their safety, genetic stability, and scalability for screening assays. Many different pseudovirus platforms exist, each with different advantages and limitations. Here we report our efforts to optimize and characterize an HIV-based lentiviral pseudovirus assay for screening neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 using a stable 293T cell line expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We assessed different target cells, established conditions that generate readouts over at least a two-log range, and confirmed consistent neutralization titers over a range of pseudovirus input. Using reference sera and plasma panels, we evaluated assay precision and showed that our neutralization titers correlate well with results reported in other assays. Overall, our lentiviral assay is relatively simple, scalable, and suitable for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 entry and neutralization screening assays.	false
0	Experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection of bank voles - general susceptibility but lack of direct transmission. After experimental inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 infection was proven for bank voles by seroconversion within eight days and detection of viral RNA in nasal tissue for up to 21 days. However, transmission to contact animals was not detected. Therefore, bank voles are unlikely to establish effective SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycles in nature. <h4>Article Summary Line</h4> Bank voles show low-level viral replication and seroconversion upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, but lack transmission to contact animals.	false
0	Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence and severity of COVID-19 differ between sexes. To explain these differences, we analyzed clinical features and laboratory values in male and female COVID-19 patients. This study included a cohort of 111 people, i.e., 36 COVID-19 patients, 54 sex- and age-matched common viral community-acquired pneumonia patients, and 21 healthy controls. Monocyte counts, lymphocyte subset counts, and alanine aminotransferase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the peripheral blood were analyzed. Higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, monocyte counts, and CRP and ALT levels were found in male COVID-19 patients. Decreased lymphocyte subset counts and proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients, except for the CD3+ and CD8+ T cell proportions. The lower CD4+ T cell proportions and higher CD8+ T cell proportions were observed in male and severe COVID-19 patients and the differences were independently of estrogen level. The CD4+ T cell proportion was negatively associated with the CD8+ T cell proportion in male COVID-19 patients; this correlation was non-significant in females. Our work demonstrates differences between sexes in circulating monocyte counts and CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell proportions in COVID-19 patients, independently of estrogen levels, are associated with the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients with high specificity.

0	Safety of current immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer. Introduction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) achieved response rates around 20% in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 8% of patients becoming long-term survivors. Outcomes have improved with the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy or the combination of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Areas covered. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs varied across clinical trials and real-life studies. The onset of irAEs was 10 weeks. Toxic deaths from irAEs following anti-PD(L)1 administration resulted mainly from pneumonitis. Some irAEs such as rash and thyroiditis were probably associated with better clinical outcomes, though confounding biases exist. Investigations are on-going to determine ideal biomarkers to predict the occurrence, to screen for and to diagnose irAEs. Expert opinion. Prevention, anticipation, detection, treatment and careful monitoring are the five principles that characterize our management of irAEs. Distinguishing immune-induced pneumonitis from progression, pseudo progression, hyper progression or other etiologies (COVID-19) can be particularly challenging in lung cancer due to the baseline vulnerable pulmonary function and thus requires caution and teamwork. We treat patients according to institutional and international guidelines and we only rechallenge them with ICIs after resolution of the AE and corticosteroid tapering.	false
0	The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on the Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19; a Retrospective Cohort Study. There have been limited data assessing the influence of disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) on the incidence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients within the diverse communities of the United States. Here, we aim to investigate the association between poverty level, as an indicator of SES, and COVID-19 related clinical outcomes including hospitalization and all-cause mortality. This retrospective cohort study included 3528 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 seen at a large New York City health system between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Data for neighborhood level poverty was acquired from the American Community Survey 2014-2018 and defined as the percent of residents in each ZIP code whose household income was below the federal poverty threshold (FPT): 0% to < 20% below FPT (low poverty) and > 20% below FPT (high poverty). COVID-19 positive patients who resided in high poverty areas were significantly younger, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities and were more likely to be of female gender or a racial minority when compared to individuals living in low poverty areas. Residence in a high poverty area was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization and was found to be associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality. This study suggests the existence of an unequal socioeconomic gradient in the demographic and clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients including differences in age, gender and race between poverty groups. Further studies are needed to fully assess the intersectionality of SES with the COVID-19 pandemic.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, associated zoonotic concerns, and importance of the One Health approach during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has now affected over 72.5 million people worldwide, with nearly 1.6 million deaths reported globally as of December 17, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to have originated from bats and pangolins, and its intermediate animal hosts are being investigated. Crossing of the species barrier and exhibition of zoonosis have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 in farm (minks), domesticated (cats and dogs), and wild animals (tigers, puma, and lions). Recently, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in mink farms, which led to the death of a myriad minks. The clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rapid animal-to-animal transmission in minks are almost similar to the findings observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid virus transmission among minks and the associated mutations resulted in a new mink-associated variant that was identified in both minks and humans, thereby providing evidence of mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The new mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a possible reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies poses serious risks and is expected to have a direct effect on the diagnostic techniques, therapeutics, and vaccines that are currently under development. This article highlights the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, and provides an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in minks and the associated zoonotic concerns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from minks to humans with an emphasis on appropriate mitigation measures and on the necessity of adopting the One Health approach during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Favorable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with pituitary insufficiency. BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originated in Wuhan (China) rapidly turned into a pandemic. Due to a national compulsive decree of quarantine, office visits for chronic disease control were delay. Hypopituitarism includes all clinical conditions that result in partial or complete failure of the pituitary gland's ability to secrete hormones. Pituitary insufficiency per se has been associated with an increase in both morbidity and mortality, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity., OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with hypopituitarism, discuss the implications of the treatments the patient was taking and grade up the value of telemedicine in the present scenario., METHODS: Report of the clinical record of a patient with hypopituitarism and infection with SARS-CoV-2., RESULTS: During the span of the infection, the patient remained on the same hormonal therapeutic scheme (thyroid, gonadal and adrenal axis). The dose of hydrocortisone was not changed during the course of the infection as she was asymptomatic. We use telemedicine to control and advise her on the treatment., CONCLUSION: Health care professionals should carefully follow up on the evolution of patients with hypopituitarism to provide them a safer outcome. The use of telemedicine as a methodology for selected patients acquires relevance in the present epidemiological context. Copyright Universidad Nacional de Cordoba.	false
0	LIVER MANIFESTATIONS IN COVID-19 AND THE INFLUENCE OF PRE-EXISTING LIVER DISEASE IN THE COURSE OF THE INFECTION. Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) may be at an increased risk of a severe course due to cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CLD in COVID-19 patients and to analyze the course of the infection, compared with patients with non-liver disease. Material This was a retrospective single center study of all patients with a positive SARS-Cov2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from March 23 to April 30, 2020. Clinical and biochemical data of patients with and without CLD and COVID-19 were collected from the medical records. Result 447 patients with a SARS-Cov2 positive PCR were included, 6.3% had CLD. 69.7% of patients with CLD were male, with a median age of 65.5 years and active alcohol consumption and smoking 75% had non-advanced liver fibrosis and most were Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The hospital admission rate (92.9% vs 47.7% p<0.001), concomitant comorbidities (diabetes 38.5 vs 16.5% p=0.011; obesity 30.8 vs 8.5% p=0.033; cancer 23.1 vs 5% p=0.027 and COPD 19.2 vs 9% p=0.009) and concomitant antibiotics treatment (19.3 vs 5%; p= 0.018) were higher in patients with CLD than those without CLD. In-patient hospital mortality rate were similar in both groups (30.8 vs 19.6% p=0.289). The presence of CLD was not associated with mortality (OR= 1.06; 95% IC= 0.35- 3.18; p=0.924). However, patients with CLD and COVID-19 who were male, obese or under concomitant antibiotic treatment had the highest risk of mortality according to the univariate analysis. Conclusion Patients with CLD had a higher risk of hospital admission, with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 infection associated to other concomitant comorbidities and a suspicion of bacterial co-infection.	false
0	Initial Guidance on Use of Monoclonal Antibody Therapy for Treatment of COVID-19 in Children and Adolescents. BACKGROUND: In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for two novel virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab, and REGN-COV2 (casirivimab plus imdevimab), for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adolescents and adults in specified high-risk groups. This has challenged clinicians to determine the best approach to use of these products., METHODS: A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacy, pediatric intensive care medicine, and pediatric hematology from 29 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a guidance statement was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion., RESULTS: The course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is typically mild and there is no high-quality evidence supporting any high risk groups. There is no evidence for safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, limited evidence of modest benefit in adults, and evidence for potential harm associated with infusion reactions or anaphylaxis., CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence available as of December 20, 2020, the panel suggests against routine administration of monoclonal antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, or casirivimab and imdevimab), for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, including those designated by the FDA as at high risk of progression to hospitalization or severe disease. Clinicians and health systems choosing to use these agents on an individualized basis should consider risk factors supported by pediatric-specific evidence, and ensure implementation of a system for safe and timely administration that does not exacerbate existing healthcare disparities.

0	Comparing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity with other respiratory pathogens points to potential immune mechanisms. Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.	false
0	Community-aquired pneumonia on the background of coronaviral disease (COVID-19): principles of diagnostics and determination of risk factors of pathological process aggravation. The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on the background of COVID-19 is especially actual due to the prevalence of this pathology and the possible aggravation of the pathological process. The aim of our study was to improve the principles of CAP diagnostics on the background of COVID-19 and to determine risk factors for aggravating of the pathological process. Patients with respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 were examined. General clinical research methods were carried out, determination of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by PCR method, computer tomography (CT) to identify the features of lung tissue damage was performed. The main observation group consisted of 37 patients (men-19 (51.4%), average age-61 (57; 69) years) with pneumonia on the background of confirmed COVID-19. According to the severity of coronavirus disease, all patients of the main group were divided into 3 subgroups: subgroup 1 included 17 people with moderate COVID-19, subgroup 2-13 people with severe COVID-19, subgroup 3-7 people with critical COVID-19 course. The levels of markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein (C-RP) and fibrinogen) were also determined. Since patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity (which is characterized by the presence of community-acquired viral pneumonia) belong to the risk group of severe and critical course, it is suggested to consider the following risk factors for aggravating the pathological process as: temperature over 38.5 degrees C, heart rate over 90 per minute, respiratory rate over 20 per minute, SpO(2) <= 93%; absolute lymphopenia (less than 0.9 G/L) and an increase in serum levels of C-RP more than 50 mg/L and fibrinogen more than 5 g/L.	false
0	Rituximab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis: a review. In the last decades, evidence suggesting the direct or indirect involvement of B cells on multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis has accumulated. The increased amount of data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell-depleting therapies from several studies has suggested the addition of these drugs as treatment options to the current armamentarium of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS. Particularly, rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 positive B lymphocytes resulting in cell-mediated apoptosis, has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory activity, incidence of relapses and new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Additional evidence also demonstrated that patients with progressive MS (PMS) may benefit from RTX, which also showed to be well tolerated, with acceptable safety risks and favorable cost-effectiveness profile.Despite these encouraging results, RTX is currently approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, several forms of vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, while it can only be administered off-label for MS treatment. Between Northern European countries exist different rules for using not licensed drug for treating MS. The Sweden MS register reports a high rate (53.5%) of off-label RTX prescriptions in relation to other annually started DMTs to treat MS patients, while Danish and Norwegian neurologists have to use other anti-CD20 drugs, as ocrelizumab, in most of the cases. In this paper, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety profile and cost effectiveness aspects of RTX for the treatment of MS. Particularly, with the approval of new anti-CD20 DMTs, the recent worldwide COVID-19 emergency and the possible increased risk of infection with this class of drugs, this review sheds light on the use of RTX as an alternative treatment option for MS management, while commenting the gaps of knowledge regarding this drug.	false
0	COVID-19 Infodemic Prevalence over 35 Countries. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic, in which a plethora of false information has been rapidly disseminated online, leading to serious harm around the world., OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze the prevalence of common misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic., METHODS: We conducted an online survey via a survey company and social media platforms to ask whether respondents have been exposed to a broad set of false claims regarding the disease and their respective fact-checks., RESULTS: We obtained more than 41,000 responses from 85 countries by 1,257 respondents, and we identified a strong negative correlation between a country's economic status and the prevalence of the misinformation (Spearman's rho=-0.72, P<.001). Our results suggest that fact-checks spread to a lesser degree than their respective false claims following a sublinear trend (beta=0.64)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the potential harm of misinformation could be more substantial for developing countries than developed economies. Countries with poor infrastructures might not only have to combat the spreading pandemic but also the COVID-19 infodemic, which can derail crucial efforts in saving lives., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Association of substance use disorders and drug overdose with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in New York City: January-October 2020. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that individuals with history of substance use disorder (SUD) are at increased risk of COVID-19, but little is known about relationships between SUDs, overdose and COVID-19 severity and mortality. This study investigated risks of severe COVID-19 among patients with SUDs., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of data from a hospital system in New York City. Patient records from 1 January to 26 October 2020 were included. We assessed positive COVID-19 tests, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and death. Descriptive statistics and bivariable analyses compared the prevalence of COVID-19 by baseline characteristics. Logistic regression estimated unadjusted and sex-, age-, race- and comorbidity-adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for associations between SUD history, overdose history and outcomes., RESULTS: Of patients tested for COVID-19 (n = 188 653), 2.7% (n = 5107) had any history of SUD. Associations with hospitalization [AORs (95% confidence interval)] ranged from 1.78 (0.85-3.74) for cocaine use disorder (COUD) to 6.68 (4.33-10.33) for alcohol use disorder. Associations with ICU admission ranged from 0.57 (0.17-1.93) for COUD to 5.00 (3.02-8.30) for overdose. Associations with death ranged from 0.64 (0.14-2.84) for COUD to 3.03 (1.70-5.43) for overdose., DISCUSSION: Patients with histories of SUD and drug overdose may be at elevated risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

0	Sensing of COVID-19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Nanoprinted Reduced-Graphene-Oxide-Coated 3D Electrodes. Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. An advanced nanomaterial-based biosensing platform that detects COVID-19 antibodies within seconds is reported. The biosensing platform is created by 3D nanoprinting of three-dimensional electrodes, coating the electrodes by nanoflakes of reduced-graphene-oxide (rGO), and immobilizing specific viral antigens on the rGO nanoflakes. The electrode is then integrated with a microfluidic device and used in a standard electrochemical cell. When antibodies are introduced on the electrode surface, they selectively bind with the antigens, changing the impedance of the electrical circuit which is detected via impedance spectroscopy. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) are detected at a limit-of-detection of 2.8 x 10-15 and 16.9 x 10-15 m, respectively, and read by a smartphone-based user interface. The sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive sensing of test samples using the same sensor. Sensing of S1 and RBD antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies such as RBD, S1, and nucleocapsid antibody nor with proteins such as interleukin-6. The proposed sensing platform could also be useful to detect biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika. Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.	false
0	Estimation of US SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Symptomatic Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths Using Seroprevalence Surveys. Importance: Estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease burden are needed to help guide interventions., Objective: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16596], May, June, and July [n = 40817], and August [n = 38355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers., Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden., Results: Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16596), May (n = 14291), June (n = 14159), July (n = 12367), and August (n = 38355), there were estimated medians of 46910006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38192705-60814748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28122752 (IQR, 23014957-36438592) symptomatic infections, 956174 (IQR, 782509-1238912) hospitalizations, and 304915 (IQR, 248253-395296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020., Conclusions and Relevance: The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines.	false
0	Optimized workflow for single-cell transcriptomics on infectious diseases including COVID-19. In December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory illness that led to the COVID-19 pandemic, was reported. In the face of such a new pathogen, special precautions must be taken to examine potentially infectious materials due to the lack of knowledge on disease transmissibility, infectivity, and molecular pathogenicity. Here, we present a complete and safe workflow for performing scRNA-seq experiments on blood samples of infected patients from cell isolation to data analysis using the micro-well based BD Rhapsody platform.

0	Gastroenterologists Reveal More Digestive Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients than Nongastroenterologists in Fever Clinic. The incidence of digestive symptoms may vary depending on doctors' professional backgrounds when they inquired suspected COVID-19 patients in a fever clinic. We sought to understand the characteristics of inquiries about digestive symptoms by doctors in different specialties; therefore, inquiry records of 2 gastroenterologists and 6 nongastroenterologists were reviewed. We compared the difference in inquiry of digestive symptoms (diarrhea, vomit, distension, anorexia, and abdominal pain) between these two groups among identified COVID-19 patients. And we further compared the difference of digestive symptoms between confirmed patients and suspected cases who excluded from COVID-19. Among 495 confirmed COVID-19 cases (254 cases by gastroenterologists and 241 cases by nongastroenterologists), 22.83% patients experienced various digestive symptoms in the gastroenterologists' group, while only 4.47% reported digestive symptoms by nongastroenterologists (p < 0.0001). Additionally, among initially suspected 611 patients who presented with similar respiratory symptoms inquired by gastroenterologists, confirmed cases presented far more frequency of digestive symptoms than excluded cases (22.8% vs. 3.64%, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, confirmed patients reported more percentage of watery diarrhea (56% vs. 36%, p < 0.0001) and higher frequent vomit (2.77 +/- 0.97 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.45 per day, p = 0.041) than excluded cases. We concluded that gastroenterologists could detect a greater proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during fever clinic inquiries. Moreover, confirmed COVID-19 patients are more likely to have higher severity in digestive symptoms than excluded cases. Therefore, physicians in fever clinic should pay more attention to the triage of gastrointestinal symptoms. Copyright © 2020 Yudong Jiang et al.	false
0	Self-assembled chromogen-loaded polymeric cocoon for respiratory virus detection. Inspired by the self-assembly approach, in this work, the chromogen, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), was successfully co-precipitated in aqueous solution to form collective nanoparticles (NPs) of signal molecules (TMB-NPs). Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H2O2 with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL-1 and 54.97 fg mL-1 in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL-1 and 143 fg mL-1, respectively. These results show the applicability of the advanced TMB-NPs@PLGA-based colorimetric sensor for the highly sensitive detection of airborne respiratory viruses.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Microarray for Mapping COVID-19 Antibody Interactions at Amino Acid Resolution. Comprehensive profiling of humoral antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) proteins is essential in understanding the host immunity and in developing diagnostic tests and vaccines. To address this concern, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 proteome peptide microarray to analyze antibody interactions at the amino acid resolution. With the array, we demonstrate the feasibility of employing SARS-CoV-1 antibodies to detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The first landscape of B-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum of 10 coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with early infection is also constructed. With array data and structural analysis, a peptide epitope for neutralizing antibodies within the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain's interaction interface with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor was predicted. All the results demonstrate the utility of our microarray as a platform to determine the changes of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients and animal models as well as to identify potential targets for diagnosis and treatment.

0	Optimality in COVID-19 vaccination strategies determined by heterogeneity in human-human interaction networks. Interactions between humans cause transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in human-human interactions give rise to non-linear infection networks that gain complexity with time. Consequently, targeted vaccination strategies are challenged as such effects are not accurately captured by epidemiological models assuming homogeneous mixing. With vaccines being prepared for global deployment determining optimality for swiftly reaching population level immunity in heterogeneous local communities world-wide is critical. We introduce a model that predicts the effect of vaccination into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak using precision simulation of human-human interaction and infection networks. We show that simulations incorporating non-linear network complexity and local heterogeneity can enable governance with performance-quantified vaccination strategies. Vaccinating highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while vaccinating the elderly reduces fatalities at low population level immunity. Interestingly, a combined strategy is not better due to non-linear effects. While risk groups should be vaccinated first to minimize fatalities, significant optimality branching is observed with increasing population level immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that regardless of immunization strategy non-pharmaceutical interventions are required to prevent ICU overload and breakdown of healthcare systems. The approach, adaptable in real-time and applicable to other viruses, provides a highly valuable platform for the current and future pandemics.	false

0	Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Pharmacological Treatments of COVID-19 Patients Not Requiring Hospitalization. INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a whole Earth health emergency related to a highly pathogenic human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between 9 March and 1 May 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described., RESULTS: A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54 +/- 17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively. At multivariate regression model, diabetes (risk ratio (RR): 3.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 13.34; p = 0.04) and hypertension (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.7; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the experimental anti-COVID drug administration. Moreover, only diabetes (RR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.8; p = 0.03) was significantly associated with heparin administration., CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a high prevalence of hypertension, more likely treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS) inhibitors, among COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. Experimental COVID-19 therapies have been prescribed to COVID-19 patients considered at risk for increased venous thromboembolism based on concomitant comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension.	false
0	Impact of coronavirus disease-2019 on chronic respiratory disease in South Korea: an NHIS COVID-19 database cohort study. BACKGROUND: The impact of underlying chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) on the risk and mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the effects of CRDs on the risk of COVID-19 and mortality among the population in South Korea., METHODS: The NHIS-COVID-19 database in South Korea was used for data extraction for this population-based cohort study. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease (ILD), lung cancer, lung disease due to external agents, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tuberculosis of the lungs (TB) were considered CRDs. The primary endpoint was a diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 1st and June 4th, 2020; the secondary endpoint was hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: The final analysis included 122,040 individuals, 7669 (6.3%) were confirmed as COVID-19 until 4 June 2020, and 251 patients with COVID-19 (3.2%) passed away during hospitalization. Among total 122,040 individuals, 36,365 individuals were diagnosed with CRD between 2015 and 2019: COPD (4488, 3.6%), asthma (33,858, 27.2%), ILD (421, 0.3%), lung cancer (769, 0.6%), lung disease due to external agents (437, 0.4%), OSA (550, 0.4%), and TB (608, 0.5%). Among the CRDs, patients either with ILD or OSA had 1.63-fold (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-2.26; P = 0.004) and 1.65-fold higher (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.23-2.16; P < 0.001) incidence of COVID-19. In addition, among patients with COVID-19, the individuals with COPD and lung disease due to external agents had 1.56-fold (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.2; P = 0.024) and 3.54-fold (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.70-7.38; P < 0.001) higher risk of hospital mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OSA and ILD might have an increased risk of COVID-19. In addition, COPD and chronic lung disease due to external agents might be associated with a higher risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest that prevention and management strategies should be carefully performed.	false
0	Evaluating a SARS-CoV-2 screening strategy based on serological tests. BACKGROUND: facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies., OBJECTIVES: to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects., METHODS: a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number., RESULTS: assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Resources and false negatives increase with the prevalence., CONCLUSIONS: the analysed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time.	false
0	Improved plaque assay for human coronaviruses 229E and OC43. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies that work to understand SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. In turn, the less severe human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and OC43 are drawing newfound attention. These less severe coronaviruses can be used as a model to facilitate our understanding of the host immune response to coronavirus infection. SARS-CoV-2 must be handled under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Therefore, HCoV-229E and OC43, which can be handled at BSL-2 provide an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 for preclinical screening and designing of antivirals. However, to date, there is no published effective and efficient method to titrate HCoVs other than expensive indirect immunostaining. Here we present an improved approach using an agarose-based conventional plaque assay to titrate HCoV 229E and OC43 with mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu. Our results indicate that titration of HCoV 229E and OC43 with Mv1Lu is consistent and reproducible. The titers produced are also comparable to those produced using human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. More importantly, Mv1Lu cells display a higher tolerance for cell-cell contact stress, decreased temperature sensitivity, and a faster growth rate. We believe that our improved low-cost plaque assay can serve as an easy tool for researchers conducting HCoV research. Copyright © 2020 Bracci et al.	false
0	Characteristics and Effectiveness of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Prevention and Control in a Representative City in China. BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic. Control measures differ among countries. It is necessary to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected the data of COVID-19 patients and control measures between January 18, 2020 and September 18, 2020 from the Changshou District and analyzed the clinical characteristics, epidemiological data, and the adjustment of policies to assess the effectiveness of control measures. The control of COVID-19 was divided into 2 stages, with the lifting of lockdown in Hubei province (March 25, 2020) as a dividing line. RESULTS We identified 32 patients through different means in the first stage. All the imported patients entered this area before the lockdown. In 93.1% of patients, the last exposure occurred before the implementation of the stay-at-home order and centralized isolation. Tracing of high-risk people and RT-PCR screening identified 56.3% of cases. In the second stage, all the high-risk people were under centralized isolation. Nine asymptomatic patients were identified. City lockdown and stay-at-home orders were not issued again, and no second-generation patients were found. CONCLUSIONS We have provided a successful model to control the transmission of COVID-19 in a short period.	false
0	A demographic scaling model for estimating the total number of COVID-19 infections. BACKGROUND: Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical information for monitoring the pandemic. The actual number of infections potentially exceeds the number of confirmed cases., DEVELOPMENT: We develop a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections, based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19-related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack IFR estimates, we scale them from a reference country based on remaining lifetime to better match the context in a target population with respect to age structure, health conditions and medical services. We introduce formulas to account for bias in input data and provide a heuristic to assess whether local seroprevalence estimates are representative for the total population., APPLICATION: Across 10 countries with most reported COVID-19 deaths as of 23 July 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be three [95% prediction interval: 2-8] times the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 5.3 million for the USA, 1.8 million for the UK, 1.4 million for France, and 0.4 million for Peru, or more than one, six, seven and more than one times the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Our central prevalence estimates for entire countries are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies., CONCLUSIONS: The national infection estimates indicate that the pandemic is far more widespread than the numbers of confirmed cases suggest. Some local seroprevalence estimates largely deviate from their corresponding national mean and are unlikely to be representative for the total population. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	REAL-TIME MECHANISTIC BAYESIAN FORECASTS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019. In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and management of COVID-19 patients accessing the emergency department in a hospital in Northern Italy in March and April 2020. BACKGROUND: the emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic struck the national and regional health system that needed an effort to reorganise and increase resources to cope with a sudden, uncertain, and previously unknown situation. This study was conducted in the immediate aftermath of this difficult period., OBJECTIVES: to describe clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, and management of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that accessed the emergency department (ED) of the San Luigi Gonzaga hospital of Orbassano (Turin district, Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) in March and April 2020. Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time., DESIGN: comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED., CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed.	false
0	A SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy score card. The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an unprecedented effort to identify efficacious treatments for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. As of September 2020, more than 750 completed, ongoing, or planned clinical trials of drugs intended to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication have been registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov or WHO International Clinical Trials Platform websites. Most of the treatments studied in these trials are repurposed licensed or investigational drugs targeting viral proteins or cellular pathways required for virus replication. The use of repurposed compounds is understandable because with the exception of monoclonal antibodies, it will be several months before novel SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs will be available for human testing. This editorial describes those compounds that I believe should be prioritized for clinical testing: i) viral RNA polymerase inhibitors including GS-441524, its prodrug remdesivir, and EIDD-2801; ii) entry inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 molecular decoys, and peptide fusion inhibitors; iii) parenteral and inhalational preparations of interferon beta and lambda; and iv) inhibitors of host transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), endosomal trafficking, and pyrimidine synthesis. As SARS-CoV-2 is pandemic and as its most severe consequences result from a dysregulated immunological response to infection, the ideal therapies should be inexpensive and should be able to be administered to non-hospitalized persons at the time of their initial diagnosis.

0	"Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences in a national cohort in the United States. In order to understand preferences about SARS-CoV-2 testing, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among 4793 participants in the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING COVID) Cohort Study from July 30-September 8, 2020. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. ""Comprehensive testers"" (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. ""Fast track testers"" (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. ""Dual testers"" (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. ""Non-invasive dual testers"" (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. ""Home testers"" (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and found that offering additional testing options, which consider this heterogeneity, would likely increase testing uptake., SIGNIFICANCE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic testing has allowed for early detection of cases and implementation of measures to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding individuals' preferences about testing and the service models that deliver tests are relevant in efforts to increase and sustain uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing, which, despite vaccine availability, will be required for the foreseeable future. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a discrete choice experiment among a large national cohort of adults in the US. Offering additional testing options that account for or anticipate this heterogeneity in preferences (e.g., both viral and antibody tests, at home testing), would likely increase testing uptake., Classification: Biological Sciences (major); Psychological and Cognitive Sciences (minor)."	false
0	[Management protocol and outcome assessment of ruptured intracranial aneurysm emergency surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic]. Objective: To explore the improvement of emergency admission screening and perioperative management protocols in the scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its regular prevention and control for patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, which are the most common emergency cases with the most urgent needs for emergent surgery. Methods: The response protocol of the emergency surgical management of ruptured intracranial aneurysm during the epidemic period (from January to March, 2020) at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University was reviewed. The prognosis of emergent aneurysm surgery under different levels of protection or during the same period of 2019 and 2020 was further compared to describe the operation and prognosis under the new management protocol. Results: A total of 127 emergency cases with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were referred to Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 20 to March 25, 2020, and 42 cases(33.1%) underwent emergent aneurysm clipping after multi-desciplinary consultation. Admissions of emergency cases required epidemiological, laboratory, and imaging screenings for COVID-19, with additional throat swab virus nucleic acid screening afterwards. During the same period, 9 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the emergency screening, and no false negative cases were found. Compared with the same period in 2019, the interval between emergency visits and emergency craniotomy did not increase significantly due to the preoperative screening ((37+/-17) hours during the epidemic period versus (29+/-12) hours at the same period in 2019, P=0.058). There was no significant difference in the incidence of perioperative adverse events and postoperative neurological dysfunction (P=0.779). According to the screening results, the corresponding operative and postoperative management protocol and protection standards were adopted. There was no significant difference in the prognosis of emergent surgery between patients with a negative initial screening and those who were to be excluded or suspected in the initial screening (P=0.678). Although viral nucleic acid screening tended to prolong the time interval before surgical intervention ((36+/-15) hours before nucleic acid screening versus (40+/-20) hours after nucleic acid screening, P=0.453), there was no statistically significant difference in the preoperative adverse events and postoperative neurological function (P=0.653). Conclusion:  The current protocol of COVID-19 screening and stratified emergent surgery management based on screening results can effectively identify suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases, thereby ensuring timely, safe and effective emergent surgery and prohibiting nosocomial spread.	false
0	Unraveling the mechanism of arbidol binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2: Insights from atomistic simulations. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an antiinfluenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is found to be superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to the host cells. However, the detailed mechanism through which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition by arbidol for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol could generate favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, resulting in a restriction of the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.

Only limited data describe the efforts to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. We describe our experience engaging persons recovered from COVID-19 to donate CCP., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the CCP recruitment for an 11-hospital health system in Houston, Texas. We sought CCP donations from: a) ""volunteers"" responding to advertisements in social media, press releases and websites, and b) ""referred"" individuals directed to the program or identified from hospitalization records. We determined the proportions of donor candidates who passed initial telephone health screening, who qualified after diagnostic testing, who presented to the regional CCP donation center, and who completed CCP donation., RESULTS: There were 900 CCP donor candidates, including 363 volunteers and 537 referred donors. Of 360 contacted volunteers, 186 (5.7%) were excluded by interview; 133 were referred for additional diagnostic screening, 97 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 87 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 35 CCP donations (9.7% of initial telephone contacts). Among 533 referred donors, 448 (84.1%) were excluded by interview, 71 were referred for additional screening, 48 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 40 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 1 CCP donation (0.2% of initial telephone contacts)., CONCLUSION: In this community, screening of a high number of candidates yielded a limited number of CCP donations. These observations have important implications for CCP donor recruitment and community pandemic planning. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."	false
0	2019 novel coronavirus disease with secondary ischemic stroke: two case reports. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out in Wuhan in 2019, has become the global health crisis of our time. Elderly patients with certain fundamental diseases are more likely to develop severe cases. The secondary lesion following viral infection have only rarely been reported., CASE PRESENTATION: We here report two cases of coronavirus-infected pneumonia with acute ischemic stroke in middle-aged patients. In both COVID-19 cases, neurological physical examinations showed normal results before infection. Lymphocytopenia, accompanied by elevated cytokines and D-dimers, were found from serum clinical laboratory examination at admission. Dysarthria and limb muscle weakness are initial manifestations, occurring one week after infect-causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. The head CT and head/neck arterial CTA showed small-vessel occlusion. The patients were diagnosed with coronavirus diseases with secondary acute ischemic stroke. They were treated with tirofiban and followed up with daily aspirin and atorvastatin., CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggested that secondary ischemic stroke, mainly manifested as small-vessel occlusion, should be considered for COVID-19 patients and diagnosed and treated promptly.	false
0	"Predictors for County Level Variations in Initial 4-week COVID-19 Incidence and Case Fatality Risk in the United States. While studies indicate differences in incidence and case fatality risk of COVID-19, few efforts have shed light on regional variations in the intensity of initial community spread. We conducted a nationwide study using county-level data on COVID-19 from Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We characterized intensity of initial community COVID-19 attack by calculating the incidence and case fatality risk (CFR) for the first 4-week period of COVID-19 spread in each county. We used multivariate multilevel multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association of county-level characteristics with COVID-19 incidence and CFR. Of 3,143 counties, we included 1,052 with at least 100 reported cases on June 1st. Median incidence was 193.4 per 100,000 population (IQR: 94.2-397.5). Median case fatality risk was 3.6% (IQR: 1.4a""7.3). Median age, rural population, population density, lower education, uninsured population, obesity, COPD prevalence were positively associated, while population, female sex, races (Asian, white), higher education, excessive drinking were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 incidence. Median age, female sex, Asian race, population density, higher education, excessive drinking, Intensive Care Unit beds, airborne infection isolation rooms were positively associated, while Hispanic ethnicity, lower education, obesity (paradox), uninsured population were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 CFR."	false
0	Cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies with diverse epitope specificities and extra-neutralization functions. The continual emergence of novel coronavirus (CoV) strains, like SARS-CoV-2, highlights the critical need for broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines against this family of viruses. Coronavirus spike (S) proteins share common structural motifs that could be vulnerable to cross-reactive antibody responses. To study this phenomenon in human coronavirus infection, we applied a high-throughput sequencing method called LIBRA-seq (Linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing) to a SARS-CoV-1 convalescent donor sample. We identified and characterized a panel of six monoclonal antibodies that cross-reacted with S proteins from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated a spectrum of reactivity against other coronaviruses. Epitope mapping revealed that these antibodies recognized multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S, including the receptor binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and S2 subunit. Functional characterization demonstrated that the antibodies mediated a variety of Fc effector functions in vitro and mitigated pathological burden in vivo . The identification of cross-reactive epitopes recognized by functional antibodies expands the repertoire of targets for pan-coronavirus vaccine design strategies that may be useful for preventing potential future coronavirus outbreaks.	false
0	Asymptomatic Cases and Limited Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Residents and Healthcare Workers in Three Dutch Nursing Homes. We aimed to assess the contribution of a- and presymptomatic residents and healthcare workers in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, including standardized symptom assessment and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, among 297 residents and 542 healthcare workers of three Dutch nursing homes (NHs) with recent SARS-CoV-2 introduction. At the first point-prevalence survey, 15 residents tested positive of which one was presymptomatic and three remained asymptomatic. At the second point-prevalence survey one resident and one healthcare worker tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and both remained asymptomatic. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified, this study confirms a- and presymptomatic occurrence of Covid-19. We additionally describe factors that may contribute to the prevention of transmission. Taken together, our study complements the discussion on effective SARS-CoV-2 screening in NHs.	false
0	Development and characterization of an indirect ELISA to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. The current Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern. Sensitive and precise diagnostic tools are urgently needed. In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2S1 ELISA was found to be specific [97.8% (95% CI, 96.7% - 98.5%)], reproducible and precise (intra-assay coefficient of variability (CV) 5.3%, inter-assay CV 7.9%). A standard curve and the interpolation of arbitrary ELISA units per milliliter served to reduce the variability between different tests and operators. Cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses was addressed by using sera positive for MERS-CoV- and hCoV HKU1-specific antibodies. Monitoring antibody development in various samples of twenty-three and single samples of twenty-nine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients revealed seroconversion and neutralizing antibodies against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in all cases. The comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 (S1) ELISA with a commercially available assay showed a better sensitivity for the in-house ELISA. The results demonstrate a high reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity of the newly developed ELISA, which is suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2S1 protein-specific antibody responses.

0	COVID-19 molecular level laboratory diagnoses. AbstractAIMS: Aims: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused not only global pandemic, but it also pointed at unprepared health care systems and countermeasures were introduced under the pressure of urgent circumstances. This review is focused on discussion and critical evaluation of instrumental tools for COVID-19 diagnosis that were developed in the last months., METHODS: Survey of actual literature and scientific reports was made. The most substantial analytical and diagnostical methods were identified and described. Principles and limitations of the methods are described, and actual papers are cited in this review., RESULTS: Analytical and diagnostical methods like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Lateral Flow Immunochromatography Assay (LFIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), biosensors and ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA) are discussed for assay of viral particles, antigens and specific host antibodies in blood, serum, plasma, nasopharyngeal swab and other samples in order to diagnose COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has spread over the world since the end of year 2019. The global epidemic pointed at the necessity to introduce sensitive methods for instrumental diagnosis of COVID-19 and distinguishing it from the other viral diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 96).	false
0	Adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and diabetes: a retrospective cohort study from three London teaching hospitals. INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have poorer outcomes. However, the drivers of poorer outcomes are not fully elucidated. We performed detailed characterization of patients with COVID-19 to determine the clinical and biochemical factors that may be drivers of poorer outcomes., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 889 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 9 and April 22, 2020 in a large London National Health Service Trust. Unbiased multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of death and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis., RESULTS: 62% of patients in our cohort were of non-white ethnic background and the prevalence of diabetes was 38%. 323 (36%) patients met the primary outcome of death/admission to the ICU within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, lower platelet count, advancing age and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (but not diabetes) independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission. Factors that were significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were coexisting ischemic heart disease, increasing age and lower platelet count., CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of a diverse patient population, comorbidity (ie, diabetes with ischemic heart disease; increasing CFS score in older patients) was a major determinant of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Antiplatelet medication should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials among high-risk patient groups. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

0	ACE2 polymorphisms as potential players in COVID-19 outcome. The clinical condition COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Currently, there are more than 5 million cases worldwide, and the pandemic has increased exponentially in many countries, with different incidences and death rates among regions/ethnicities and, intriguingly, between sexes. In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences. In conclusion, there are ACE2 polymorphisms that could influence epidemiological discrepancies observed among ancestry and, moreover, between sexes.	false

The results of a study in the population residing in Sicily Region (Southern Italy)]. OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the effects of a pre-existing condition of diabetes and of the use of antidiabetic drugs in the Sicilian population on different outcomes of the COVID-19 disease., DESIGN: a retrospective observational study based was used. Data deriving from the COVID-19 epidemic surveillance and from the collection of information on drugs consume by Sicilian residents., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: due to the data availability, the study was calibrated on the Region and included all population distinguishing by gender and age groups., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the risks of cumulative incidence for COVID-19 were investigated in people who had diabetes comorbidities to incur a hospitalization for COVID-19, to be treated within an intensive care unit, and lethality. The role of previous antidiabetic drug treatments with respect to each study outcome was also investigated., RESULTS: in Sicily, from 01.03.2020 to 26.06.2020, a number of 172 cases of COVID-19 disease with diabetes comorbidity were diagnosed. The data did not show any difference in the cumulative incidence for COVID-19 between diabetics (64.2/100,000 inhabitants) and non-diabetics (56.9/100,000 inhabitants) patients. Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization in the under 80 in both men and women (men: OR 2.62; women OR 4.31), for treatment in intensive care (men: OR 4,41; women: OR 7.74), and for death (men: OR 5.21; women OR 5.92). The analysis of drug using showed risks effect of insulin (OR 2.13) on hospitalization, sulfonylureas/glinides (OR 2.58) on intensive care and protective of metformin on death both in single component (OR 0.44) and in multicomponent (OR 0.43)., CONCLUSIONS: data availability made it possible to monitor the occurrence and explore some of the characteristics of the cases with COVID-19 in Sicily. Diabetes does not seem to represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sicily, while previous diabetes condition seems to determine greater risk of hospitalization, treatment in intensive care, and lethality among over 80. There are also gender differences with almost double risks in women for hospitalization and intensive care only. Among the antidiabetic drugs investigated, there was a risk for hospitalization and intensive care while protective for deaths. This study represents an important tool for the activation of intervention programmes in the area aimed at populations with greater health risk deriving from the effects of this new pandemic.	false
0	Mortality and renal outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in a provisional intensive care unit. COVID-19 has created an enormous health crisis and this spring New York City had a severe outbreak that pushed health and critical care resources to the limit. A lack of adequate space for mechanically ventilated patients induced our hospital to convert operating rooms into critical care areas (OR-ICU). A large number of COVID-19 will develop acute kidney injury that requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). We included 116 patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation and were cared for in our OR-ICU. At 90 days and at discharge 35 patients died (30.2%). RRT was required by 45 of the 116 patients (38.8%) and 18 of these 45 patients (40%) compared to 17 with no RRT (23.9%, ns) died during hospitalization and after 90 days. Only two of the 27 patients who required RRT and survived required RRT at discharge and 90 days. When defining renal recovery as a discharge serum creatinine within 150% of baseline, 68 of 78 survivors showed renal recovery (87.2%). Survival was similar to previous reports of patients with severe COVID-19 for patients cared for in provisional ICUs compared to standard ICUs. Most patients with severe COVID-19 and AKI are likely to recover full renal function. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	How Useful is COVID-19 Antibody Testing - A Current Assessment for Oncologists. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to infection by a new human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has seriously disrupted the provision of oncology services and their uptake. Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both adequate sensitivity and specificity. This review seeks to educate healthcare workers, particularly those working in oncology, of the current benefits and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

0	Safety in Digestive Endoscopy during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We read with interest the study by Hernandez-Camba et al. (1) about the little value found in antibody testing for Covid-19 before endoscopic procedures and we would like to make some comments Nine months after the first state of alarm was declared in Spain due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, we know that infections in endoscopy staff are scarce if adequate protection is worn and non-urgent procedures are postponed in patients with active infection. Therefore, the conclusions of the study appear to be, currently, self-evident. However, things were different at the time it was done. The study was performed during endoscopic activity resumption, after almost a full stop of most non-urgent endoscopic procedures. Furthemore, at that time, PCR tests on nasopharyngeal exudate were not widely available.	false
0	Sustained Vaccination Coverage during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic in the Republic of Korea. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination coverage may decline due to limited accessibility to healthcare. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination coverage and the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in the Republic of Korea. National vaccination coverage of 10 essential vaccines administered to children between January-June 2019 and January-June 2020 was analyzed. The national incidence of selected VPDs was compared for the corresponding periods. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the vaccination rate in children aged 0-35 months in Korea did not decrease significantly, whereas the vaccination rate for children aged 4-6 years decreased by 1.4-1.9%. The overall incidence of VPDs decreased by 10-50% between 2019 and 2020, especially with varicella. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a decrease in vaccination coverage among Korean children, which prevented a surge in VPD incidence. Maintaining essential vaccination coverage without interruption is important during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers and the General Population During the COVID-19 in Italy. Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers in Italy have been exposed to an unprecedented pressure and traumatic events. However, no direct comparison with the general population is available so far. The aim of this study is to detail mental health outcomes in healthcare workers compared to the general population., Methods: 24050 respondents completed an on-line questionnaire during the contagion peak, 21342 general population, 1295 second-line healthcare workers, and 1411 front-line healthcare workers. Depressive, anxious, post-traumatic symptoms and insomnia were assessed. Specific COVID-19 related potential risk factors were also considered in healthcare workers., Results: Depressive symptoms were more frequent in the general population (28.12%) and front-line healthcare workers (28.35%) compared to the second-line healthcare workers (19.98%) groups. Anxiety symptoms showed a prevalence of 21.25% in the general population, 18.05% for second-line healthcare workers, and 20.55% for front-line healthcare workers. Insomnia showed a prevalence of 7.82, 6.58, and 9.92% for the general population, second-line healthcare workers, and front-line healthcare workers, respectively. Compared to the general population, front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing total trauma-related symptoms. Both second-line healthcare workers and front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing core post-traumatic symptoms compared to the general population, while second-line healthcare workers had lower odds of endorsing negative affect and dissociative symptoms. Higher total traumatic symptom score was associated with being a front-line healthcare worker, having a colleague infected, hospitalized, or deceased, being a nurse, female gender, and younger age., Conclusion: This study suggests a significant psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian general population and healthcare workers. Front-line healthcare workers represent a specific at-risk population for post-traumatic symptoms. These findings underline the importance of monitoring and intervention strategies.

0	Ethics committees in the time of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: ethics committees (ECs) protect the rights, safety, and well-being of research participants and ensure the scientific correctness of clinical research. COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs., OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown., DESIGN: cross-sectional survey., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19., RESULTS: 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.	false
0	Air Evacuation of Service Members for COVID-19 in U.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command From 11 March 2020 Through 30 September 2020. This report documents the numbers of air evacuations for diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among U.S. active duty service members (ADSMs) from locations in U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and U.S. European Command (EUCOM) areas of responsibility. Counted were COVID-19 evacuations both within and out of each of the theaters from 11 March through 30 September 2020. Of the 186 evacuations originating in CENTCOM, 185 resulted in the patients arriving at Landstuhl in EUCOM and 1 was within theater. A total of 169 of the CENTCOM evacuations took place in June through August 2020 and only 1 occurred in September. Of the 39 air evacuations originating in EUCOM, 38 were intra-theater transfers and 1 was to a CONUS facility. Most (n=32) of the EUCOM evacuations occurred in September. Evacuees were most often members of the Army (71%), enlisted personnel (63%), males (91%), and aged 30 years or older (58%). Among a random sample of 56 evacuees, 20% were asymptomatic. Among those with symptoms, the most common were cough, fatigue, congestion, headache, and sore throat.	false
0	Do they really wash their hands? Prevalence estimates for personal hygiene behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic based on indirect questions. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, billions of people have to change their behaviours to slow down the spreading of the virus. Protective measures include self-isolation, social (physical) distancing and compliance with personal hygiene rules, particularly regular and thorough hand washing. Prevalence estimates for the compliance with the COVID-19 measures are often based on direct self-reports. However, during a health crisis there is strong public pressure to comply with health and safety regulations so that people's responding in direct self-reports may be seriously compromised by social desirability., METHODS: In an online survey, an indirect questioning technique was used to test whether the prevalence of hygiene practices may be lower than in conventional surveys when confidentiality of responding is guaranteed. The Extended Crosswise Model is an indirect questioning technique that guarantees the confidentiality of responding. To the degree that direct self-reports are biased by social desirability, prevalence estimates of hygiene practices such as thorough hand washing based on the Extended Crosswise Model should be lower than those based on direct self-reports., RESULTS: We analysed data of 1434 participants. In the direct questioning group 94.5% of the participants claimed to practice proper hand hygiene; in the indirect questioning group a significantly lower estimate of only 78.1% was observed., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that estimates of the degree of commitment to measures designed to counter the spread of the disease may be significantly inflated by social desirability in direct self-reports. Indirect questioning techniques with higher levels of confidentiality seem helpful in obtaining more realistic estimates of the degree to which people follow the recommended personal hygiene measures. More realistic estimates of compliance can help to inform and to adjust public information campaigns on COVID-19 hygiene recommendations.	false
0	Considerations for Pooled Testing of Employees for SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: To identify important background information on pooled tested of employees that employers workers, and health authorities should consider., METHODS: This paper is a commentary based on the review by the authors of pertinent literature generally from preprints in medrixiv.org prior to August 2020., RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Pooled testing may be particularly useful to employers in communities with low prevalence of COVID-19. It can be used to reduce the number of tests and associated financial costs. For effective and efficient pooled testing employers should consider it as part of a broader, more comprehensive workplace COVID-19 prevention and control program. Pooled testing of asymptomatic employees can prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and help assure employers and customers that employees are not infectious.

0	The Incidence and Mortality Ratio of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accidents in COVID-19 Cases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily known as a respiratory illness; however, a wide variety of symptoms and complications of the central nervous system (CNS), such as ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) have been reported. Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with CVA to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.

0	A longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients reveals a high correlation between neutralizing antibodies and COVID-19 severity. Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection against reinfection and, thus, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19. In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.	false
0	Thirty-day suicidal thoughts and behaviors among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are a key occupational group at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). We investigated the prevalence and correlates of STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak (March-July 2020)., METHODS: Data come from the baseline assessment of a cohort of Spanish hospital workers (n = 5450), recruited from 10 hospitals just after the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (May 5-July 23, 2020). Web-based self-report surveys assessed 30-day STB, individual characteristics, and potentially modifiable contextual factors related to hospital workers' work and financial situation., RESULTS: Thirty-day STB prevalence was estimated at 8.4% (4.9% passive ideation only, 3.5% active ideation with or without a plan or attempt). A total of n = 6 professionals attempted suicide in the past 30 days. In adjusted models, 30-day STB remained significantly associated with pre-pandemic lifetime mood (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92) and anxiety disorder (OR = 1.90). Significant modifiable factors included a perceived lack of coordination, communication, personnel, or supervision at work (population-attributable risk proportion [PARP] = 50.5%), and financial stress (PARP = 44.1%)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Thirty-day STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak was high. Hospital preparedness for virus outbreaks should be increased, and strong governmental policy response is needed to increase financial security among hospital workers. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis in Paris: A differential psychological impact between regular intensive care unit staff members and reinforcement workers. BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilise staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on regular ICU staff members and reinforcement workers., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-assessment questionnaires were completed by HCWs who worked from March 1 to April 30, 2020, in our 16-bed neurological ICU at La Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID ICU. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively., RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.

0	Mental Health of Flying Cabin Crews: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Objectives: Initially, we analyzed relations between the challenging working conditions of flight attendants with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. As the COVID-19 pandemic plunged airlines into an unprecedented crisis, its impact on the mental health of flying cabin crews became the focus of a second survey. Methods: Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (N = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (N = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). Results: Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of d = 0.63 for depression, d = 0.26 for anxiety, and d = 0.52 for stress. The incidence of clinically relevant symptoms among the respondents increased from 8 to 23% (depression), from 6 to 14% (anxiety), and from 8 to 24% (stress). Conclusion:  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated work restrictions coincide with severe impairment of mental health of flying cabin crews, consistent with a mental health protecting function of labor.

0	Migration and Outbreaks of Vaccine-Preventable Disease in Europe: A Systematic Review. <h4>Background: </h4> Migrant populations (defined as foreign-born) are one of several under-immunised groups in the EU/EEA, yet little is known about how they are affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities and to assess risk factors and correlations with major European peaks in incidence of key VPDs over time. Methods We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health January 2000 to October 2019) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on VPD outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, N meningitidis, and H influenzae) in migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Results 45 studies were included, reporting on 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 countries (26 [55%] were reported between 2010 and 2020, including 16 [34%] since 2015). Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6578 total cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 596 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1510 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n=2; 295 cases). 19 (40%) of outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary camps or shelters for asylum seekers and refugees. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, 82% were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=12) were associated with migrants from Eastern European countries, often involving migrants of Roma ethnicity. Conclusions Migrants represent one of several under-immunised groups involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees and asylum seekers residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and individual demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies for implementing catch-up vaccination to specific groups, alongside the strengthening of routine data collection, in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets. Better understanding vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups, and reducing the barriers they face to accessing vaccination services, is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery at the current time. Strengthening vaccine delivery to migrant populations will require a greater focus on co-designing vaccine uptake strategies in close collaboration with affected communities. Funder: NIHR	false
0	Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses., METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics., RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50)., CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	"The biobank of the ASST ""papa Giovanni XXIII"" of Bergamo: Role and opportunity in the pandemic context Covid-19. AIM The aim of this work is to describe the role of the ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII Research Biobank (ASST-PG23) of Bergamo in the Covid19 pandemic context. Lombardy was the most affected Italian Region and the province of Bergamo has registered 14177 cases (June 23, 2020). For this reason, the ASST-PG23 can plays an important role in sample collection and analytic research. MATERIALS AND METHODS The ASST-PG23, established in 2014 and UNI EN ISO 9001: 2015 certified, is a non-profit Service Unit for the collection, preparation and storage of biological material. The ASST-PG23 covers the lack of a centralized and reliable system for the storage of biological samples and associated epidemiological clinical data. The ASST-PG23 contributes to the research by providing a large quantity of samples indispensable for the results to be statistically valid.After the Pandemic COVID-19 infectious pathology, the Biobank and Database project for Clinical and Basic Research in SARS-COV-2 infections was developed with the aim of preserving clinical samples and data for the development of retrospective studies and future prospect studies to be submitted to the Ethical Competence Committee. The ASST-PG23 is equipped with laboratory instrumentations, rooms with electronic controlled access, 27 freezers (-20 degree C/-70 degree C) with remote control, 10 liquid nitrogen containers and finally the software for the management of samples and data ""Freezerworks"" which guarantees anonymization and traceability complete the equipment. RESULTS The ASST-PG23 increased its activities by carrying out the biobanking of 10288 aliquots belonging to 4719 patients discharged or hospitalized by the ASST-PG23 First Aid or in post-discharge follow-up, and healthcare personnel under surveillance for the infection, as at June 26, 2020.In particular, 1256 respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swab and broncho-alveolar lavage) and 8812 blood aliquots (plasma, serum, whole blood) were collected, including the positive serum for neutralizing IgG anti SARS-COV-2 deriving from the surveillance of healthcare personnel and anyone who has been in contact with them as defined by the Lombardy Region.ASSTPG23 samples have currently been used to start about 20 research projects, representing one of the most important assets available to the national and international scientific community. From May 2020, the ASST-PG23 is part of the Italian Node of the European Research Infrastructure of Biobanks and BioMolecular Resources (BBMRI-ERIC). CONCLUSIONS ASST-PG23 represents an important bioresource for diagnosis and research. Initially the samples were collected spontaneously and unevenly within our hospital. With the institution of the ASST-PG23 the samples were organized according to national and international standards. After reaching this primary objective, the ASST-PG23 during the pandemic period, continued with the implementation of the COVID-19 sample collection. This implementation is considered as a precious resource for collaborative studies, to develop knowledge scientific useful to produce new accurate and fast diagnosis systems as well as effective vaccines and antiviral drugs."	false
0	Evaluation of Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2: Diagnostic Value of a New Multiplex Addressable Laser Bead Immunoassay. Despite efforts to develop anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody (Ab) immunoassays, reliable serological methods are still needed. We developed a multiplex addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) to detect and quantify anti-Spike S1 and nucleocapsid N Abs. Recombinant S1 and N proteins were bound to fluorescent beads (ALBIA-IgG-S1/N). Abs were revealed using class-specific anti-human Ig Abs. The performances of the test were analyzed on 575 serum samples including 192 from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed patients, 13 from seasonal coronaviruses, 70 from different inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, and 300 from healthy donors. Anti-S1 IgM were detected by monoplex ALBIA-IgM-S1. Comparison with chemiluminescent assays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was performed using commercial tests. Multiplex ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was effective in detecting and quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abs. Two weeks after first symptoms, sensitivity and specificity were 97.7 and 98.0% (anti-S1), and 100 and 98.7% (anti-N), respectively. Agreement with commercial tests was good to excellent, with a higher sensitivity of ALBIA. ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was positive in 53% of patients up to day 7, and in 75% between days 7 and 13. For ALBIA-IgM-S1, sensitivity and specificity were 74.4 and 98.7%, respectively. Patients in intensive care units had higher IgG Ab levels (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05). ALBIA provides a robust method for exploring humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Serology should be performed after 2 weeks following first symptoms, when all COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients had at least one anti-S1 or anti-N IgG Ab, illustrating the interest of a multiplex test.

0	Predicting Disease Severity and Outcome in COVID-19 Patients. Context.-An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed. Objective.-To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources.-A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non-peer-reviewed preprints. Conclusions.-Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements, were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, or COVID-19 Severity Score, may be used to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited because of the study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.	false
0	"Controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine chemoprophylaxis in SARS CoV2 infection in healthcare personnel in the hospital setting: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection presents a high transmission in the group of health professionals in Spain (12-15% infected). Currently there is no accepted chemoprophylaxis but hydroxychloroquine (HDQ) is known to inhibit the coronavirus in vitro. Our hypothesis is that oral administration of hydroxychloroquine to healthcare professionals can reduce the incidence and prevalence of infection as well as its severity in this group.MethodsDesign: Prospective, single center, double blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). Participants: Adult health-care professionals (18-65 years) working in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 (COVID areas, Intensive Care Unit -ICUs-, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included. Exclusion criteria include previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or IgG serology), pregnancy or lactation, any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine or evidence of unstable or clinically significant systemic disease.InterventionsPatients will be randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily oral Hydroxychloroquine 200mg for two months (HC group) or placebo (P group) in addition to the protective measures appropriate to the level of exposure established by the hospital. A serological evaluation will be carried out every 15 days with PCR in case of seroconversion, symptoms or risk exposure. Primary outcome is the percentage of subjects presenting infection (seroconversion and/or PCR +ve) by the SARS-Cov-2 virus during the observation period. Additionally, both the percentage of subjects in each group presenting Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 >= 2) and that of subjects requiring admission to ICU will be determined.DiscussionWhile awaiting a vaccine, hygiene measures, social distancing and personal protective equipment are the only primary prophylaxis measures against SARS-CoV-2, but they have not been sufficient to protect our healthcare professionals. Some evidence of the in vitro efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against this virus is known, along with some clinical data that would support the study of this drug in the chemoprophylaxis of infection. However, there are still no data from controlled clinical trials in this regard. If our hypothesis is confirmed, hydroxychloroquine can help professionals fight this infection with more guarantees.ParticipantsThis is a single-center study that will be carried out at the Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital.450 health professionals working at the Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS COV2 (COVID hospital areas, Intensive Care Unit, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included.Inclusion criteria: 1) Health professionals aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) at the time of the first screening visit; 2) They must provide signed written informed consent and agree to comply with the study protocol; 3) Active work in high exposure areas during the last two weeks and during the following weeks. Exclusion criteria: 1) Previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive coronavirus PCR or positive serology with SARS Cov2 negative PCR and absence of symptoms); 2) Current treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine; 3) Hypersensitivity, allergy or any contraindication for taking hydroxychloroquine, in the technical sheet; 4) Previous or current treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene; 5) Previous eye disease, especially maculopathy; 6) Known heart failure (Grade III to IV of the New York Heart Association classification) or prolonged QTc; 7) Any type of cancer (except basal cell) in the last 5 years; 6) Refusal to give informed consent; 8) Evidence of any other unstable or clinically significant untreated immune, endocrine, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, neoplastic or psychiatric illness; 9) Antibodies positive for the human immunodeficiency virus; 10) Significant kidney or liver disease; 11) Pregnancy or lactation.Intervention and comparatorTwo groups will be analyzed with a 1: 1 randomization rate. Intervention: (n = 225): One 200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate coated tablet once daily for two months.Comparator (control group) (n = 225): One hydroxychloroquine placebo tablet (identical to that of the drug) once daily for two monthsMain outcomesThe primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate: number and percentage of healthcare personnel presenting symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (see ""Diagnosis of SARS CoV2 infection"" below) by the SARS-Cov2 virus during the study observation period (8 weeks) in both treatment arms;number and percentage of healthcare personnel in each group presenting with Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 >= 2) and number and percentage of healthcare personnel requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in both treatment arms.Diagnosis of SARS CoV2 infectionDetermination of IgA, IgM and IgG type antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Germany) every two weeks. In cases of seroconversion, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR will be performed to rule out / confirm an active infection (RT-PCR in One Step: RT performed with mastermix (Takara) and IDT probes, following protocol published and validated by the CDC Evaluation of COVID-19 in case of SARS-CoV-2 infectionRandomisationParticipants will be allocated to intervention and comparator groups according to a balanced randomization scheme (1: 1).

0	No SARS-CoV-2 carriage observed in children attending daycare centers during the intial weeks of the epidemic in Belgium. To gain knowledge about the role of young children attending daycare in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, a random sample of children (n = 84) aged between 6 and 30 months attending daycare in Belgium was studied shortly after the start of the epidemic (February 29th) and before the lockdown (March 18th) by performing in-house SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction. No asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas common cold symptoms were common (51.2%). Our study shows that in Belgium, there was no sign of early introduction into daycare centers at the moment children being not yet isolated at home, although the virus was clearly circulating. It is clear that more evidence is needed to understand the actual role of young children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and their infection risk when attending daycare.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Thrombin generation in severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the ICU. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by hypercoagulability with a high incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. Specifically, the role of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and of natural anticoagulants is still unknown. Moreover, identification of patients at high VTE-risk remains challenging. Aim(s): To investigate the specific roles of FVIII, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), and antithrombin (AT) in COVID-19 hypercoagulability. To assess the ability of thrombin generation (TG) assays to identify patients at high VTE-risk. Method(s): Retrospective single-center study performed at a tertiary care teaching hospital. We included 38 patients hospitalized in the ICU for severe COVID-19. Standard thromboprophylaxis (enoxaparine 40 mg once daily or unfractionated heparin 10000 UI/24 h) was recommended in all patients. TG was measured using the ST Genesia (Stago, Asnieres-sur- Seine, France) with and without thrombomodulin. Correlations between FVIII, PC/S, AT, and TG parameters were assessed (Pearson or Spearman). Comparisons between patients without and with VTE were made using Mann-Whitney test. Result(s): Among the 38 patients (21.1% females, median age 61 years), seven had a VTE. FVIII, proteins C/S, and AT did not differ between patients with or without VTE. Peak height and velocityindex of TG were significantly higher in patients with VTE compared to those without (Figure 1). FVIII levels correlated with peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), but not with velocity index (Table 1). PS correlated only with thrombomodulin-mediated TG-inhibition while PC and AT did not correlate with any TG-parameter (Table 1). Conclusion(s): FVIII, previously described as increased in severe COVID-19, seems to participate to the hypercoagulability in these patients. The natural anticoagulants do not seem to play an important role in this hypercoagulability. TG, in particular velocity index and peak eight, may help identifying patients at increased VTE-risk.	false
0	EPICOVID19: Psychometric assessment and validation of a short diagnostic scale for a rapid Covid-19 screening based on reported symptoms. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed cases have been registered in more than two hundred countries and, of July 28, over 16 million cases have been reported to WHO. The present study was conducted while the epidemic peak of COVID-19 was occurring in Italy. The early recognition is critical for the identification of suspected cases to be immediately subjected to quarantine. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the population so far., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the capability of self-reported symptoms to discriminate the COVID-19, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements. We defined and validated a method for the identification of a cut-off score., METHODS: Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 Italian national survey, launched in April 2020 including a convenience sample of 201121 adults, who filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The Phase II questionnaire, focused on results for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and/or serological tests, was mailed to all subjects who previously underwent NPS tests., RESULTS: Of 2703 subjects who completed the Phase II questionnaire, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+). In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) test and 421 who did Immunoglobulin-M (IgM) test, 22.9% (108 out of 472) and 11.6% (49 out of 421) tested positive, respectively. Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; P<.001), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; P<.001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9%]; P<.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8%]; P<.001) and Pain in muscles/bones/joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5%]; P<.001). Analysis of COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items revealed the presence of a one-factor solution, i.e. the EPICOVID19 diagnostic scale. The optimal score was identified: Respiratory problems (1.03), Chest pain (1.07), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (0.97) and Tachycardia (palpitations) (1.05) were the most important symptoms. On the adults aged 18-84 years the cut-off score was 2.56 (Se 76.56%; Sp 68.24%) in NPS(+) and 2.59 (Se 80.37; Sp 80.17) in IgG(+) subjects. On the >=60 years group the cut-off score was 1.28 and the accuracy detected by Antibodies IgG(+) was improved (Se 88.00; Sp 89.58)., CONCLUSIONS: We developed a short diagnostic scale to detect subjects with symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 among a wide population, which supports the potential for identifying individuals who need to seek immediate clinical evaluation. Although these results are referred to the Italian pandemic period, this short diagnostic scale could be optimised and tested as a screening tool in other similar pandemic contexts.	false
0	Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-from-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use during the COVID-19 Stay-at-home Period: A Prospective Study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive Internet use amidst this unusual health crisis., OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period, and to test three hypothesized risk-reduction or risk-elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects., METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 U.K. and 474 U.S. adult residents at two assessment points two months apart., RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 36% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 33%-39%) at Time 1 and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 25%-30%) at Time 2. The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support., CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the two-month study period was high among the U.K. and U.S. residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	YouTube Videos of the SARS-CoV-2 Nasopharyngeal Swab Technique: Content Analysis. BACKGROUND: Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is currently the most widely used method for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, false negatives and the sensitivity of this mode of testing have been problematic for accurately estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates., OBJECTIVE: Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether technical and, therefore, correctable errors were being made with regards to nasopharyngeal swab procedure., METHODS: Methods: Online video database (YouTube) was queried for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Videos were rated by three blinded rhinologists for accuracy of swab angle and depth. The overall score respectively for swab angle and swab depth for each NPS video was determined by the majority score with agreement among at least two out of three reviewers. Video data between YouTube videos with correct NPS technique and videos with incorrect NPS technique were compared. Multiple linear regression analysis with statistical significance set at P=0.05 was used to determine video data variables associated with correct NPS technique., RESULTS: Results: 126 videos met inclusion and exclusion criteria. 52% (N=66) of total NPS videos were determined to have correct angle while 46% (N=58) showed appropriate depth. 44% (N=57) of videos had both correct NPS angle and appropriate depth while 48% (N=59) of videos had both incorrect NPS angle and inappropriate depth. Videos with correct NPS technique were associated with the swab operator identifying as a medical professional and as an ENT-related medical professional. Correct NPS technique was also associated with more recent video publication date relative to May 15, 2020., CONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Greater attention needs to be given towards educating frontline healthcare workers performing NPS, as this study shows that over half of videos documenting NPS show incorrect technique, which could elevate false negative rates.	false
0	"Burnout Syndrome Among Hospital Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Civil War: A Cross-Sectional Study. Objective: We aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among hospital healthcare workers in Libya during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and civil war. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 18 to May 2, 2020 among Libyan healthcare workers. Data on participant characteristics were collected with a specifically designed questionnaire. Burnout was assessed with the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) comprising three subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA), with each sub-scale score range from 0 to 18. For EE and DP, scores of 10 to 18 were regarded as ""moderate to severe burnout."" PA was scored inversely, where a score <= 10 indicated severe burnout. Results: The study yielded a sample size of 532 participants. Of these, 357 (67.1%) reported emotional exhaustion (EE Score >= 10), 252 (47.4%) reported depersonalization (DP score >= 10), and 121 (22.7%) reported a lower sense of personal accomplishment (PA score <= 10). Verbal abuse was experienced by 304 participants (57.1%) and physical abuse in 93 (17.5). Gender was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. Being 35 years or older was associated with high depersonalization. Professional specialty was significantly associated with high emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Fear of COVID-19 infection was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. Conclusion:  The rising prevalence of mental disorders and inadequate availability of health services facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war demonstrated the need for healthcare policies to address the well-being of healthcare workers to decrease the risk of loss, suicide, and medical negligence.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection serology validation of different methods: Usefulness of IgA in the early phase of infection. In the late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. A novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory samples of patients with pneumonia as showed by the sequence analysis of the virus genomes obtained; The novel coronavirus was named SARSCoV-2. Reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) is the method of choice for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the high sensitive of the real-time PCR tests, sometimes samples from the upper respiratory tract may result negative even in the presence of radiological findings of pneumonia probably due to the viral load in the upper respiratory tract is low compared to the lower respiratory tract; low quality of the collected sample or technical reasons linked to the assay used. The use of serological assays may help in making diagnosis. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies, for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. In this work, we tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay, two ELISA assays and an ECLIA assay. Among the platforms assessed in this study, the ECLIA serological assay performed best, and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. Taken together, if a reflex test could be set in the laboratory, the ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.	false
0	6-month SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistency in a Tyrolian COVID-19 cohort. BACKGROUND: As coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 evolved only recently, the persistency of the anti-viral antibody response remains to be determined., METHODS: We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases, mean age 44+/- 13.2 years. Except for one participant with a pre-existing diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, all other participants were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2-10 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies at 6 months. Two binding antibody assays were used, targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain., RESULTS: All participants fully recovered spontaneously except for one who had persisting hyposmia. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain persisted for 6 months in all cases with a slight increase of titers, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below the cut-off point in 2 participants and showed a minimal decrease on average, mainly at month 3 of follow-up in males; however, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all samples at 6 months of follow-up., CONCLUSION: There is a stable and persisting antibody response against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at 6 months after infection. Neutralizing antibodies confirm virus specificity. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent cases is increasing sharply, antibody testing should be implemented to identify immunized individuals. This information can be helpful in various settings of professional and private life.	false
0	Covid-19 infection presenting with only gastrointestinal symptoms. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has currently spread to approximately 188 countries with current estimates of over 427,000 fatalities worldwide. It largely presents with respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are not common leading to delayed diagnosis. We present a case of an obese young man with no past medical history presenting with GI symptoms who was found to be COVID-19 positive. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 32-year-old obese male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with persistent nausea with nonbloody emesis, diarrhea, vague abdominal pain, and fever. He reported that a coworker had recently tested positive for COVID19. Significant labs on admission included AST 67 U/L, ALT 67 U/L, D-dimer 708.5 ng/ml, CRP 3.4 mg/ dL, LDH 341 U/L, ferritin 1,781 ng/mL, procalcitonin<0.05 ng/mL. Lipase was normal. Chest X-ray without acute pathology. Chest CT with contrast revealed nonspecific bilateral pneumonitis. Abdominal US revealed hepatic steatosis. With conservative measures including fluid resuscitation, patient's symptoms improved and he was discharged home to self-quarantine. DISCUSSION: It appears that COVID-19-related GI symptoms are due to the virus entering target cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is found throughout the digestive tract. This receptor is found at nearly 100-fold the amount in the GI tract as compared to the respiratory system. In a retrospective study of 206 patients with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China, it was found that those with GI symptoms demonstrated a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance. Additionally, it was found that such patients are more likely to have positive results on fecal testing as compared to those with predominantly respiratory symptoms. Those with both upper and lower digestive symptoms were more likely to present with fever as opposed to either alone which can delay timely diagnosis. In a meta-analysis of data from 29 COVID-19 studies with GI symptoms, prevalence was 15% and about 10% of patients presented with GI symptoms alone with the most common symptoms being nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. We live in unprecedented times, and should be wholly aware that COVID-19 infections can also present predominantly with gastrointestinal symptoms as delayed diagnosis is a major driver of this current COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Prevalence of COVID-19 Infection among Patients Presenting for Elective Outpatient Endoscopy in an Integrated Healthcare Network. INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, hospitals temporarily halted non-urgent surgeries and procedures due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) global pandemic. By mid-April, several gastroenterology societies published guidelines regarding safe resumption of elective endoscopy, including a recommendation for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing 48 hours pre-endoscopy. We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among adults presenting for routine outpatient endoscopy at a large, academic health center in order to establish whether new policies are needed to ensure patient and healthcare provider safety. METHOD(S): We used electronic health record data to identify all patients scheduled for an outpatient endoscopic procedure (EGD, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, EUS, or ERCP) at any of 5 UCLA Health endoscopy units between April 13, 2020 (testing policy implementation) and May 17, 2020 who completed a COVID-19 test as part of the screening protocol. We performed a manual chart review to collect data on patient demographics and clinical factors. The primary outcome was the COVID-19 test result. We also collected data on presence of COVID-19 symptoms pre-procedure and 6-14 days post-procedure. RESULT(S): The cohort included 550 patients (Table 1). Mean age was 56.1, 49.6% were male, 57.5% were non-Hispanic white, and 99.5% had health insurance coverage. There were 0 (0%) positive, 549 (99.8%) negative, and 1 (0.2%) inconclusive COVID-19 test results. There were 112 (20.4%) patients with symptoms possibly consistent with COVID-19 at the time of testing (Figure 1A). Fifty-three (9.6%) had symptoms possibly consistent with COVID-19 6-14 days after initial testing (Figure 1B). There were 63 patients (11.5%) tested again for COVID-19 at some point after initial endoscopy; none had positive results. Of note, the estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in Los Angeles County was 4.65% during the study period. CONCLUSION(S): In the first month of our pre-endoscopy COVID-19 testing program, no patients presenting for routine outpatient endoscopy were positive for COVID-19. There were also no positive COVID-19 results for patients who developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 6-14 days after endoscopy. These results may reflect a selection bias as providers may be less likely to refer patients for endoscopy when there are concerns for COVID-19. Nonetheless, the results reflect a low prevalence of COVID-19 in a large patient population and increase confidence about endoscopy utilization at this time.	false
0	COVID-19 in a patient on dual biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. INTRODUCTION: Preliminary data suggest that dual biologic therapy might be effective and safe in a subgroup of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, the safety and outcomes of dual biologic therapy in IBD with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is unknown. Here, we present a case of a Crohn's disease (CD) patient on adalimumab (ADA) and ustekinumab (UST) combination therapy who developed COVID-19. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: This is a 24-year-old man with fibrostenotic Crohn's ileocolitis diagnosed at age 9. He had a secondary loss of response to infliximab despite dose escalation to 10 mg/kg in combination with methotrexate (MTX). He was then transitioned to ADA and dose was escalated to 40 mg weekly with MTX (subsequently self-discontinued MTX). He achieved clinical response but not remission with ADA. Magnetic resonance enterography showed active inflammation in the terminal ileum, distal sigmoid colon, and rectum (Image 1). A colonoscopy showed ulcerated and polypoid mucosa in the terminal ileum and at the ileocecal valve with narrowing and patchy, mild pan-colonic inflammation (Image 2A/B). ADA level was 17 mcg/mL without antibodies. Switching to a different biologic was recommended. The patient was hesitant about discontinuing ADA due to symptomatic improvement. After discussion of risks and benefits, it was decided to bridge with UST and continue ADA with a plan to eventually discontinue ADA if remission was achieved. He received standard intravenous UST loading followed by 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Five months later, he tested positive for COVID-19 due to exposure to an infected individual. He was asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint and his gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were at baseline. He received a dose of UST 1 day prior to COVID-19 testing and last ADA was 1 week prior to testing. ADA was held and resumed 2 weeks after as he remained without fever, respiratory symptoms or new onset GI symptoms at 2 and 6 weeks after testing positive for COVID-19. DISCUSSION: This case describes a favorable outcome of a CD patient who tested positive for COVID-19 while on ADA and UST. Multiple series have demonstrated that biologic monotherapy is not associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 infected IBD patients. Instead, corticosteroids, advanced age and co-morbidities are predictors of adverse outcomes. However, more data is needed on the safety of combination biologic therapy in the COVID-19 era.	false
0	Neurotropism of human coronavirus 229E. The 299E prototype strain of human coronavirus (HCV-229E) has so far been mainly associated with infections of the respiratory tract. In the present study, we show evidence for infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by HCV-229E, both in vitro and in vivo. Various human cell lines of CNS origin were tested for their susceptibility to infection by HCV-229E. Production of viral antigens was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and infectious progeny virions by plaque assay on the L132 human embryonic lung cell line. The SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and H4 neuroglioma cell lines were highly susceptible to infection. The U-87 MG and U-373 MG astrocytoma cell lines were also infectable by HCV-229E. We could also demonstrate infection of the MO3.13 cell line, which was established by fusion of human oligodendrocytes with a thioguanine-resistant mutant of the TE671 (RD) human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. An apparently more extensive infection of the MO3.13 cells, when compared to the parental cells, supports the notion that human oligodendrocytes are differentially susceptible to infection by this virus. We also tested for HCV-229E gene expression in pathological brain specimens. For that purpose, we developed a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to amplify a portion of the mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein. Using stringent laboratory conditions, viral RNA was detectable in brain tissue of 4 of 11 multiple sclerosis patients and none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. These results strongly suggest neurotropism on the part of HCV-229E and emphasize the importance of further studies on the possible involvement of human coronaviruses in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.	false
0	Type I Interferon Signature in Chilblain-Like Lesions Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Contemporarily to the new SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in patients with acral chilblain lesions has been described. They manifest late after mild disease or asymptomatic exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Their pathogenic evolution is currently unknown. In biopsies from three patients with acral partially ulcerating chilblain lesions that occurred associated to the COVID-19 pandemic, we analysed the expression of type I interferon induced proteins and signal transduction kinases. Histology demonstrated perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and endothelial dominated MxA-staining, as well as pJAK1 activation. Our findings demonstrate induction of the type I IFN pathway in lesional sections of COVID-19-associated chilblain-like lesions. This may indicate a local antiviral immune activation status associated with preceding exposure to SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	In silico trial to test COVID-19 candidate vaccines: a case study with UISS platform. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a severe respiratory infection that infects humans. Its outburst entitled it as a pandemic emergence. To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects., RESULTS: We present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2., CONCLUSIONS: In silico trials are showing to be powerful weapons in predicting immune responses of potential candidate vaccines. Here, UISS has been extended to be used as an in silico trial platform to speed-up and drive the discovery pipeline of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.	false

Objetivo: Compreender os riscos residuais da transmissibilidade de doencas infecciosas por meio de transfusao saguinea. Material e metodos: Trata-se de uma revisao integrativa da literatura disponivel nas bases de dados PUBMED e MEDLINE, utilizando os descritores: ""Transfusao Sanguinea"", ""Transmissao""e ""Doencas"", devidamente cadastrados no MeSH, empregando o operador booleano AND. Foram avaliados 247 artigos e, ao fim, selecionados 20 para compor essa revisao. Os criterios de inclusao foram: artigos completos, disponibilizados de forma gratuita, publicados em ingles, entre os anos de 2012 a 2020. Bem como os criterios de exclusao foram: artigos nos demais idiomas, nao disponibilizados de forma gratuita e nos quais a tematica nao aborda o objetivo proposto. Resultados: A transfusao sanguinea e um metodo terapeutico amplamente utilizado, porem, mesmo com rigoroso controle de qualidade implementado nos bancos de sangue, ainda e possivel observar casos esporadicos de tranmissao de microrganismos ocasionando infeccoes transmitidas por transfusao (ITT). Os procedimentos entre a coleta de sangue do doador e a transfusao efeticamente no receptor, tem-se muitos metodos de avaliacao e controle de qualidade, os quais sao fundamentais para a garantia de uma correta e eficaz transfusao. Estes metodos somados aos avancos cientificos nas ultimas decadas na descoberta de agentes patogenicos e deteccao destes em material sanguineo como o virus da imunodeficiencia humana (HIV), virus da hepatite B (HBV), hepatite C (HCV) e virus da leucemia de celulas-T humanas (HTLV), proporcionam uma elevada seguranca ao paciente. Discussao: Apesar de rigorosos padroes de qualidade, ha cerca de 22 anos teve-se uma progressiva conscientizacao relacionada a seguranca das transfusoes sanguineas principalmente sobre doencas infecciosas emergentes. Um estudo realizado em 2017 demonstra que no ultimo (ate o momento de publicacao) e maior surto do virus ZIKV, foi relatado muitos casos provaveis de transmissao por transfusao sanguinea apesar do controle laboratorial. De acordo com a literautra, em um numero amostral de 129 pacientes infectados por ITT os virus de maior prevalencia foram o HCV, HBV e HIV, respectivamente. Mesmo que tenha sido confirmado a transmissibilidade de pessoa a pessoa do causador da COVID-19, ainda nao se sabe se o virus SARS-CoV-2 e transmitido pela transfusao sanguinea, dessa forma e necessario que sejam realizados mais estudos relacionados a esta tematica, uma vez que portadores do virus na forma assintomatica podem realizar a doacao sanguinea. A literatura demonstra que e possivel encontrar RNA viral especifico no soro de pacientes com COVID-19. Ainda neste estudo, relata-se que um homem de 21 anos, portador de anemia aplastica muito grave, foi transfudido com uma bolsa de plaquetas de um individuo diagnosticado com COVID-19. O individuo transfundido testou negativo para COVID-19, caracterizando que a doacao sanguinea e uma via inexplorada de transmissao. Conclusao: Contudo, fica claro que a transmissibilidade de doencas infecciosas por transfusao sanguinea ocorre, e com isso se faz necessario a utilizacao/criacao de tecnologias avancadas na triagem sanguinea capazes de rastrear estes microrganismos patogenicos, para assim minimizar suas transmissoes.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Serum-soluble ST2 as a novel biomarker reflecting inflammatory status and illness severity in patients with COVID-19. Aim: The authors studied the role of soluble ST2 (sST2) in COVID-19 and its relationship with inflammatory status and disease severity. Materials & methods: Serum levels of sST2 and interleukin (IL)-33, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein (SAA), IL-6 and procalcitonin (PCT), and T lymphocyte subsets from 80 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 including 36 mild, 41 severe and three asymptomatic cases were tested. Results: Serum sST2 levels were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients, which were positively correlated with CRP, but negatively correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts. Serum sST2 levels in nonsurviving severe cases were persistently high during disease progression. Conclusion:  Serum sST2 level test is helpful for reflecting inflammatory status and illness severity of COVID-19.	false
0	A Study on Domination in Vague Incidence Graph and Its Application in Medical Sciences. Fuzzy graphs (FGs), broadly known as fuzzy incidence graphs (FIGs), have been acknowledged as being an applicable and well-organized tool to epitomize and solve many multifarious real-world problems in which vague data and information are essential. Owing to unpredictable and unspecified information being an integral component in real-life problems that are often uncertain, it is highly challenging for an expert to illustrate those problems through a fuzzy graph. Therefore, resolving the uncertainty accompanying the unpredictable and unspecified information of any real-world problem can be done by applying a vague incidence graph (VIG), based on which the FGs may not engender satisfactory results. Similarly, VIGs are outstandingly practical tools for analyzing different computer science domains such as networking, clustering, and also other issues such as medical sciences, and traffic planning. Dominating sets (DSs) enjoy practical interest in several areas. In wireless networking, DSs are being used to find efficient routes with ad-hoc mobile networks. They have also been employed in document summarization, and in secure systems designs for electrical grids; consequently, in this paper, we extend the concept of the FIG to the VIG, and show some of its important properties. In particular, we discuss the well-known problems of vague incidence dominating set, valid degree, isolated vertex, vague incidence irredundant set and their cardinalities related to the dominating, etc. Finally, a DS application for VIG to properly manage the COVID-19 testing facility is introduced.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and short-term prognosis of in-patients with diabetes and COVID-19: A retrospective study from an academic center in Belgium. Background and aims: We describe the characteristics and short-term prognosis of in-patients with diabetes and COVID-19 admitted to a Belgian academic care center. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the data on admission from patients with known or newly-diagnosed diabetes and confirmed COVID-19. First, survivors were compared to non-survivors to study the predictive factors of in-hospital death in patients with diabetes. Secondly, diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were matched for age and sex with non-diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, to study the prognosis and predictive factors of in-hospital death related to diabetes. Result(s): Seventy-three diabetic patients were included. Mean age was 69 (+/-14) years. Women accounted for 52%. Most patients had type 2 diabetes (89.0%), long-term complications of hyperglycemia (59.1%), and hypertension (80.8%). The case-fatality rate (CFR) was 15%. Non-survivors had more severe pneumonia based on imaging (p 0.029) and were less often treated with metformin (p 0.036). In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, CFR was 15.6% in diabetic (n = 64) and 25.0% in non-diabetic patients (n = 128), the difference being non-significant (p 0.194). Predictive factors of in-hospital death were elevated white blood cells count (HR 9.4, CI 1.50-58.8, p 0.016) and severe pneumonia on imaging (HR 25.0, CI 1.34-466, p 0.031) in diabetic patients, and cognitive impairment (HR 5.80, CI 1.61-20.9, p 0.007) and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.63, CI 1.54-20.6, p 0.009) in non-diabetic patients. Conclusion(s): In this monocentric cohort from Belgium, diabetic in-patients with COVID-19 had mostly type 2 diabetes, prevalent hyperglycemia-related vascular complications and comorbidities including hypertension. In this cohort, the CFR was not statistically different between patients with and without diabetes.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Gastric metastasis of invasive lobular breast carcinoma. INTRODUCTION: Malignancies metastasizing to the stomach are rare and occur during the late stages of malignancy. Primary malignancies associated with gastric metastases include melanoma, esophagus, lung, renal cell carcinoma and breast. Of patients with metastatic breast cancer, one review reported a 0.3% incidence rate.We report a patient with known metastatic breast cancer to the bone and healing gastric ulcers found to have biopsy-proven breast cancer metastasis to the stomach. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 74 year-old female with a past medical history of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast complicated by bone metastases presented to an outpatient clinic for hospital follow-up. Although originally presenting to the hospital secondary to hematemesis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings reported a pyloric ulcer with a bleeding vessel requiring epinephrine injections and heater probe cauterization. The ulcer was likely due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. She was discharged with a proton pump inhibitor twice daily with no further bleeding. Follow-up EGD reported ulcer healing; however, antral thickening was noted. Antral biopsies reported poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative staining for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2 whereas estrogen receptor staining reported nuclear positivity in the neoplastic cells with mammaglobin suggesting breast cancer as the primary source. She was continued on palliative chemotherapy with palbociclib, letrozole, and denosumab. Unfortunately, she suffered frequent admissions for recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage and eventually passed away due to complications of coronavirus disease 2019. DISCUSSION: Metastases to the stomach are a rare complication of breast cancer. Such etiologies could be considered in breast cancer patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Given her history of a gastric ulcer secondary to NSAID use, symptoms of hematemesis was attributed to gastric ulcers. However, gastric mucosal irregularities are not always obvious with metastatic lesions. Furthermore, up to 30% of cases may be missed due to metastatic spread to deep mucosal layers. Given this, in patients with a history of malignancy, suspicion for metastatic lesions should remain high especially if they have gastric mucosal irregularities. These should always be investigated with biopsies to prevent delays in management.	false
0	Decreased Incidence of Oncology Admissions in 75 Helios Hospitals in Germany during the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lead to a massive shutdown of social life in Germany starting in March 2020. Elective medical treatment was substantially reduced but urgent diagnostics and treatment including cancer care should not have been affected., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the number of oncology admissions to 75 German Helios hospitals during 2 time periods in 2020 and compared the data with the respective periods in 2019. The study included nearly 69,000 admissions in total., RESULTS: A highly significant reduction in overall cancer admissions was seen for the early lockdown period from 13 March to 28 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. After an official communication advising the health system to return to normal practice on 29 April 2020, we again found a highly significant difference in admissions compared to the respective time in the previous year. Subgroup analysis shows a significant impact of age >75 years, high hospital volume, and intermediate or high COVID-19 case volume in the federal states. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. The effects and significance levels were comparable in nearly all different diagnostic subgroups according to the ICD codes., CONCLUSIONS: For cancer diagnosis and treatment, we found a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions in the range of 10-20% for both study periods in comparison to the previous year.

0	Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 Pneumonia. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Despite the disproportionate incidence of Covid-19 among underserved and racial and ethnic minority populations, the safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients from these populations who are hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia are unclear., METHODS: We randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation to receive standard care plus one or two doses of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo. Site selection was focused on the inclusion of sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations. The primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death by day 28., RESULTS: A total of 389 patients underwent randomization, and the modified intention-to-treat population included 249 patients in the tocilizumab group and 128 patients in the placebo group; 56.0% were Hispanic or Latino, 14.9% were Black, 12.7% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 12.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 3.7% were of other or unknown race or ethnic group. The cumulative percentage of patients who had received mechanical ventilation or who had died by day 28 was 12.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5 to 16.9) in the tocilizumab group and 19.3% (95% CI, 13.3 to 27.4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for mechanical ventilation or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97; P = 0.04 by the log-rank test). Clinical failure as assessed in a time-to-event analysis favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93). Death from any cause by day 28 occurred in 10.4% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 8.6% of those in the placebo group (weighted difference, 2.0 percentage points; 95% CI, - 5.2 to 7.8). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 38 of 250 patients (15.2%) in the tocilizumab group and 25 of 127 patients (19.7%) in the placebo group., CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab reduced the likelihood of progression to the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death, but it did not improve survival. No new safety signals were identified. (Funded by Genentech; EMPACTA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04372186.). Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.	false

0	Low yield of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) testing prior to endoscopic procedures in a community-based gastroenterology practice. INTRODUCTION: The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopic utilization causing significant health and economic losses. Accordingly, gastroenterology (GI) societies recommended COVID-19 testing to screen all patients undergoing endoscopic procedures which resulted in a relatively increased access to such interventions. Nonetheless, this approach can be limited by the cost and availability of testing. We evaluated the feasibility and yield of this approach in detecting patients with COVID-19 at our community-based GI practice which is located in an area with a low COVID-19 prevalence of <1%. METHOD(S): This is a clinical, non-interventional, observation-based quality initiative of patients scheduled for endoscopic procedures at our community-based GI practice from May 11th to June 4th, 2020. All patients underwent symptoms screening, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing. Based on the testing result, a decision whether to proceed with endoscopic procedure or not was made. After the procedure, providers were followed closely to early detect any concerning symptoms. RESULT(S): A total of 285 patients were scheduled for endoscopic procedures during that time period, 270 were tested for COVID-19. Table 1 details patient baseline characteristics. None of the patients had a positive test result, with only one individual appearing symptomatic but later testing negative. The remaining 15 patients did not undergo their scheduled endoscopic procedure as they did not undergo the required COVID-19 testing prior to their procedure (Figure 1). None of the providers developed COVID-19 related symptoms after the endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Over a 1-month period, we observed a 0% positive test rate for COVID-19 at our GI practice. The results suggest that the current testing protocol may not be cost effective or add much to the safety of patients and providers in low prevalence areas. The most commonly used PCR test can have up to 48 hours turn-around time, which could potentially delay patient care and the overall efficiency of the practice. Therefore, preserving PCR testing to patients with high index of suspicion at GI practices with similar positive test rates as ours, may be a reasonable option in order to improve access to endoscopic procedures. Larger scale, multi-center studies are needed to corroborate these findings. In the interim, strict use of personal protective equipment during endoscopic procedures should continue to be strongly emphasized. (Figure Presented).	false
0	Tacrolimus-induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with seizures: A rare clinical combination. INTRODUCTION: Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is a backbone of many liver transplant antirejection regimens. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinical entity, with acute neurological symptoms and a classic MRI pattern. This case presents a recent liver transplant patient who developed PRES while on tacrolimus (TAC). CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 47-year-old woman s/p deceased donor liver transplant presented with 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Her OLT 7 weeks prior for NASH with MELDNa 28 required retransplant day 2 for primary nonfunction. Immunosuppression included Basiliximab day 1 and day 4 induction, Mycophenolate Mofetil 1gm BID, Prednisone taper, and TAC with goal levels maintained 8-10 ng/mL. One week before presentation, she had progressive headaches, unsteady gait, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Medications included unchanged doses of TAC 3 mg BID, prednisone 15 mg daily, TMP/SMX, 81mg ASA, and 20 mg omeprazole. She had 2 witnessed brief tonicclonic seizures, which responded to lorazepam and leviteracetam, and was empirically treated with antimicrobials. Neurology evaluation revealed BP 176/86 mmHg and a postictal state without focal findings, and an encephalopathic EEG without seizure. CT head was negative for hemorrhage. Labs earlier that day showed normal CBC, INR, chemistry panel including renal and liver function except a glucose of 465mg/dL. Negative studies included: full respiratory viral panel including COVID-19, serum cryptococcus antigen and CMV PCR, UA, a LP with normal opening pressure and cell counts, and broad encephalitis PCR panels. TAC trough was 13.7 ng/mL. MRI revealed patchy focal T2- hyperintensities in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and occipital lobes, consistent with PRES. DISCUSSION: PRES occurs in ,1% of liver transplants, characterized by a typical brain edema pattern. Hypertension, encephalopathy, and seizures are frequent often without a seizure history. Of the few reports associating PRES with TAC, trough levels were not supratherapeutic. Presentation ranges days to months after drug initiation, with a more delayed PRES from TAC than cyclosporine at 26 vs. 12 days. MRI findings do not correlate with severity. The pathophysiology is unknown but may include blood-brain barrier damage and abnormal vascular autoregulation. Early recognition is key as management includes TAC discontinuation and aggressive blood pressure management. Most patients, including ours, have no major neurological sequelae if diagnosed and treated quickly.	false
0	COVID-19-associated atypical acute pancreatitis!!. INTRODUCTION: The clinical presentation of pancreatitis in the course of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is not well understood. The etiology may be a direct cytopathic effect mediated by local SARS-CoV-2 replication versus an injury caused by the cytokine release induced by the infection. We present 2 cases of COVID-19-associated pancreatitis. Both had severe multi-organ failure requiring ventilator and dialysis support. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: Case 1: 57 year old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension presented with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Leukocytes were 14.6 K/uL and C-reactive protein was 897 g/L, AST was 98 IU/L, ALT was135 IU/L, and INR was 13. Serum amylase and lipase levels were 398 IU/L and 2726 IU/L, respectively. Triglyceride level was179 mg/dL. He had no alcohol use and viral hepatitis panel and urine drug scree were all negative. After extubation, he ate well with minimal symptoms despite lipase levels peaking at 3,369 IU/L on day 11 and declined only to peak again on day 20 to 4,620 IU/L. C-reactive protein remained under 10 g/L during the first peak and began to climb only with the second peak. He was discharged on day 23 with lipase declining to 2,856 IU/L while asymptomatic and off dialysis. Case 2: 70 year old man was admitted with PCR confirmed COVID19 systemic infection requiring mechanical ventilation. Two weeks after extubation, he developed mild abdominal pain and anorexia that promptly resolved but his lipase level was found to be 1,874 IU/L. This continued to fluctuate mildly down to 1,247 IU/L over 10 days despite lack of symptoms. DISCUSSION: Viral pancreatitis has been reported with Coxsackie virus, CMV, HIV, HSV, mumps, VZV, among others. We describe pancreatitis associated with COVID-19 that may be related to direct viral invasion. Both persons had conspicuously absent symptoms despite substantial elevations of lipase levels. In both, the amylase paralleled the lipase levels trending while but there was no correlation between these enzyme levels and those of C-reactive protein making cytokine release less probable as an etiology.	false
0	Abnormal liver function tests in patients presenting with covid-19. INTRODUCTION: Recent studies from China reported have reported various rates of abnormal liver function tests in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. However, data from the United States is limited. We sought to evaluate abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs) in patients presenting with COVID-19 in the United States and compared them to a control group of hospitalized patients tested negative for COVID-19. METHOD(S): Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at our institution between January and March of 2020 were included. Patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 but tested negative served as controls. Information regarding patient demographics and laboratory values was recorded. RESULT(S): A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 and 131 were controls were included. There was no difference between COVID-19 patients and controls in age (67.4 years versus 67.8 years, P=0.8) or gender (female: 46% versus 59.4%, P=0.5). Upon presentation, LFTs were abnormal in 44.9% of COVID patients compared to 35.8% controls (P=0.12) There was no difference in the proportion of patients with elevated total bilirubin and international normalized ratio (INR) among COVID patients and controls. A higher proportion of COVID patients than controls had abnormal serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (27.9% versus 16.5%, P=0.02) and serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels (41.8% versus 22.1%, P<0.001). A lower proportion of COVID patients had abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (10% versus 22.7%, P=0.005) as compared to controls [Table 1]. Elevation in ALT and AST greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal was only seen in=COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION(S): Abnormal LFTs are common on presentation in COVID-19 patients. However, the liver injury is predominantly mild and hepatocellular. Synthetic liver dysfunction is uncommon in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Association of Search Engine Queries for COVID-19 and Diarrhea with COVID-19 Epidemiology. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a far-reaching pandemic that has changed the landscape of human interaction. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, are part of the spectrum of disease. Previous infectious disease studies have shown good correlation between online search engine queries and disease burden, thereby allowing tracking. We aimed to assess the relationship between Google searches for COVID-19 and diarrhea with COVID-19 epidemiology, including incidence and mortality. METHOD(S): Google Trends, a publicly available and free service that tracks online search frequency, was utilized to identify online searches for combined diarrhea plus COVID-19 from March 3, 2020 to May 4, 2020. These results were stratified by state and then compared with publicly reported incidence data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the same timeframe. A control search of other COVID-19 associated symptoms listed by the CDC was performed. Additional control searches of the individual search terms diarrhea and COVID-19 were conducted. Correlations between geographic location and epidemiologic trends were analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULT(S): State-by-state searches for COVID-19 plus diarrhea were correlated with mortality reported as deaths per capita (R = 0.31; P = 0.03) [Figure 1], but not incidence reported as cases per capita (R = 0.19; P = 0.19). New Hampshire had the highest number of COVID-19 plus diarrhea searches while Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, and West Virginia had the lowest relative search frequency. Diarrhea was the second most searched symptom in conjunction with COVID-19 [Figure 2]. Fever and cough, which are thought of as more traditional upper respiratory viral symptoms, were also commonly searched. Diarrhea alone was more frequently searched than COVID-19 alone or COVID-19 plus diarrhea [Figure 3]. CONCLUSION(S): Our data show weak correlation between mortality and COVID-19 searches. This indicates that, for COVID-19, online search analysis is unlikely to be a good substitute for more traditional methods of patient testing, case tracking, and early detection. However, Google Trends of searches for COVID-19 plus diarrhea, in addition to being a marker for disease interest, may still be useful as part of a more complex model for tracking disease as they parallel search activity for COVID-19 in general.	false
0	High Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients with Cancer. INTRODUCTION: Patients with COVID-19 most commonly present with fever, dry cough, myalgia, or fatigue; however, the disease may progress rapidly to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have also been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data on the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms in patients with cancer are limited. We sought to characterize the GI manifestations of COVID-19 in oncology patients. Method(s): We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 9 Massachusetts medical centers and identified those with an active malignancy. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, as well as their disease severity and clinical outcomes. Result(s): Of 395 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (9%) had an active malignancy. Of the 36 cancer patients, 23 (63%) reported >=1 new GI symptom. The most prevalent symptoms were anorexia (12, 52%), diarrhea (9, 39%), and vomiting (8; 35%). GI symptoms were the initial symptom in 4 (11%) patients, the predominant symptom in 5 (14%) patients, and were severe in 4 (17%) patients. Four of 5 patients with GI symptoms at presentation reported concurrent fever, notably 1 patient had no fever or respiratory symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients had elevations in liver trans-aminases at presentation. Patients with elevated transaminases were more likely to have associated GI symptoms (83 vs 54%, P = 0.04) (Table 1). COVID-related GI symptoms were seen in 73% of patients on active treatment as compared with 52% of patients who were not on active treatment. However, these results were not statistically significant. There were no differences in the incidence of GI symptoms on COVID-19 based on the specific treatment modality (Table 2). Conclusion(s): Acute GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 are highly prevalent in hospitalized cancer patients and can occur as a presenting symptom without respiratory symptoms. Symptoms are severe in a small subset of patients. Fever was not a universal symptom in our cohort of cancer patients. Increased awareness of GI symptoms as a manifestation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer may provide opportunities for early identification and management.	false
0	New-onset postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome following coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We report a case of new-onset postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in an otherwise healthy female patient following COVID-19 infection. The patient presented with fatigue, orthostatic palpitations, dizziness, and presyncope. She underwent head-up tilt-table testing and the findings were suggestive of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.Copyright © 2020 Innovations in Cardiac Rhythm Management.	false
0	Clinical Findings of COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Units in Guangdong Province, China: A Multicenter, Retrospective, Observational Study. Background: Information about critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China but outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Method(s): In this multicenter, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to seven ICUs in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Result(s): A total of 45 COVID-19 patients required ICU admission in the study hospitals [mean age 56.7 +/- 15.4 years, 29 males (64.4%)]. The most common symptoms at onset were fever and cough. Most patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all patients. Thirty-six patients (80%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome at ICU admission, and 15 (33.3%) septic shock. Twenty patients (44.4%) were intubated, and 10 (22.2%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The 60-day mortality was 4.4% (2 of 45). Conclusion(s): COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction. The mortality of ICU patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low with a small sample size.© Copyright © 2020 Xu, Xu, Liu, Cai, Zheng, Huang, Zhou, Huang, Ling, Deng, Li, Chen, Liu, Lin, Zhou, He, Zhong, Liu and Li.	false
0	Comparison of Viral COVID-19 Sina Weibo and Twitter Contents: a Novel Feature Extraction and Analytical Workflow. BACKGROUND: Social media play a critical role in health communications especially during global health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of universal analytical framework to extract, quantify and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad socio-cultural spectrum., OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework, and contrast how content features differ with socio-cultural backgrounds in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms., METHODS: We sampled 1,000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (e.g., clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, political and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of online health communications., RESULTS: There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the same COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease and health aspects while Twitter users engaged more about policy, political, and other societal issues., CONCLUSIONS: We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse of COVID-19 in different social-cultural backgrounds. In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond COVID-19., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Effect of Artificial Liver Blood Purification Treatment on the Survival of Critical Ill COVID-19 Patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of artificial liver blood purification treatment on the survival of severe/critical patients with COVID-19., METHODS: A total of 101 severe and critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in this open, case-control, multicentre, prospective study. According to the patients' and their families' willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment, while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment. Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28-day mortality rate, were collected and analysed., RESULTS: This study involved 101 severe/critical patients with COVID-19, among which 50 were in the treatment group and 51 were in the control group. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre-treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices et al. showed no difference between the two groups. Cytokine storm was detected, with a significant increase of serum IL-6 level. The serum IL-6 level decreased from 119.94 pg/mL to 20.49 pg/mL in the treatment group and increased from 40.42 pg/mL to 50.81 pg/mL in the control group (p<0.05), indicating that artificial liver therapy significantly decreased serum IL-6. The median duration of viral nucleic acid persistence was 19 days in the treatment group (ranging from 6-67 days) and 17 days in the control group (ranging from 3-68 days), no significant difference was observed (p=0.36). As of 28-day follow-up,17 patients in the treatment group experienced a median weaning time of 24 days, while 11 patients in the control group experienced a median weaning time of 35 days, with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.33). The 28-day mortality rates were 16% (8/50) in the treatment group and 50.98% (26/51) in the control group, with a significant difference (z=3.70, p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Cytokine storm is a key factor in the intensification of COVID-19 pneumonia. The artificial liver therapy blocks the cytokine storm by clearing inflammatory mediators, thus preventing severe cases from progressing to critically ill stages and markedly reducing short-term mortality.

0	Prevalence of abnormal liver chemistries at initial presentation of COVID-19 infection in patients without known chronic liver disease. INTRODUCTION: Abnormal liver enzymes have been noted as a result of infection by the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). This study examines the prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes at initial presentation in COVID-19 patients without known underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). METHOD(S): We reviewed charts of 11,265 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to any of 12 hospitals in our health system from March 1 to April 30, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swabbing for PCR. Labs drawn within 24 hours of presentation were considered baseline. Patients that had an age less than 18, CLD-related ICD-10 codes, or missing baseline data were excluded. Abnormalities in liver chemistries were grouped as follows: (1) within normal limits; (2) mild: greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) to less than or equal to 4 times the ULN; (3) moderate: greater than 4 times the ULN to less than or equal to 10 times the ULN; and (4) severe: greater than 10 times the ULN. Those with significant liver chemistry abnormalities were also grouped into patterns of injury based on ALT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP): hepatocellular (ALT >3x ULN and ALP <=2x ULN), cholestatic (ALP >2x ULN and ALT <=3x ULN), or mixed (ALT >3x ULN and ALP >2x ULN). RESULT(S): 10,614 patients were included in our study. Over half of patients had elevations in AST (59%) and ALT (54%) on presentation, whereas ALP and total bilirubin were elevated in 13% and 5% of patients, respectively. The majority of patients had mild AST and ALT elevations as defined above (49% and 54%, respectively). Moderate elevations of AST (4.6%) and ALT (4.1%) were less common. Severe elevations in AST and ALT were seen in 0.8% of patients. 99% of ALP and total bilirubin elevations were mild. 3 patients presented with a total bilirubin greater than 10 X ULN. 936 patients (8.9%) presented with a hepatocellular pattern, 133 patients (1.3%) with a cholestatic pattern, and 91 patients (0.9%) with a mixed pattern. CONCLUSION(S): The majority of patients without known CLD presenting to the hospital with COVID-19 infection have abnormal liver chemistries. Most liver test abnormalities are mild with AST and ALT elevations more frequent than elevations in ALP and total bilirubin. The predominant pattern of liver injury was hepatocellular. Severe elevations of any biochemical liver tests are uncommon. The pathophysiology of these elevations need to be further studied to determine their etiology and whether certain enzyme patterns predict outcome.	false
0	Pre-Procedure COVID-19 Screening and SARS-CoV-2 Testing in a Large Community-Based Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) in SE Michigan. INTRODUCTION: The role of pre-procedure COVID-19 testing in outpatient endoscopy centers remains unclear, especially in areas with declining incidence and prevalence of infection. We developed a strategy utilizing symptom screening and SARS-CoV-2 viral RT-PCR testing in patients referred for elective endoscopy at a large community-based ASC in SE Michigan. We hypothesize that this dual screening approach will allow better detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of all patients referred for elective outpatient endoscopy during a 3 week period (May 20-June 12, 2020) was conducted. Patients were initially screened for exposure history and symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of procedure scheduling, again 3 days prior to the procedure, and on the actual day of the procedure. All patients were offered SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing 48 hours prior to the scheduled procedure and then advised to follow CDC guidelines of social distancing, donning a face mask and frequent hand hygiene until endoscopy. Uptake of COVID-19 testing, barriers, and impact on subsequent endoscopy were evaluated. RESULT(S): 718 consecutive patients were scheduled for elective outpatient endoscopy. All patients were symptom screened and 642 patients (89%) underwent COVID-19 PCR testing within 48 hours of their scheduled procedures. 2 patients reported fevers within 48 hours of their scheduled endos-copy, leading to cancellation. COVID-19 PCR testing of asymptomatic patients (n = 642) revealed no positive results. A total of 76 patients (11%) did not undergo viral testing. Barriers to COVID-19 testing included limited time interval between scheduling and procedure, patient reported challenges with travel/availability, and negative perceptions about testing. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the feasibility and successful implementation of a preprocedure COVID-19 screening program in a busy endoscopy center. The dual process of clinical screening for symptomatic patients and viral testing of asymptomatic patients optimizes the likelihood of identifying pre-procedure patients with COVID-19. Although there is a low yield of positive viral tests in settings with low disease prevalence, this study forms a framework to expand preprocedure screening and testing to enhance safety for our patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Criticism of the sentinel model of epidemiological surveillance in COVID-19. Objective: To analyze the increase in sentinel cases of COVID-19 in Mexico calculated from the effective number of reproductions of the infection (Rt) and compare its evolution with that reported by Italy, Spain and the United States of America during the first twenty weeks of evolution of the epidemic. Method(s): In an analytical cross-sectional design, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Mexico from February 29 to July 24, 2020 was studied, and compared with sentinel cases calculated from the Rt. A descriptive and comparative analysis of prevalence, cumulative incidence and case fatality was performed to summarize the epidemiological data for Mexico and in relation to information for Italy, Spain, and the United States of North America. Result(s): In Mexico, until July 24, 2020, there are a total of 390,516 cases of COVID-19 and 43,680 deaths from this disease; with the use of Rt to calculate the correction of cases and unidentified deaths, the figure increases to 3,780,195 cases (p = 0.0002) and 211,469 deaths (p = 0.001). This suggests underreporting in the identification of cases and deaths and isCopyright © 2020 Academia Mexicana de Cirugia.	false
0	ANTICOAGULACAO PROFILATICA DURANTE A INTERNACAO HOSPITALAR NA COVID-19: REVISAO DE LITERATURA. Objetivo: Analisar as diversas recomendacoes e evidencias sobre o manejo da anticoagulacao nos pacientes COVID-19 durante a internacao,dando enfase ao seu uso profilatico. Materiais e metodos: Trata-se de um estudo narrativo, do tipo revisao de literatura, baseado em pesquisa bibliografica realizada nas bases de dados PubMed, MEDLINE, Scielo e Up to Date, sendo incluidos artigos publicados entre marco/20 a julho/20. Os Descritores em Ciencias da Saude (DECS) foram: anticoagulacao, COVID-19, profilaxia, tromboembolismo. Resultados e revisao de literatura: Embora nao haja consenso entre as recomendacoes, haja vista se basearem em estudos iniciais e orientacoes de especialistas, ja se apresentam convergencias entre elas, destacando-se a indicacao de anticoagulacao profilatica para todos os pacientes hospitalizados por suspeita ou confirmacao de COVID-19, na ausencia de contraindicacoes absolutas. E, alem disso, a preferencia pela escolha de Heparina de Baixo Peso Molecular (HBPM) em pacientes estaveis e com depuracao normal de creatinina (Cr), devido a sua comodidade posologica. De maneira alternativa, pode-se fazer uso de heparina nao fracionada (HNF) ou fondaparinux,dando-se prioridade a HNF em caso de choque ou depuracao de Cr abaixo de 50 mL/min/m2. Entretanto, algumas sociedades medicas defendem o uso de uma profilaxia diferenciada para pacientes com COVID-19 em ambiente de cuidados intensivos (UTI/UCI), com doses semelhantes ao usado na anticoagulacao (AC) intermediaria ou terapeutica para TEV. Outros, ainda, tem orientado nao so a AC profilatica diferenciada nos pacientes de UTI com COVID-19, como tambem a sua ampliacao para aqueles que apresentam algum sinal de gravidade, tais como FR > 24 irpm, SatO2 < 90%, PCR elevada, niveis de D-dimero e fibrinogenio elevados ou em ascensao, chegando a ajustar as dosagens de acordo com alguns indicadores laboratoriais (ex: D-dimero). Discussao: A anticoagulacao, sob o crivo da analise de estudos e de relatos de caso, se mostrou uma das bases fundamentais no manejo do paciente hospitalizado por COVID-19, pela alta frequencia de eventos tromboembolicos apresentados nessa populacao, e a constatacao de microtromboses no estudo post-mortem em alguns trabalhos. Nesse sentido, mesmo com a anticoagulacao profilatica, houve uma incidencia de complicacoes tromboticas superior em comparacao com pacientes portadores de outras patologias, sob os mesmos cuidados intensivos (duplicando a prevalencia de TEV em algumas analises). Por isso, surgiu a indicacao empirica de elevacao da dose profilatica, para assegurar maior protecao ao paciente, embora ja tenham sido observados eventos dessa natureza com a dose amplificada, e ainda ha carencia de evidencias mais robustas de sua efetividade. Conclusao: Grande parte dos pacientes graves ja estao naturalmente sujeitos a maior risco de TEV por causas multifatoriais, mas o COVID-19 tem se destacado por uma trombogenese mais acentuada. Nessa perspectiva, a literatura tem relatado que, na maioria dos pacientes estudados, nao tem sido possivel abortar a alta incidencia dessas complicacoes apenas com a anticoagulacao profilatica basica, devendo-se buscar evidencias que sustentem o emprego seguro de novos padroes de anticoagulacao,com vistas a uma melhor prevencao primaria desse perfil de paciente.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 Mortality in an area of northeast brazil: Epidemiological characteristics and prospective spatiotemporal modeling. This study aimed to analyse the spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe, Northeast, Brazil. It was an ecological study utilising spatiotemporal analysis techniques that included all deaths confirmed by COVID-19 in Sergipe, from 2 April to 14 June 2020. Mortality rates were calculated per 100000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority among >= 60 years old (62%) and males (53%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). Observed was an increasing mortality trend across the state, with a higher increase in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside. Therefore, the use of spatial analysis techniques may contribute to surveillance and control of COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	FATORES PREDITORES DE PERMANENCIA EM UTI EM PACIENTES COM COVID-19 TRATADOS COM PLASMA CONVALESCENTE. Objetivos: Ate o momento, nenhuma droga se mostrou efetiva no tratamento da COVID-19. O uso de plasma coletado de doadores convalescentes pode ser uma alternativa terapeutica nos casos de formas graves da doenca. Analisamos uma serie de casos de pacientes criticos com COVID-19 tratados com plasma convalescente, a fim de definir fatores preditores de tempo de permanencia em unidades de terapia intensiva (UTI). Materiais e metodos: Cinquenta e sete pacientes com diagnostico de COVID-19 confirmado por RT-PCR e pneumonia grave foram recrutados em UTI's em tres hospitais terciarios no Brasil. Doses de 200 a 600 ml de plasma convalescente foram administradas. As seguintes variaveis foram analisadas a fim de definir preditores de tempo de internacao em UTI: titulos de anticorpos neutralizantes dos pacientes antes da transfusao (NAbsP), titulos de anticorpos neutralizantes das unidades de plasma transfundidas (NAbsT), grupo ABO dos pacientes, escore Severity organ failure assessment (SOFA) no Dia 0 (dia da administracao do plasma), uso de quaisquer outras terapeuticas (hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina, tocilizumab, imunoglobulina) e presenca de comorbidades. A analise estatistica foi feita com modelos multivariados considerando-se nivel de significancia de 5%, utilizando o software SPSS. Resultados e discussao: NAbs T, uso de outras terapeuticas (hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina, tocilizumab, imunoglobulina), grupo ABO e comorbidades sao preditores de tempo de permanencia em UTI. Altos titulo de anticorpos neutralizantes dos produtos transfundidos e o uso de outras terapeuticas foram associados a reducao nos tempos de permanencia em UTI. Observou-se que quanto maior o titulo de NAbsT, menor o tempo de permanencia em UTI. O acrescimo de uma unidade no titulo de neutralizantes por ml de plasma transfundido resulta em reducao de 6,9% no tempo de permanencia em UTI (Mean ratio - MR= 0,931, 95% IC 0,907-0,956; p<0,001). O uso de outras terapeuticas tambem resultou em menores tempos de permanencia em UTI (MR=0,650; 95% IC 0,480-0,879; p=0,005). Por outro lado, a presenca de comorbidades (MR=3,438; 95% IC 1,296-9,123; p=0.013), os grupos sanguineos A e AB quando comparados a pacientes B e O foram associados a maiores tempos de permanencia em UTI (MR=1.298; 95% IC 1,136-1,483; p<0,001). NAbsP e SOFA no D0 nao tiveram impacto nos tempos de internacao em UTI. Conclusao: Apesar das limitacoes de um estudo nao controlado, nossas analises revelam dados interessantes acerca dos pacientes com COVID-19 tratados com plasma convalescente Transfusao de plasma convalescente de altos titulos parece reduzir o tempo de permanencia em UTI. Por outro lado, o titulo dos anticorpos neutralizantes produzidos pelos proprios pacientes nao teve impacto no tempo de internacao em UTI. Pacientes com grupos sanguineos A e AB e com comorbidades estao associados a maiores tempos de internacao em UTI. Sao necessarios mais estudos a fim de confirmar tais achados.Copyright © 2020	false
0	ASPECTOS CLINICOS DA COVID-19 EM PACIENTES COM ANEMIA FALCIFORME DO CENTRO DE HEMOTERAPIA E HEMATOLOGIA DO ESPIRITO SANTO. Objetivos: Relatar os aspectos clinicos de quatro pacientes com anemia falciforme com diagnostico da COVID-19 acompanhados no ambulatorio do HEMOES. Material e metodos: Foi realizado um levantamento dos dados de prontuario, resumo de alta hospitalar e entrevista clinica nos pacientes com doenca falciforme que desenvolveram COVID-19. Resultados: De um total de 338 pacientes acompanhados no ambulatorio, 1% apresentou diagnostico da COVID-19, 75% com o fenotipo SS e 25% com o fenotipo SC. Todos os pacientes eram da Grande Vitoria. O diagnostico foi realizado por RT-PCR de swab nasal em 75% e 25% por exame sorologico (IgG positivo). Nenhum paciente relatou contato com caso suspeito ou confirmado da COVID-19. A metade deles necessitou de internacao hospitalar, nenhum necessitou de internacao em UTI, apenas 25% necessitou de oxigenioterapia. Dois pacientes (50%) necessitou de transfusao sanguinea. Todos utilizavam a hidroxiureia para o tratamento da doenca de base. Os sintomas mais prevalentes foram febre (4/4), odinofagia (3/4) e dor muscular (3/4). Um paciente (25%) apresentou quadro neurologico atipico com disturbio de marcha e mantem acompanhamento com neurologista para elucidacao desta sequela. Nenhum paciente apresentou quadro de crise algica ou sindrome toracica aguda durante a infeccao pelo coronavirus. Discussao: A pandemia da COVID -19 trouxe varios desafios para os pacientes que ja apresentavam outras co-morbidades. Os pacientes com doenca falciforme, em geral, necessitam de atendimento em emergencias por outros motivos e a principio sao considerados de risco devido ao comprometimento do sistema imune. Nessa amostra todos os pacientes adquiriam a doenca por provavel infeccao comunitaria, nenhum caso apresentou vinculo temporal com atendimento em instituicoes de saude. A sindrome toracica aguda e uma das principais causas de mortalidade entre portadores da doenca falciforme podendo ser desencadeada por infeccoes respiratorias e, portanto, e uma preocupacao de complicacao desses pacientes. Na amostra analisada os pacientes apresentaram sintomas leves, apenas um caso apresentou-se de maneira atipica com sequela neurologica. Uma serie de quatro casos publicados pelo Reino Unido chamou a atencao para as complicacoes respiratorias desenvolvidas por pacientes com esse diagnostico, o que nao foi observado em nossa serie de casos. Conclusao: Em geral os pacientes apresentaram quadro leve da COVID-19, entretanto e necessario atencao para o agravamento da anemia com necessidade transfusional, independente da presenca de crise algica, sindrome toracica aguda ou outra apresentacao tipica da anemia falciforme.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Role of Rasayan churna in outbreak of COVID-19 as preventive and curative aspect. In last two decade world suffer with three epidemic diseases like SARS-CoV, H1N1 influenza, MERS -CoV and presently the world under a pandemic of Covid-19, out of these SARS-CoV, MERS -CoV and Covid-19 are form the same virus call as corona, which primary present on bats and transferred from ani-mal to human, and then it transfer from human to human mostly by respiratory droplets or in the direct contact with the diseased person, these recurrent infection of corona virus is the burning issue in the word, so to avoid these recurrent infections good habitual behaviour with regular immune booster medicine should be taken which can be used in both normal and symptomatic patient for this Rasayan churna is the best drug of choice as it is used for reju-venation therapy. From literally study from various recourses it is found that Rasayan churna have property anti-depressant, anti-xylotic, Immunomodu-latory, Anti-diabetes, anti hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, Anti-toxic effects, Anti-arthritic, Anti-cancer effects, Anti-microbial effect, and Anti-oxidant which can be useful in preventive aspect of Covid-19 in all phase like normal individual, also can be used in asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients, clinical study can be performed for the same to evaluate the result.Copyright © 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

0	2019-nCoV routes, current trends and future dental challenges in India. Coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) emerged as a global health threat. World Health Organization (WHO) unveiled it as an international emergent situation. 2019-nCoV person-to-person transmission typically occurs through cough-ing, sneezing, droplet inhaling, and surface touch. Containment measures are needed to prevent further spread. It is worth mentioning that the risk of cross-infection among patients and dentists are high as oral investigations and treatment measures involve one-on-one contact, exposure to blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids. Therefore, effective countermeasures shall be planned to inhibit 2019-nCoV transmission in the dental setting as well. This review article highlights the essential knowledge of possible transmission routes of 2019-nCoV in dental settings. It also focuses on effective practice to be fol-lowed by dental health care practitioners (DHCP) to block the routes of transmission in dental clinics and hospitals. The article also attempts to highlight future challenges involved in a dental setting in India. This review will be espe-cially helpful for dentists and maxillofacial in following the informed guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Copyright © 2020, J. K.

0	Review on utility of preferred drugs from Dashanga lepa as herbal hand sanitizer intended for pandemic COVID 19. Today the global attention warranted by the condition which has been posed by covid 19 virus which spreads coughing or sneezeing of an infected person through droplets of saliva or nasal discharge.Person to person contact is to be the main method of transmission for this virus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Unfortunately, there is no specific vaccine or efficient antiviral treatment for coronavirus at present. Thus prevention is only the solution at present time. As hands are the prime modes of spread of microbes and infections, so hand hygiene is mainly an essential measure to keep away the infections. Several studies suggested that 99.9% of the bacteria on hands were killed by the sanitizers. Now to strengthen the prevention and to control activities, it is the time turning to alternative medicine stream like Ayurveda. A polyherbal preparation called Dashanga lepa is used to treat many skin disorders. In this review we summarize the antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal effects reported for herbs present in dashanga lepa. Considering this, an attempt has been made to screen classi-cal literature for the herbs of Dashanga lepa which can be used in ready-made herbal hand sanitizer.Copyright © 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

0	A survey-based estimate of COVID-19 incidence and outcomes among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and impact on the process of care. Rationale: Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) typically undergo frequent clinical evaluation. The incidence and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its impact on routine management for patients with pulmonary vascular disease is currently unknown. Objective(s): To assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19 for patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, and to evaluate the pandemic's impact on clinic operations at these centers. Method(s): A survey was e-mailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. Result(s): Seventy-seven center directors were successfully e-mailed a survey, and 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.9 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general U.S. population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH for whom COVID-19 was recognized, 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in patients with PAH/CTEPH diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse. Although the total number of patients with PAH/CTEPH recognized to have COVID-19 was small, the impact of COVID-19 on broader clinic operations, testing, and treatment was substantial.Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society	false
0	Mucocutaneous Manifestations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Importance: To date, no study has characterized the mucocutaneous features seen in hospitalized children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or the temporal association of these findings with the onset of systemic symptoms., Objective: To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020., Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C., Main Outcomes and Measures: Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists., Results: Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%). Of the 35 patients, 29 (83%) exhibited mucocutaneous changes, with conjunctival injection (n = 21), palmoplantar erythema (n = 18), lip hyperemia (n = 17), periorbital erythema and edema (n = 7), strawberry tongue (n = 8), and malar erythema (n = 6) being the most common findings. Recognition of mucocutaneous findings occurred a mean of 2.7 days (range, 1-7 days) after the onset of fever. The duration of mucocutaneous findings varied from hours to days (median duration, 5 days [range, 0-11 days]). Neither the presence nor absence of mucocutaneous findings was significantly associated with overall disease severity., Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of hospitalized children with suspected MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide spectrum of mucocutaneous findings was identified. Despite their protean and transient nature, these mucocutaneous features serve as important clues in the recognition of MIS-C.	false
0	[Laboratory testing, prevention and control of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019]. With many hard efforts, the epidemic prevention and control work in China has borne successful, accelerating the gradual restoration of production, living order and routine medical work. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but they are potential transmitter of the virus. There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic. Therefore, it is urgent to develop better screening and laboratory testing for asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 with high speed, sensitivity and specificity. It is also important to improve our risk assessment, prevention and control strategies to further prevent the spread of the epidemic.	false
0	"[Preliminary study of the antibody level in confirmed patients with COVID-19 after discharge]. Objective: To analyze the antibody levels and dynamic changes in patients infected with 2019-novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). Methods: The average age of 72 corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients was (45.53+/-16.74)years(median age:47 year), including (44.88+/-17.09) years(median age:46 year) for 38 males and (46.32+/-16.52)years (median age:46 year) for 34 females in Loudi City, Hunan Province. There is no significant difference in genders between the severe and mild groups (chi2=0.916, P>0.05). There is a significant difference in the age between the severe and mild groups (F=3.315, P<0.05). The blood samples of 72 discharged patients were collected and the consistence of IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence method. SPSS25.0 was used for gender, age, case type and antibody analysis of variance, chi2 test and other analysis. Results: The average time of the serum samples collection of 72 patients was (34.89+/-9.02)days (median time: 34 days) from onset of COVID-19, and (14.53+/-8.35) days (median time: 14 days) from discharge. The positive rate of IgM or IgG was 97.22% (70/72), and the positive rate of IgM and IgG was 48.61% (35/72) and 97.22% (70/72) respectively. Serum COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 72 patients from 1st to 40th days after discharge. The average concentration of IgM in 1-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-28 days, above 29 days were 21.91(7.07-52.84)AU/ml, 14.16(6.19-32.88)AU/ml, 11.36(6.65-42.15)AU/ml, 8.15(3.66-30.12)AU/ml, 2.98(0.46-6.37)AU/ml. There was no significant difference in the time of IgM antibody concentration (H= 8.439, P>0.05). The average concentrations of IgG in 1-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-28 days, 29 days and above were 169.90 (92.06-190.91) AU/ml, 163.89 (91.19-208.02) AU/ml, 173.31 (95.06-191.28) AU/ml, 122.84 (103.19-188.34) AU/ml, 101.98 (43.75-175.30) AU/ml, respectively, (H=2.232, P>0.05). The IgM becomes negative after the 3rd week of discharge and decreases rapidly with time. The IgG concentration higher than IgM during the same period, and keep at high level without any change, and decrease in the fourth week. Among them, 5 cases developed ""re-infection"" within 1-3 weeks after discharge, and the rate of ""re-infection"" was 6.94% (5/72 cases). Conclusions: After the COVID-19 patients are discharged from the hospital, the level of antibodies produced varies greatly among individuals, but the overall changes in antibodies have a certain pattern. It is recommended to strengthen the antibody monitoring during hospitalization and after discharge from the hospital to reduce the ""re-infection"" rate and potential risk of infection."	false

0	Intravenous immunoglobulin may reverse multisystem inflammation in covid-19 pneumonitis and guillain-barre syndrome. Introduction: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented crisis for public health, although several potential therapies have been provisionally applied but a unified consensus is yet to be achieved. Case description: A 75-year-old man, COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive on admission, presented with acute onset progressively ascending weakness of all four limbs. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study suggested acute demyelinating and axonal type of motor polyradiculo neuropathy. Hence, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) related to COVID-19 infection was considered. His respiratory status worsened to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on the second week of illness. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) dosed over 5 days. His ventilator support started to improve after the 10th day of admission. His inflammatory markers started to improve, ventilator supports were weaned down and he was extubated on the 17th day of illness. Intravenous immunoglobulin is rich in viral immunoglobulin G (IgG), competitively binds Fcy receptor, preventing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor, inhibiting viral entry into the cell. Clinical significance: Intravenous immunoglobulin can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors and decrease inflammatory injury, multisystem inflammation (MSI) in SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): While the use of hyperimmune globulin requires a tedious job of collection from convalescent patients with verified and adequate titers, the use of IVIg could be an easier option to modulate the immune storm and faster recovery in SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © The Author(s).	false
0	Acute liver injury in COVID-19: Risk factors in a large pediatric cohort. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with acute liver injury in adults, but liver injury has not been well characterized in pediatric patients We aim to describe the prevalence of liver injury in children in the setting of acute severe respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) infection and to identify risk factors for the development of COVID-19-associated liver disease Methods: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of all patients <= 21 years of age with an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction presenting between March 14th to June 30th, 2020 to two tertiary children's hospitals in New York City Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at both institutions Patients without aminotransferase testing or those with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were excluded from analysis Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (>30 U/L) and severe if ALT was more than five times ULN Results: A total of 225 patients were evaluated The mean age was 11 years (standard deviation +/- 7 years); 61% were male, 55% were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, and 21% were black. Obesity was identified in 35% of children; 7% had pre-existing liver disease The majority (74%) of patients were hospitalized, while 23% of patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 8% developed multi-organ failure (MOF) Two percent of patients (5/225) died 45% of patients developed acute liver injury (median 67 U/L, [IQR 45-160] U/L), and severe liver injury (median 271 [IQR 193- 389] U/L) was noted in 12% of all children The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms was reported in 54% of patients Factors associated with acute liver injury in univariate analysis included age (p = 0 015), obesity (p = 0 0001), pre-existing liver disease (p = 0.005), elevated inflammatory markers such as ferritin (p < 0 0001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0 0001), d-dimer (p = 0 002), as well as MOF (p = 0 0009) and ICU admission (p = 0 026) In multivariate regression model, acute liver injury was significantly associated with older age (OR 1 18; p = 0 01), CRP (OR 1 07; p = 0 01) and ICU admission (OR 8 9, p = 0 02) Clinical and laboratory characteristics are listed in the Table 1 Conclusion(s): Acute liver injury is common in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection but is most often mild Patients who are older and those with higher disease severity may be at risk for more significant liver injury.(Table Presented).	false
0	Serological Blood Group Discrepancy and Cold Agglutinin Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Associated With Novel Coronavirus. A case of a 45-year-old male presentation with viral pneumonia with anemia and thrombocytopenia and was admitted to COVID-19 ICU. The blood bank encountered a discrepancy in blood grouping and cross-match, which were subsequently resolved. The patient presented to the emergency room with fever and shortness of breath. He had tachycardia, fever, and had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. His SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive. Total and unconjugated bilirubin was raised. Due to the anemia and falling haemoglobin, he was not started on any anticoagulation. On investigation, the patient's direct Antiglobulin test was positive. Cold agglutinin titer at 4-degree Celsius was 64. The blood sample showed auto agglutination at collection and discrepancy in blood grouping and cross-matching, which were subsequently resolved. As observed in this case report, COVID-19 infection can be associated with cold agglutinin disease and Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinins should be recognized as potentially significant due to interference with laboratory investigations and complications associated with COVID-19.	false
0	Early Experience With Methylprednisolone on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the African American Population, a Retrospective Analysis. Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality rates. In African American (AA) populations, COVID-19 presentations and outcomes are more severe. NIH and Interim WHO guidelines had suggested against the use of corticosteroids unless in clinical trials until the recent publication of the RECOVERY trial. Here, we analyzed the treatment effect of methylprednisolone on patients with AKI and ARDS during the initial 2 months of COVID-19 and detail the learning effect within our institution. Method(s): Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, 75 AA patients met our inclusion criteria for ARDS and AKI, of which 37 had received corticosteroids. Twenty-eight-day mortality, improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and renal function were analyzed. The impact of methylprednisolone treatment was assessed with multivariable methods. Result(s): Survival in the methylprednisolone group reached 51% at 21 days compared to 29% in the non-corticosteroid group (P <.001). Methylprednisolone improved the likelihood of renal function improvement. PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the methylprednisolone group improved by 73% compared to 45% in the non-corticosteroid group (P =.01). Age, gender, BMI, preexisting conditions, and other treatment factors did not show any impact on renal or PaO2/FiO2 ratio improvement. The use of anticoagulants, the month of treatment, and AKI during hospitalization also influenced outcomes. Conclusion(s): In AA COVID-19 positive patients with ARDS and AKI, IV methylprednisolone lowered the incidence of mortality and improved the likelihood of renal and lung function recovery. Further investigation with a randomized control trial of corticosteroids is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Factors associated with psychological distress among filipinos during coronavirus disease-19 pandemic crisis. BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, psychological reactions of the population play a critical role in both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress and social disorder. AIM: This study aimed to measure the prevalence and severity of psychological distress to evaluate the current mental health burden on society that leads to the provision of a concrete basis for tailoring and implementing relevant mental health intervention policies to efficiently and effectively respond to the challenges brought by the pandemic. METHOD(S): An anonymous, internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020. In this regard, a structured online questionnaire was utilized to collect sociodemographic data and the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sociodemographic and prevalence of CPDI among respondents. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of distress. RESULT(S): Most of the respondents did not feel distressed about COVID-19 (52.1%), whereas 39.5% and 8.4% had mild-to-moderate and severe distress. The regression analysis demonstrated that higher religion and faithfulness levels, lower levels of education, and living in Mindanao (unlike those living in the Visayas) were associated with lower levels of psychological distress among the Filipino respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Policy-makers and practitioners in the in Filipino society need to consider key factors such as religion, education, and the region where they live in to reduce psychological distress among Filipinos.Copyright © 2020 Roy Rillera Marzo, Emilio Quilatan Villanueva III, Erwin Martinez Faller, Aries Moralidad Baldonado.	false
0	"Current perspective on determinants and deterrents of COVID-19. Introduction: COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has left several countries grappling with a devastating pandemic. Developing an effective COVID 19 vaccine may be possible but there are significant issues with public distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Public health efforts aimed at testing symptomatic patients, and other preventative measures, however, these efforts have been unable to significantly curtail the pandemic. There is a paucity of research that comprehensively focuses on determinants and deterrents to identify critical knowledge gaps. This review aims to focus efforts on strategies to contain the virus. Material(s) and Method(s): Google Scholar, PubMed, and archives of preprints were searched with the following terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""epidemiology"", ""determinants"", and ""deterrents."" The reference lists of articles were examined for relevant studies. Result(s): All age groups are susceptible and can transmit the virus. Individuals with severe outcomes include but are not limited to age 65 years or older, male sex, ethnic minorities, and the presence of comorbidities. Misinformation on social media and other traditional information sources is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Indoor and outdoor aerosolization of SARSCoV- 2, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic transmission, and incubation period of over 14 days in some infected individuals have been reported. Widespread rapid SARS-CoV-2 population screening and contact tracing are methods of effective containment including proper use of facemasks in crowded outdoor or indoor spaces, installation of HEPA filters, regular hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. Simple cost-effective measures include opening doors and windows of buildings where possible. Conclusion(s): Achieving herd immunity with a vaccine may be difficult because of misinformation. A potential incubation period of over 14 days is the bane of Covid-19 current control strategies. More research is needed including investigating the long-term effects of Covid-19 particularly in children, and fecal aerosol transmission. Evidence-based information and the identified infection prevention measures should be advocated.Copyright © 2020 A. CARBONE Editore. All rights reserved."	false
0	PIN34 COVID 19 - What Is the Health-Economic Economically Justifiable Price of Lockdown?. Objectives: Many European governments have imposed emergency lockdown measures to reduce interpersonal contact and slow the spread of COVID 19. This has led to substantial reductions in transmission rates and burden of disease but at a very high economic cost. Using health-economic principles, we assess whether lockdown is a cost-effective intervention in five European countries. Method(s): An SIR dynamic transmission model was fitted to COVID 19 incidence data from the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy to estimate total case numbers with and without a government-imposed lockdown. Hospitalisation cost and lockdown costs (based on estimated reductions in GDP) were used to estimate total cost, with QALYs and life-years estimated from observed mortality rates. In the scenario without lockdown, hospitalisations were capped based on health-care capacity, transmission adjusted for 'natural' social distancing, and GDP reduced to account for the impact of disease. Result(s): R0 before lockdown varied from 2.20 to 2.85 and after from 0.40 to 0.75. After the initial upswing, R0 varied between 1.36 and 1.77 in the no-lockdown scenario. Infection rates without lockdown were between 100 and 260 times higher than with lockdown. Incremental costs ranged from $3bn in France to $116bm in Germany, driven by the size of the economy in Germany and high hospitalisation rates observed in France. Per capita costs were highest in Italy at $1,648 per person and lowest in France at $52 per person. Incremental QALYs ranged from 12m in Italy to 30m in France, driven by differences in mortality rates. ICERs varied from $115 per QALY in France to $8,300 per QALY in Italy. Incremental costs per life-year followed similar patterns. Conclusion(s): Lockdown is an expensive but cost-effective intervention. Whilst the average cost across all five countries is over $1,000 per person, cost-effectiveness is driven by huge reductions in hospitalisation and deaths.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 and Hyperimmune sera: A feasible plan B to fight against coronavirus. Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different treatment strategies have been explored. These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	A case series report of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection in Jinan, China. In December 2019, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection was reported in Wuhan, China. The disease has spread rapidly throughout China and the rest of the world. It not only occurred in adults but also in some children. So, in this report, we aimed to clarify the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics; treatment; and outcomes of children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in Jinan, China, and found that children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection are non-specific and are milder than adults. Asymptomatic infections were common. Chest computed tomographic scanning is helpful for diagnosis. While myocardial creatine kinase-myocardial band was prone to increase in these cases. The prognosis of most cases was better. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	DOENCA DAS CELULAS FALCIFORMES E COVID-19: UMA REVISAO DE LITERATURA. Este estudo busca compreender, a partir das producoes cientificas, as implicacoes da COVID-19 em pacientes com doenca falciforme. Trata-se de uma revisao integrativa de literatura construida a partir da busca na base de dados MEDLINE da Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina dos Estados Unidos, utilizando-se das ferramentas de busca do PUBMED, na qual foram encontrados 35 estudos. Apos a leitura dos resumos, foram selecionados 16 artigos para leitura na integra. De acordo com a pesquisa, verificamos que grande parte dos pacientes portadores de doenca falciforme e com resultado positivo para COVID-19, pode desencadear graves complicacoes pulmonares, crise vaso-oclusiva (CVO) e Sindrome Toracica Aguda (STA), mesmo na ausencia de sintomas gripais. Em relacao ao indice de mortalidade, percebeu-se que as pessoas que tiveram genotipos geralmente associados a DF mais leves (tipos HbSC ou HbSbeta +-talassemia), sao mais propensas a desenvolver um quadro mais grave, necessitar de Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI) e ate mesmo evoluir para obito. No que se refere ao genero e a idade, verificou-se que o sexo feminino predominou com 56,8% dos casos, e a faixa etaria prevalente entre 20-40 anos, no entanto, estes dois fatores nao foram evidenciados como agravantes em pessoas com DF. Em relacao ao tratamento, a maioria dos artigos cita que foi realizado o tratamento de protocolo padrao para as complicacoes pulmonares, CVO, STA e demais a depender dos sintomas que eles apresentavam. Ha relatos de desenvolvimento favoravel rapido do estado respiratorio de dois pacientes, 45 e 16 anos, com anemia falciforme e COVID-19 grave tratados com tocilizumabe que, por sua vez, age inibindo a transducao do sinal de citocinas pro-inflamatorias minimizando o estado hiper inflamatorio causado pela infeccao. No mais, infere-se que a infeccao por SARS-CoV-2 aumenta o risco de tromboembolismo e CVO em pacientes com traco falciforme, enquanto que em pacientes com anemia falciforme a principal complicacao e a STA. Nesse contexto, o rastreamento de trombose pulmonar atraves de exames laboratoriais e clinicos e crucial para um bom prognostico.

Com os primeiros casos de HIV/AIDS no inicio dos anos 80 medidas foram tomadas para garantir a qualidade dos suprimentos de sangue. Dentre elas a proibicao de homens que tiveram sexo com homens (HSH) de doar sangue foi imediatamente adotada. O questionamento das politicas de restricao a doacao de sangue decorre de perspectivas quanto a defesa dos direitos humanos, promocao de igualdade e cidadania e alegacao de discriminacao. Atraves de pesquisa bibliografica buscou-se elucidar o historico e a evolucao da legislacao relacionada ao tema ate os dias atuais. Atualmente politicas regulatorias para recrutamento e selecao de doadores de sangue foram estabelecidas de modo a minimizar o risco de transmissao de infeccoes atraves de transfusao de sangue. Entretanto, com o avanco das tecnologias de analise do sangue e a era NAT, que reduz o periodo de janela imunologica para deteccao de agentes transmissores de doencas infecciosas, questiona-se o adiamento da doacao de sangue por esta populacao. As razoes e beneficios para a restricao a doacao por HSH vem sendo questionados por organizacoes ligadas a comunidade LGTB, desde que, quase quarenta anos apos as primeiras legislacoes, os metodos de triagem avancaram e a possibilidade de contaminacao por HIV por transfusao sanguinea e extremamente baixa. Com as novas tecnologias, a deteccao de doencas transmissiveis pelo sangue se tornou possivel em estagio inicial, o que seria um argumento para a flexibilizacao da inaptidao da doacao de sangue por HSH, desejosos em contribuir para a preparacao de desastres e fortalecimento no fornecimento de sangue. No entanto, a persistencia de um periodo de janela imunologica, alem da emergencia de outras doencas transmitidas pelo sangue desde a descoberta da AIDS, que se demonstraram mais prevalentes nesta populacao, reforcam o argumento cientifico para a manutencao das politicas restricao. Os paises tem adotado tres principais estrategias sobre esta questao: (a) inaptidao permanente apos qualquer relacao sexual entre homens; (b) inaptidao temporaria, entre tres meses a dez anos apos a ultima relacao sexual entre homens e (c) avaliacao de comportamento de risco baseado em criterios, independentemente da opcao sexual. O processo para mudancas dessas politicas envolve avaliacoes, governamentais e externas, das percepcoes publicas de risco e confianca no sistema do sangue, alem da avaliacao dos novos riscos gerados por essas alteracoes. Num historico muito recente, a pandemia por COVID-19 trouxe desafios muito grandes aos estoques de suprimentos sanguineos nos Estados Unidos. Diante disso o FDA, baseado em estudos epidemiologicos recentes, onde se verificou que mudancas nos criterios de elegibilidade dos doadores nao comprometeria a seguranca do sangue, passou a restricao de doacao dos HSH de 12 meses para 3 meses a partir de abril de 2020. Em maio de 2020 o Superior Tribunal Federal (STF) brasileiro decidiu, por maioria de votos, derrubar restricoes a doacao de sangue por homens que fazem sexo com homens. Tornando desta forma as normas do Ministerio da Saude e da Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (Anvisa) inconstitucionais. Publicada em 08 de julho de 2020, a RDC ndegree 399 revoga esta restricao em cumprimento a ordem judicial. O desafio ainda e como avancar nos criterios de selecao de doadores e minimizar tempo de restricao, mantendo a seguranca do sangue e a confianca das pessoas.Copyright © 2020	false

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid.	false

Until the end of November 2020, there were over 50 x 106 people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide and it caused at least 1 x 106 deaths. These numbers are still increasing. To control the spread of the pandemic and to choose a suitable treatment plan, a fast, accurate, effective, and ready-to-use diagnostic method has become an important prerequisite. In this Review, we introduce the principles of multiple off-site and on-site detection methods for virus diagnosis, including qPCR-based, ELISA-based, CRISPR-based methods, etc. All of these methods have been successfully implanted on the microfluidic platform for rapid screening. We also summarize currently available diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Some of them not only can be used to analyze the SARS and MERS but also have the potential for COVID-19 detection after modifications. Finally, we hope that understanding of current microfluidic-based detection approaches can help physicians and researchers to develop advanced, rapid, and appropriate clinical detection techniques that reduce the financial expenditure of the society, accelerate the examination process, increase the accuracy of diagnosis, and eventually suppress the worldwide pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease in the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns are raised over their threat to mental health especially among vulnerable groups including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have tested whether and how these control measures may affect mental health. No study investigated prevalence and impacts of utilizing eHealth among pregnant women during the outbreak., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated 1) the roles of lockdown and mandatory quarantine in affecting mental health problems (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms), 2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and 3) the moderation roles of eHealth-related factors (i.e., social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services during COVID-19) among pregnant women in China., METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions (24 February-10 March, 2020)., RESULTS: Of the participants, 62.6% reported lockdown in the areas of residence and 3.8% were subjected to mandatory quarantine; 44.6% reported probable depression, 29.2% had probable anxiety, and 7.4% reported suicidal ideation. Only 3.3% of the participants reported using online prenatal care service during the outbreak. Significant socio-demographic/maternal variables of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, area of residence, gestational duration, number of children born, complication during pregnancy, means of utilizing prenatal care services, and social media use for health information. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modeling [chi2(df)=495.21(14), p<.05, CFI=.99, NNFI=.98, RMSEA=.04 (90%CI=.038, .045)] showed quarantine status was strongly associated with poor mental health status directly and indirectly through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04, beta =.02, 95%CI=.01 to .02, p=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03, beta=.03, 95%CI=.02 to .03, p=.001). Multi-group analyses revealed social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths., CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance to integrate mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policy. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators are modifiable, and can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Natural SARS-CoV-2 infections, including virus isolation, among serially tested cats and dogs in households with confirmed human COVID-19 cases in Texas, USA. The natural infections and epidemiological roles of household pets in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not understood. We conducted a longitudinal study of dogs and cats living with at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected human in Texas and found 47.1% of 17 cats and 15.3% of 59 dogs from 25.6% of 39 households were positive for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR and genome sequencing or neutralizing antibodies. Virus was isolated from one cat. The majority (82.4%) of infected pets were asymptomatic. Re-sampling of one infected cat showed persistence of viral RNA at least 32 d-post human diagnosis (25 d-post initial test). Across 15 antibody-positive animals, titers increased (33.3%), decreased (33.3%) or were stable (33.3%) over time. A One Health approach is informative for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	false
0	Elucidating the pivotal role of convalescent plasma therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients: A review. World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. Currently almost every country in the world has reported cases with moderate to high mortality rates. The European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) are the severely affected countries. Nevertheless, the WHO is very much concern about countries with weak health systems. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varies extensively, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe as well as critical pneumonia with high mortality rates in the elderly and patients with co-morbid medical illness. Convalescent Plasma Therapy (CPT) has been successfully used in treating various viral disease outbreaks such as 1918 influenza pneumonia pandemic, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, Machupo virus, Junin virus, Lassa virus, Ebola etc. High-titer specific antibodies maybe capable of binding to Coronavirus- 19 (CoV-19) and neutralize the viral particles, inhibit entry to uninfected cells, and trigger potent effector mechanisms such as complement activation as well as phagocytosis. Therefore, in most countries with very weak health systems with no Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or trained ICU physicians, early initiation of CPT for severely COVID- 19 patients may be rewarding. Therefore, solidarity control trials on CPT for COVID- 19 patients involving large number of patients are urgently needed. ©Copyright: the Author(s).	false
0	HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 Share Recognized Epitopes by the Humoral Response in Sera of People Collected Pre- and during CoV-2 Pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause serious illness in older adults and people with chronic underlying medical conditions; however, children and young people are often asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. We evaluated the presence of specific antibodies (Abs) response against Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) S protein epitopes (NL63-RBM1, NL63-RBM2_1, NL63-RBM2_2, NL63-RBM3, NL63-SPIKE541-554, and NL63-DISC-like) and SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (COV2-SPIKE421-434 and COV2-SPIKE742-759) in plasma samples of pre-pandemic, mid-pandemic, and COVID-19 cohorts by indirect ELISA. Moreover, a competitive assay was performed to check for cross reactivity response between COV2-SPIKE421-434 and NL63-RBM3 among patients with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Immune reaction against all SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 epitopes showed a significantly higher response in pre-pandemic patients compared to mid-pandemic patients. The results indicate that probably antibodies against HCoV-NL63 may be able to cross react with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the higher incidence in pre-pandemic was probably due to the timing of collection when a high incidence of HCoV-NL63 is reported. In addition, the competitive assay showed cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against COV2-SPIKE421-434 and NL63-RBM3 peptides. Pre-existing HCoV-NL63 antibody response cross reacting with SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in both pre- and mid-pandemic individual, suggesting that previous exposure to HCoV-NL63 epitopes may produce antibodies which could confer a protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and probably reduce the severity of the disease.	false
0	Salient Conclusive Remarks on Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of Pediatric COVID-19: Narrative Review. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), constituted significant public health concerns and impacted the human populations with massive economic and social burdens worldwide. The disease is known to infect people of all ages, including children, adults, and the elderly. Although several reports about pediatric COVID-19 were seen in the literature, we believe that the epidemiology and pathology of the infection described in these reports are not conclusive. Therefore, in this scientific communication, a narrative review study was performed to shed some light on the characteristic epidemiological features and clinical phenotypes of pediatric COVID-19. In this report, we had compiled and presented the different epidemiological features of the disease related to the age of infection, virus acquisition, explanations of the low infectivity rates, and consequences of infections. The discriminatory clinical manifestations of the disease in children were also addressed and discussed in this review. The search included the data published from the date of the start of the pandemic in December 2019 up to October 2020. Our literature search revealed that children of all ages, including neonates, had been infected by the virus. Despite the fact that pediatric COVID-19 is less common to occur, as compared to the disease in adults, the infected children usually manifest the disease symptomatology in benign form. Asymptomatic and symptomatic adult patients are the primary source of the virus to the children. Intrauterine transmission of the virus and breastfeeding infections to the neonates were hypothesized in some studies but ruled out since they were not confirmed. Intensive review and discussion warranting the low infection rates and benign conditions of COVID-19 in children were also made in this study. As documented in many studies, the infectivity, morbidity, and mortality rates of the disease among the children populations are much lower than those in adults. They also seem to be lower than those observed during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics. The described clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 in children do not differ much from those of adults, and complications of the disease seem to be associated with comorbidities.

0	Impact of cardiovascular disease and risk factors on fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 according to age: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder. We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50-60 years and >=60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death., RESULTS: We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former., CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020198152.

0	"Diagnostic laboratory and COVID-19: Is it possible to estabilish a strategy for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection through the combined use of molecular and serological tests?. The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2) pandemic, known as COVID-19, has involved the world's population in an onerous and emotionally charged challenge with serious repercussions on health and economy, engaging medical personnel, health workers, scientists and politicians in the front line. SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and is spreading worldwide. The epidemiology and ecology of the infection is not yet fully known: The virus reservoir has been identified in bats, but the intermediate host and the exact modalities of the species jump, with transmission to humans, are not yet unequivocally identified. In this scenario, laboratory medicine plays an important role, both in research and diagnostics. Today, we have more information on the nature of SARS-CoV-2: Thanks to the research work of doctors, biologists and technicians in laboratories, we obtained more insights on gene sequence, pathogenetic mechanisms, the first therapeutic hypotheses and experiments for a vaccine. The identification of the sequences of the viral genome, consisting of a single stranded RNA, has led to the rapid availability of diagnostic tests based on the application of RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction), giving a fundamental tool for the early detection of viral RNA in rhino-pharyngeal swabs, the isolation and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the tracing of contacts and the promotion of social containment measures. However, the rapid geographical spread of the virus, with its high degree of contagiousness, the percentage of serious cases requiring hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs) and the increased lethality found in some regions has caused great difficulty in the management of COVID-19 patients, due to the lack of adequate facilities and technologies. The finding of asymptomatic and/or paucisymptomatic subjects, with the virus in the incubation phase, has made even more evident the need for efficient and early diagnostics, but molecular tests, for various analytical and extra-analytical limitations, cannot be used as only diagnostic test in possible scenarios of virus spread, in the general population: A change of strategy is needed that is more adherent to daily clinical practice. We have seen rapid development of serological tests to identify the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but due to the lack of robustness of the available data, there is little evidence of their quality and diagnostic efficacy. The purpose of this discussion is to verify the possibility of a ""real life"" strategy in the management of SARS-CoV2 infection, through the integration of molecular and serological tests, to obtain indications on the best diagnostic algorithm to be applied, at the state of the art of recent knowledges.Copyright © 2020 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

0	Metabolic and liver alterations impact on the severity of SARS-COV2 disease. Background: SARS-COV2 is a threatful viral disease which can evolve into respiratory failure but identification of risk factors for progression towards severe forms is still ongoing During infection impairment of liver function tests has been frequently reported and evidence of the negative impact of metabolic alterations on the clinical course are emerging, mainly evaluated in Asiatic populations Aim: to define the prognostic role of metabolic disease and liver damage on SARS-COV2 severity in a cohort of Italian patients Methods: All patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to low-intensity care COVID Units between March and April 2020 were enrolled Severe SARS-COV2 infection was defined according to International consensus requiring intensive respiratory support (CPAP/orotracheal intubation) All data were collected at admission Results: 382 patients were enrolled, mean age was 65+/-17 ys and 60% were male Mean BMI was 27+/-5 kg/m2 (61% overweight and 25% obese), prevalence of T2DM 17%, hypertension 44%, dyslipidemia 29% At admission 39% and 40% of patients had increased ALT and GGT levels, respectively Median hospitalization stay was 14 days (IQR 8-24), with 30% of patients experiencing severe SARS-COV2 infection and mortality in 14% of overall cases Subjects with severe infection presented higher prevalence of male sex (68% vs 56%, p=0 03), T2DM (25% vs 14%, p=0 01), dyslipidemia (36% vs 26%, p=0 05) and increased ALT (53% vs 32%, p<0 001) and GGT (53% vs 34%, p=0 01) levels at admission In multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex, T2DM, dyslipidemia, increased ALT and GGT at admission and SARS-COV2 therapy), T2DM (OR 3 1, 95%CI 1 6-6 0; p=0 001), dyslipidemia (OR 1 9, 95%CI 1 1-3 3; p=0 03), and increased ALT (OR 4 7, 95%CI 2 5- 9 0; p<0 001) and GGT (OR 2 0, 95%CI 1 2-3-3; p=0 009), resulted associated with high risk of more severe SARSCOV2 disease Interestingly, in patients with both T2DM and dyslipidemia, this risk was further increased (OR 5 2, 95%CI 2 1-12 6; p<0 001) Conclusion(s): We confirm that liver involvement is common during SARS-COV2 infection and it is a negative prognostic factor although it is not clear whether it precedes or follows, the severity of clinical course In addition, the risk of severe form of respiratory distress is increased by metabolic alterations, and the more numerous the alterations, the higher the risk.	false
0	Liver injury is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Background: Based on current literature there appears to be a high prevalence of liver injury (LI) in patients with COVID-19 However, there are limited large scale studies on risk factors, morbidity, and mortality associated with LI in these patients We aim to determine risk factors and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and LI Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study at a large tertiary care hospital. All index admissions of adult patients with confirmed COVID19 between 3/1 to 4/30/2020 were included Data on baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes was collected during manual chart review Mild elevation in LFTs (MEL), defined as peak levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB) above upper limit of normal (ULN) but lower than the threshold for LI. LI was defined as peak ALT/AST three times ULN and/or peak ALP/TB two times ULN ULN threshold values of ALT 52, AST 35, TB 1 2, ALP 140 were used Both cohorts were compared with our control group, who had normal LFTs at presentation and throughout the hospitalization SAS 9 4 was used for analysis Results: A total of 1935 patients were included of which 507 (26 2%) had normal LFTs, 1030 (53 2%) had MEL, and 397 (20 5%) had LI Males were more commonly found in the MEL (p=0 0004) and LI groups compared to control (p< 0001) Patients in the MEL cohort were older (p=0 0005) African Americans were more likely to develop LI (p=0 0318) There was no difference in comorbidities between all groups Among patients with LI, 241 (61%) had a hepatocellular pattern, 20 (5%) had a cholestatic pattern, and 135 (34%) had a mixed pattern Patients with LI had an increased risk of mortality (RR 4 26 [95% CI 3 12, 5 81; p< 0001]), ICU admission (RR 5 52 [95% CI 4 07, 7 49; p< 0001]), intubation (RR 11 01 [95% CI 6 97, 17 34]); p< 0001) and 30-day readmission (1 81 [95% CI 1 17, 2 80; p< 0076]) (Table 2, Figure 1) compared to the control group Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 who present with LI have a significantly increased risk of mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and 30-day re-admission compared to patients with MEL and normal LFTs This information is important to appropriately manage COVID-19 patients Further research looking at risk prediction models and pooling multi-center data should include liver injury as a key variable.	false
0	Immune-inflammatory biomarkers' panel for severe COVID-19 patients. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. This study aimed to evaluate a panel of biomarkers in order to better phenotype population and to define the role of mediators as biomarkers of severity.Materials and methods: Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients at the hospital admission before any treatments and infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C peptide were measured with CLEIA methods. IL-6 assays were validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate group was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and a logistic regression was performed to combine parameters between the two groups. Result(s): In severe group, IL-6 CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly increased than mild-to-moderate patients. Moreover KL-6, IL-6 and CRP biomarkers resulted directly correlated. In the logistic regression, ROC curve analysis of the model comprise IL-6, KL-6 and CRP reported the best performance with an AUC 0,95. Conclusion(s): On corroborating previous reports on IL-6 over-expression in severe COVID 19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations are correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP. The combination of three prognostic bioindicators allowed to discriminate between severe COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis from mild-tomoderate patients.	false
0	"Biology and clinics of sars-cov-2 infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be considered the third coronavirus outbreak during the past 20 years, after severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012 [1]. The two former outbreaks caused altogether less than 2000 deaths, while COVID-19 has already affected several millions of people worldwide, causing hundreds of thousands deaths. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has endorsed that COVID-19 is caused a beta coronavirus, belonging to the same family of viruses causing common cold, and defined severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is an enveloped virus with positive-sense, singlestranded RNA genome, encoding four leading structural proteins, i.e., Spike (containing the receptor-binding domain through which the virus binds to its natural receptor at the surface of host cells), envelope protein, membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains additional genes, encoding accessory proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. SARS-CoV-2 spread from person to person through small droplets from nose or mouth, especially when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Contagion may also be possible also during aerosolgenerating procedures or transporting infected material from surfaces to eyes, nose and mouth. The cell receptor is angiotensin converting enzyme 2, expressed at the surface of many human cells (respiratory epithelia, pneumocytes, cells of heart, kidney, gastrointestinal system, adipose tissue and testis). Binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 involves the spike protein, which needs to be ""primed"" by another protein at cell surface, such as Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 or others (e.g., furin). The clinical picture of COVID-19 is dominated by cough, fever and dyspnoea, reflecting interstitial pneumonia. Less frequently reported are gastrointestinal symptoms, while upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chill and conjunctival congestion) seem infrequent. Myalgia, unusual headache, taste and olfactory disturbances are also described. COVID-19 is a gradually evolving pathology, characterized by five stages, sustained by different molecular and biological mechanisms. While remaining asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in many subjects (up to 70%), in others the illness progresses towards a respiratory phase with interstitial pneumonia. An abnormal, almost exaggerated, immune response in some of patients justifies the progression towards a third phase, with lung and systemic hyper-inflammation and injury. In a percentage variable between 2-5% of patients, the disease progresses into a fourth critical phase, where hyperinflammation triggers hemostasis activation, leading to intravascular coagulopathies such as pulmonary thrombosis, venous thromboembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patient treatment must hence be tailored according to stage or severity of disease. Cumulative worldwide mortality so far is 4-6%."	false
0	A computational approach to design potential siRNA molecules as a prospective tool for silencing nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2. An outbreak, caused by an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 named COVID-19 has become pandemic with a magnitude which is daunting to all public health institutions in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, efficacy prediction and molecular docking analysis, 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exert the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2020.

0	Pregnancy outcomes among symptomatic and asymptomatic women infected with COVID-19 in the west of Iran: a case-control study. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate pregnancy outcomes among symptomatic and asymptomatic women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the west of Iran., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 45 pregnant women infected with symptomatic COVID-19 were compared with 45 pregnant women infected with asymptomatic COVID-19. The cases included women were referred for delivery to hospitals of Hamadan Province and infected with COVID-19-related symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) detection. The control group included asymptomatic women who were referred for delivery to hospitals in Hamadan Province infected with COVID-19. Data were collected by a checklist. For the data analysis, the Stata version 12 was used (StataCorp, College Station, TX)., RESULTS: The odds of cesarean delivery in symptomatic women was more the fourfold higher (OR = 4.12, 95% CI (1.7, 10.05), p = .002). Moreover, the odds of LBW was significantly higher in symptomatic women (OR = 2.1, 95% CI (1.2, 6.29), p = .035)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that cesarean delivery and LBW were significantly higher in symptomatic women compared with asymptomatic women. In areas with high COVID-19 pandemics, the performance of the PCR test is recommended for all pregnant women upon admission for delivery.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 in renal transplant recipients: Report of two cases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic worldwide. The data about COVID-19 in renal transplant recipient are deficiency. Herein, we report two COVID-19 cases in renal transplant recipients. Both cases were discharged following a treatment regimen including discontinued immunosuppressant and low-dose methylprednisolone-based therapy. There were no signs of rejection during the treatment. These successfully treated cases can provide helpful information about the management of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	How COVID-19 Pandemic Changed Children and Adolescents Use of the Emergency Department: the Experience of a Secondary Care Pediatric Unit in Central Italy. Italy was the first European country hit by SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly northern regions. After the beginning of national lockdown (March 9th, 2020), we observed a significant decrease in pediatric emergency department consultations (daily pediatric visits; pre-lockdown, 16 (11-22); lockdown, 3 (1-3); phase 2, 3 (3-5), p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the percentage of children discharged right after pediatric visit significantly decreased from 80% in January to 50% in April. After March 9th, we registered a change in the diagnoses of emergency department visits, with an increase in the percentage of non-infectious acute conditions and a decrease in infectious diseases, with two cases of a noteworthy delayed access to hospital care. We performed a retrospective analysis of consultations requested to our pediatric unit for children and adolescents referred to the general Emergency Department of San Luca Hospital of Lucca (Tuscany, Central Italy) from January 1st to May 31st, 2020. We split data in two different time periods according to consultations performed before (January 1st-March 8th) and after the beginning of lockdown (March 9th-May 31st). Analyzing the number of children hospitalized from January to May 2020 in comparison with the same period in 2019, a decreased hospitalization became evident after March (March - 74.6%, April - 71.6%, May - 58.6%). Nasopharyngeal swabs done in 115 children showed only one case of COVID-19. Even if COVID-19 outbreak more seriously affected Northern Italy, utilization of pediatric emergency services significantly changed also in Central Italy with consequent reduced demand and increased appropriateness.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	COVID-19 impact on hepatitis b prevention programs in clinics serving at-risk populations. Background: Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection includes vaccination of susceptible individuals, testing and linkage to care of persons at risk for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) There are about 1 million persons living with CHB in the United States, and 32 states reported increased incidence of acute HBV infection in 2017 In July 2019, to address the public health burden of HBV infection, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health (OMH) funded six grantees (health department, federally qualified health center, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations) to develop comprehensive hepatitis B prevention programs, targeting at-risk populations who are disproportionately impacted by hepatitis B The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the OMH grantees' delivery of hepatitis B services to at-risk populations Methods: The six OMH grantees collected data from electronic health records during a 3-week period in June 2020 for two defined timeperiods; pre-pandemic from 12/1/2019 - 2/29/2020 and early-pandemic from 3/1/2020 - 5/31/2020 All patient visits to the clinics during pre-pandemic and early-pandemic were included Data was organized into the number of people tested for hepatitis B, number of hepatitis B vaccine doses given, number of telemedicine visits, and number of in-person clinic visits Data from all grantees were combined for this analysis Descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of hepatitis B services Results: Following the pre-pandemic period, there was a decrease in the number of in-person visits from 35,095 to 17,054 (63 5% decrease) and an increase in the number of telemedicine visits from 12 to 29,686 (211,566 7% increase) (Table 1) The overall number of patient visits increased from 35,107 to 46,740 (33 1% increase) The number of people tested for HBV decreased from 5,145 to 1,988 (70 5% decrease), and the number of HBV vaccine doses administered decreased from 2,432 to 999 (69 6% decrease) Conclusion(s): Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the six OMH grantees made progress on establishing hepatitis B prevention programs Grantees are utilizing telemedicine to provide healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet, hepatitis B services provided have been reduced substantially Innovative approaches to delivering hepatitis B vaccinations and testing are needed in the era of COVID-19(Table Presented).	false
0	Elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and inflammatory markers are associated with acute kidney injury and increased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Background: Recent studies from China have shown that liver biochemistries are abnormal in patients infected with SARS-CoV2 novel coronavirus, which may result from excessive inflammatory processes as a result of underlying cytokine storm However, there is a paucity of data on the association of elevated liver chemistries with the disease severity, acute kidney injury (AKI), coagulation markers, morbidity, and mortality in COVID-19 Methods: A retrospective analysis among hospitalized patients (n=149) with COVID-19 infection from March 17th to April 30th 2020 Data collection included patient demographics, co-morbidities (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obesity (BMI>30)) and laboratory parameters, such as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin (TBIL), D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Pearson correlation coefficients and Chi-square tests were computed between liver chemistries and inflammatory markers. Chi-square tests were also used to evaluate the incidence of AKI and mortality Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the independent effects of each potential prognostic factor Results: AST levels were elevated in 66% of patients while ALT was elevated in 24% and TBIL in 11% Elevated AST levels were associated with inflammatory markers including serum ferritin (r=0 4, p<0 001) and LDH (r=0 8, p<0 0001) Furthermore, the AST levels associated strongly with the coagulation parameters including D-dimer (r=0 5, p<0 0001) and PT (r=0 4, p<0 0001) Interestingly, ALT levels were also associated with serum ferritin (r=0 2, p<0 009), LDH (r=0 5, p<0 0001), D-dimer (r=0 2, p<0 01) and PT (r=0 2, p<0 02) Lastly, we also found correlation between high TBIL, D-Dimer (r=0 3, p<0 0007) and LDH (r=0 2, p<0 04) Increased levels of AST (p<0 03), TBIL (p=0 04) and ferritin (p=0 006) were associated with AKI in multivariate logistic regression analysis. While elevated liver chemistries and inflammatory markers were not associated with mortality in multivariate regression analysis, elevated AST levels neared statistical significance (p=0.08). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that liver function abnormalities are associated with increased inflammatory markers and abnormal coagulation factors. Furthermore, elevated AST and ferritin was associated with AKI and increased mortality Abnormal liver function tests and inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients were independent of associated co-morbidities.	false
0	Hepatic steatosis is associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but not elevated bilirubin or hepatic decompensation in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Possible association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and worse COVID-19 disease progression has been suggested but not well described in the United States We investigated whether COVID-19 was associated with elevations in liver enzymes or hepatic decompensation in patients with underlying hepatic steatosis Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of consecutive adults treated at the University of Michigan for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Hepatic steatosis was defined based on imaging >30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes were: (1) peak ALT or bilirubin following COVID-19 diagnosis, (2) ALT >2 or 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), defined as the higher of baseline ALT or 19 U/L in women and 30 U/L in men, and (3) jaundice defined as bilirubin >2 or 4 mg/dl We conducted regressions with the above outcomes as dependent variables and hepatic steatosis as the primary predictor These regression models were logistic for outcomes of abnormal ALT or bilirubin and linear for maximal ALT or bilirubin Results: Evidence of steatosis on prior imaging was found in 80/159 (50 3%) patients Overall, 89% of patients were hospitalized, 51% were admitted to intensive care unit, and 16% died Chronic liver disease other than NAFLD was found in 14% of patients, 5% had cirrhosis, and 2 7% had prior liver decompensation with ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy Patients with steatosis were younger, more often African-American with higher body mass index than those without steatosis Baseline ALT and total bilirubin were higher in the steatosis group Hepatic steatosis was associated with higher incidence of ALT >2x ULN (OR 2.93 [1.23-6.97]) or >5x ULN (OR 6.21 [1.45-26.62]), and with peak ALT (beta 39 7 [7 85-71 49]) Hepatic steatosis was not associated with increased bilirubin Rates of liver decompensation were very low: 1 3% and 2 5%, respectively, with no difference based on NAFLD status (p > 0.4 for both) (Table 1) Conclusion(s): Analysis from our cohort showed that NALFD is associated with acute hepatocellular injury in patients with COVID-19 Strengths of this study include granularity of data available for review Weaknesses include the observational and single-center nature of the study Larger scale multi-center studies are needed to corroborate these findings.(Table Presented).	false
0	Hepatic steatosis is associated with increased disease severity in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Possible association between hepatic steatosis (HS) and worse COVID-19 disease progression has been suggested but not well described in the United States We investigated whether patients with HS experienced worse disease outcomes from COVID-19 infection than those without Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 342 consecutive adult patients treated at the University of Michigan for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020. HS was defined as either prior imaging evidence of steatosis or hepatic steatosis index >36 for Asians or >39 for non-Asians. The primary outcome was disease severity based on admission to intensive care unit (ICU), intubation, death, or the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the predictors of ICU admission, intubation rate, or death and multivariable linear regression for disease severity on WHO ordinal scale HS was the primary predictor Results: A total of 342 patients were analyzed Median age was 63 years; 53 5% of patients were male and 44 4% Black, 52 6% required ICU admission, 34 2% required intubation, and 16% died A 178 patients (52%) had HS, who were younger (58 5 vs 66 5 years; p < 0 001), had higher body mass index (34 7 vs 26 6; p < 0 001), and had higher prevalence of diabetes (48 3% vs 37 8%; p = 0 06) than those without HS HS was independently associated with increased odds of requiring admission to the ICU (odds ratio [OR] 1 75 [1 09-2 81], p = 0 02) and intubation (OR 2 58 [1 56-4 28], p < 0 001), as well as higher WHO ordinal scale (beta 0 51 [0 11-0 92], p = 0.013). There was no significant association between HS and death (OR 0 83 [0 42-1 67], p = 0 61) (Table 1) Conclusion(s): Analysis from our cohort showed that HS is associated with worse disease outcomes, evidenced by increased odds of ICU admission, intubation rate, and WHO ordinal scale in patients with COVID-19(Table Presented).	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on ED visits in Lebanon. INTRODUCTION: As the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, emergency departments (ED) around the world began to report significant drops in volumes and changes in disease patterns. During the early COVID-19 period, Lebanon followed an aggressive containment approach to halt the spread of the disease., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the impact of the different national containment measures and the early COVID-19 outbreak in Lebanon on ED visit volume and disease spectrum in a single center ED in Lebanon., METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of ED visit administrative data, comparing ED visits during the three months period prior to the first identified COVID-19 case in Lebanon with the first 3 months post-COVID-19. A time series analysis of ED visit trends in relation to the major lockdown measures was conducted. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 27) and STATA version 15 (StataCorp LLC., College Station,TX). Statistical significance was set at 0.05., RESULTS: The daily ED visit volume significantly decreased in response to the closure of educational institutions (19.96% per day, p-value = 0.04) and the declaration of public mobilization state with border closure (97.11% per day, p-value <0.0001). ED visits decreased by 47.2% post-COVID-19. The drop was highest amongst pediatric patients (66.64%). Patients who presented post-COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 were older (40.39 +/- 24.96 vs 33.71 +/- 24.83, p-value <0.0001), had higher hospital admission rates (28.8% vs. 22.1%, p-value <0.0001), higher critical care admission rates (5.6% vs. 3.5%, p-value <0.001), and double mortality rate (0.4% vs 0.2%, p-value = 0.006). While visits for most diseases dropped, the odds of presenting to the ED post-COVID19 were higher for bacterial infections and non-communicable disease and lower for injuries and communicable diseases., CONCLUSION: ED visits dropped significantly during the COVID-19 containment period. Understanding the trends of changes in disease entities is important for ED staffing purposes during the pandemic and the varying containment efforts. While stringent lockdown measures were associated with drops in ED visits, understanding the reason behind these drops, specifically whether behavioral or related to true drops in disease prevalence, needs further exploration.

BACKGROUND: It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines would become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China., METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China during September 1-7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged >=18 years who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examination once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a sub-sample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (n=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China were likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years taken up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlled for significant background characteristics., RESULTS: Among the parents, the prevalence of parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.5% (n=764). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] 1.70, 95%CI 1.50-1.91), perceived family member would support them to have their children taken up COVID-19 vaccination (perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95%CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children taken up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95%CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95%CI 0.74-0.99)., CONCLUSIONS: Parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children aged under 18 years was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Saliva Rises Gradually and to Moderate Levels in Some Humans. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings often occurs before symptom onset, therefore testing strategies that can reliably detect people in the early phase of infection are urgently needed. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially critical to protect vulnerable populations who require frequent interactions with caretakers. Rapid COVID-19 tests have been proposed as an attractive strategy for surveillance, however a limitation of most rapid tests is their low sensitivity. Low-sensitivity tests are comparable to high sensitivity tests in detecting early infections when two assumptions are met: (1) viral load rises quickly (within hours) after infection and (2) viral load reaches and sustains high levels (>10 5 - 10 6 RNA copies/mL). However, there are no human data testing these assumptions. In this study, we document a case of presymptomatic household transmission from a healthy young adult to a sibling and a parent. Participants prospectively provided twice-daily saliva samples. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR and we measured the complete viral load profiles throughout the course of infection of the sibling and parent. This study provides evidence that in at least some human cases of SARS-CoV-2, viral load rises slowly (over days, not hours) and not to such high levels to be detectable reliably by any low-sensitivity test. Additional viral load profiles from different samples types across a broad demographic must be obtained to describe the early phase of infection and determine which testing strategies will be most effective for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection before transmission can occur., One sentence summary: In some human infections, SARS-CoV-2 viral load rises slowly (over days) and remains near the limit of detection of rapid, low-sensitivity tests.	false
0	The accuracy of healthcare worker versus self collected (2-in-1) Oropharyngeal and Bilateral Mid-Turbinate (OPMT) swabs and saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: Self-sampling for SARS-CoV-2 would significantly raise testing capacity and reduce healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to infectious droplets personal, and protective equipment (PPE) use., METHODS: We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 401) and healthy volunteers (n = 100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session., RESULTS: In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the sensitivities of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the sensitivities of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p = 0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p = 0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a sensitivity of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p = 0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The specificity of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%)., CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that sensitivities of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings.	false
0	Decreased serum levels of the inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with non-clinical response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyper-inflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p = 0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p = 0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	IMPACTO DA COVID-19 NA ROTINA DE ATENDIMENTO DO CENTRO DE HEMOTERAPIA E HEMATOLOGIA DO ESPIRITO SANTO - HEMOES. Objetivos: Avaliar o impacto das medidas adotadas pelo Gabinete de Crise COVID-19 do HEMOES para o controle da disseminacao da doenca na instituicao e a manutencao dos atendimentos essenciais e a doacao de sangue. Metodos: Os dados foram organizados em planilhas desenvolvidas e aplicadas durante a pandemia da COVID-19, nos meses de marco a julho do ano corrente, comparados com os dados do mesmo periodo de 2019. As variaveis foram organizadas utilizando o Microsoft Excel e analisadas por meio do software GraphPadPrism V.7.0. Resultados e discussao: Em relacao a doacao de sangue houve reducao do numero de candidatos a doacao, com percentual de queda de marco (25,8%), abril (17,5%), maio (22,9%), junho (12,0%) e julho (27,3%), comprometendo o estoque de seguranca de hemocomponentes. Apesar das medidas adotadas como doacoes agendadas, divulgacao nos meios de comunicacao da SESA e midia local, parceria com aplicativo de transporte, incremento das coletas externas, o estoque de seguranca de hemocomponentes ainda permanece abaixo dos niveis desejados. Sobre a seguranca e saude do trabalhador e usuarios foram feitas diversas notas tecnicas para adequacao de conduta, capacitacoes de biosseguranca para reducao do risco de contagio pelo coronavirus e fornecimento de todos os EPIs necessarios para garantir a manutencao do atendimento com seguranca. Foram afastados 62/192 com sintomas gripais, entretanto apenas 20/62 confirmaram a COVID-19. Outros 10 servidores foram afastados para trabalho remoto. Quanto ao atendimento ambulatorial houve a suspensao de consultas presenciais eletivas de 17 de marco a 15 de julho. Foi implantado o atendimento remoto em 28 de abril e retomado o atendimento presencial limitado a partir de 15 de julho. Com as medidas implantadas no inicio da pandemia houve reducao dos atendimentos em 6,7% em marco e 59,6% em abril. Com a implantacao do atendimento remoto essa reducao foi de 23,4% em maio. Em junho, houve aumento da taxa para 32% devido ao afastamento de um servidor medico por COVID-19, com recuperacao do percentual atendido em julho (30%). Em relacao a manutencao dos insumos criticos, com as acoes adotadas neste periodo nao houve interrupcao dos mesmos, garantindo desta forma o funcionamento da instituicao. Quanto a prevalencia da COVID-19 entre os colaboradores da instituicao, a taxa foi de 10,4% comparado com a do Estado que foi 9,6%. Conclusao: Apesar de o estoque de hemocomponentes estar abaixo do nivel seguro, as acoes implantadas foram essenciais para garantir o atendimento a populacao. Sobre a seguranca da saude do trabalhador e usuarios as capacitacoes foram adequadas para a manutencao de uma prevalencia de contaminacao similar ao Estado. No que diz respeito ao atendimento ambulatorial, a implantacao do atendimento remoto impactou positivamente, evitando desassistencia dos pacientes neste periodo prolongado da pandemia.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical and computed tomography characteristics of COVID-19 associated acute pulmonary embolism: A different phenotype of thrombotic disease?. Background: COVID-19 infections are associated with a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism, particularly pulmonary embolism (PE). It is suggested that COVID-19 associated PE represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism, although the origin of thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. Aim(s): We aimed to determine the clinical and computed tomography (CT) parameters of patients with COVID-19 associated PE. Method(s): We assessed the clinical and CT characteristics of PE in 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute PE before the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, RV/LV diameter ratio, pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load (according to Qanadli) were measured and compared. Result(s): We observed that all thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19. Also, the thrombus load was lower in COVID-19 patients (Qanadli score -8%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -16 to -0.36%) as was the prevalence of the most proximal PE in the main/lobar pulmonary artery (17% versus 47%; -30%, 95% CI -44% to -8.2). Moreover, the mean RV/LV ratio (mean difference -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.07) and the prevalence of RV/LV ratio > 1.0 (prevalence difference -23%, 95% CI -41 to -0.86%) were lower in the COVID-19 patients. Conclusion(s): Our findings therefore suggest that the phenotype of COVID-19 associated PE indeed differs from PE in patients without COVID-19, fuelling the discussion on its pathophysiology.

0	Macrovascular thrombotic events in a mayo clinic enterprise-wide sample of hospitalized COVID-19 positive compared to negative patients. Background: Reports from areas significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have observed high rates of thromboembolic events ranging from (2-69%) but studies have lacked an adequate control population, making interpretations of the results difficult. Aim(s): Determine thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing. Method(s): Adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing by PCR assay were identified through electronic health records across the Mayo Clinic Enterprise (academic and regional hospitals representing different regions of the United States) through 5/8/2020. Thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) were identified from the hospital problem list. Result(s): 3790 patients with admission and COVID-19 testing were identified across 19 different hospitals, among which 102 tested positive. Median age was lower in the COVID positive patients (62 vs 67, p = 0.02; Table 1). Median length of hospitalization was longer in COVID positive patients (9 vs 4 days, p < 0.001) and more required ICU care (57.1% vs 26.7%, p < 0.001). Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy were all observed less frequently with COVID positive admissions (Table 1). Any VTE was identified in 2.9% of COVID positive and 4.6% of COVID negative patients (p = 0.41; Table 2). The frequency of venous and arterial events was not significantlydifferent between the groups. The unadjusted OR for COVID positive patients for any VTE was 0.63 (95% CI 0.19-2.02). In a multivariate logistic regression model evaluating death within 30 days of hospital discharge, neither COVID positivity (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.49-2.11) nor any thromboembolism (aOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.32) was associated with death. Conclusion(s): Early experience with COVID-19 patients across multiple academic and regional hospitals representing different regions of the United States demonstrates a lower than previously reported incidence of thrombotic events in a high-risk cohort, which is not significantly higher than COVID negative hospitalized patients.	false
0	[COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory state in a 15-year-old female patient]. Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Related to SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a rare novel clinical entity observed in children and adolescents with evidence of a recent COVID-19 infection, and is characterized by a marked hyperinflammatory state with involvement of multiple organ systems. We report a case of a previously healthy 15-year-old female patient, who was admitted to paediatric intensive care with cardiac failure and was subsequently shown to have positive COVID-19 serology. The presenting symptoms were fever, cough, chest pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms. She was supported with milrinone and a low dose of vasopressors. Her hyperinflammatory state was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, high dose aspirin and high-dose methylprednisolone. PIMS-TS is a rare, potentially life threatening novel clinical entity in children and adolescents with evidence of a COVID-19 infection. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of this new disease, to ensure prompt recognition and treatment.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Presence in Cerumen. The emergence of a new coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 from China led to a global pandemic. The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The studies of Islamoglu and Hanege evaluated the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions (Cerumen) as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We would like to comment on these 2 studies.	false
0	Understanding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19: Its implication for therapeutic strategy. Although 80% of individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recover without antiviral treatments, the other 20% progress to severe forms of pulmonary disease, suggesting that the host's immune response to the virus could influence the outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial type 2 cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and these infected epithelial cells recruit dendritic cells, neutrophils and monocytes /macrophages, leading to the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These cells launch an antiviral immune response, but are able to completely suppress viral replication or completely eradicate virus in a limited proportion of infected patients. In other patients, viral suppression is incomplete and the numbers of circulating B and T cells are subsequently reduced by as yet unknown mechanisms. Some patients with sustained viral replication progress to a severe condition called cytokine storm. Although antiviral drug(s) should be considered early in infection to prevent progression, there have been no antiviral therapies proven to be effective for significantly inhibiting the viral replication in vivo and suppressing the progression to cytokine storm. Blocking the action of cytokines with dexamethasone or anti-interleukin-6 could have a pivotal role in treatment of those patients. Therapeutic strategy should therefore be based on viral kinetics and the immunopathology of COVID-19. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

0	Is COVID-19 Associated With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms., RESULTS: 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit. Future studies should assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients' mental health. © Copyright 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.	false
0	A case of COVID-19 reinfection in the UK. Protective immunity following COVID-19 infection is not yet fully understood. An understanding of COVID-19 reinfection will be key in guiding government and public health policy decisions in the coming months. This report describes two distinct infective episodes of COVID-19 occurring in the same individual, at the time of writing the first published case in the UK. In April 2020 a 25-year-old UK doctor exhibited classical COVID-19 symptoms, including fevers, headaches, and fatigue. A COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the time returned negative. However, a follow-up antibody test in May 2020 returned positive. In October 2020 the same individual exhibited coryzal symptoms and headaches. He was COVID-19 NAAT tested and found to be positive. There was exposure to high viral load prior to reinfection. Overall the second infection was symptomatically milder, with a faster recovery. This evidence for reinfection poses challenges for public health and vaccination efforts to protect against the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	Risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with viral acute respiratory distress syndrome related or not to Coronavirus 19 disease. BACKGROUND: Data on incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited., METHODS: We conducted a monocenter retrospective study comparing the incidence of VAP and invasive aspergillosis between patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) and those with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral ARDS (NC-ARDS)., RESULTS: We assessed 90 C-ARDS and 82 NC-ARDS patients, who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h. At ICU admission, there were significantly fewer bacterial coinfections documented in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 14 (16%) vs 38 (48%), p < 0.01. Conversely, significantly more patients developed at least one VAP episode in C-ARDS as compared with NC-ARDS: 58 (64%) vs. 36 (44%), p = 0.007. The probability of VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS after adjusting on death and ventilator weaning [sub-hazard ratio = 1.72 (1.14-2.52), p < 0.01]. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR)-related VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 21 (23%) vs. 9 (11%), p = 0.03. Carbapenem was more used in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 48 (53%), vs 21 (26%), p < 0.01. According to AspICU algorithm, there were fewer cases of putative aspergillosis in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS [2 (2%) vs. 12 (15%), p = 0.003], but there was no difference in Aspergillus colonization., CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, we evidenced a higher incidence of VAP and MDR-VAP in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS and a lower risk for invasive aspergillosis in the former group.	false
0	The COVID-19 pandemic and dentistry: the clinical, legal and economic consequences - part 2: consequences of withholding dental care. As routine care was suspended in most countries, one could anticipate progression of undiagnosed and managed oral disease. Patients are usually unaware of the development of oral disease as it is not visible to them and largely asymptomatic, especially in its early stages. The natural progression of conditions such as caries and periodontitis is inevitable without diagnosis and management. The full extent of patient harm because of the suspension of routine dental care can only be estimated when routine oral examinations are fully re-established, and even then, we will probably never know the number of individuals impacted or the extent of disease progression and harm. In first-world countries, there has always been a back-up emergency treatment system for dental problems. For example, in the UK, the safety net for life-threatening swellings and for acute pain relief is the accident and emergency services. This system remained in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Courts could be expected to understand the coronavirus context and would take this into account should there be a complaint against the clinician about access to care. The suspension of routine dental care to save lives will lead to the closure of many dental practices due to substantial financial impact. The return to routine care will be slow, with prioritisation of non-aerosol generating procedures while we look to further understand methods to mitigate transmission risk via infected aerosol and spatter. Inevitably, the cost of personal protective equipment and the lower volume of patients pose a continued threat to businesses.	false
0	Changes in Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels of Subscribers to a Daily Supportive Text Message Program (Text4Hope) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. BACKGROUND: In addition to the obvious physical medical impact of COVID-19, the disease poses evident threats to people's mental health, psychological safety, and well-being. Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. Text4Hope, a daily supportive SMS text messaging program, was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic among Canadians., OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of subscribers to the Text4Hope program after 6 weeks of exposure to daily supportive SMS text messages., METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of Text4Hope subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder, and likely major depressive disorder were assessed using cutoff scores of >=14 for the PSS-10, >=10 for the GAD-7, and >=10 for the PHQ-9, respectively. At 6 weeks into the program, 766 participants had completed the questionnaires at both time points., RESULTS: At the 6-week time point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales but not on the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates of moderate or high stress and likely generalized anxiety disorder but not likely major depressive disorder for the group that completed both the baseline and 6-week assessments. The largest reductions in mean scores and prevalence rates were for anxiety (18.7% and 13.5%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means of implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/19292.

0	Derivation and validation of a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: the PLANS (platelet lymphocyte age neutrophil sex) model. BACKGROUND: Previous published prognostic models for COVID-19 patients have been suggested to be prone to bias due to unrepresentativeness of patient population, lack of external validation, inappropriate statistical analyses, or poor reporting. A high-quality and easy-to-use prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients could support physicians to make better clinical decisions., METHODS: Fine-Gray models were used to derive a prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality (treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event) in COVID-19 patients using two retrospective cohorts (n = 1008) in Wuhan, China from January 1 to February 10, 2020. The proposed model was internally evaluated by bootstrap approach and externally evaluated in an external cohort (n = 1031)., RESULTS: The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted cumulative incidence curves were close to the observed cumulative incidence curves in patients with different risk profiles., CONCLUSIONS: The PLANS model based on five routinely collected predictors would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.	false
0	Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study. Objectives: In addition to risking their physical well-being, frontline physicians are enduring significant emotional burden both at work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak., Methods and design: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)., Results: The survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded PPE, not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID -19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 hours of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models., Conclusions: This study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers., STHRENGHTS & LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY: This study reports a novel and concerning findings on the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms with identification of several important associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional nature of the study design could not establish causal relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This study was carried out by conducting a web-based survey, which might generate sampling bias by excluding the physicians who do not have access to internet or inactive in social medias, and thus limit the generalizability of the findings.	false
0	"High-Dose Cholecalciferol Booster Therapy is Associated with a Reduced Risk of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Multi-Centre Observational Study. The worldwide pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed the most substantial and severe public health issue for several generations, and therapeutic options have not yet been optimised. Vitamin D (in its ""parent"" form, cholecalciferol) has been proposed in the pharmacological management of COVID-19 by various sources. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (ORadj 0.13, 95% CI 0.05-0.35, p < 0.001). This finding was replicated in a validation cohort of 541 patients (ORadj 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.84, p = 0.018). In this observational study, treatment with cholecalciferol booster therapy, regardless of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, appears to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in acute in-patients admitted with COVID-19. Further work with large population studies needs to be carried out to determine adequate serum 25(OH)D levels, as well as multi-dose clinical trials of cholecalciferol therapy to assess maximum efficacy."	false
0	A Patient With Dengue Fever and COVID-19: Coinfection or Not?. Co-epidemics can create a burden on healthcare systems in the affected areas. The world, at present, is facing the pandemic of coronavirus disease. Nonetheless, many areas worldwide suffer from endemics that are not of less danger than the current pandemic. We presented a case of a patient diagnosed with dengue fever and was also found to have coronavirus through nasal swab, but immunoglobulin M and G were undetectable. Our case brings to notice the alarming probability of two co-epidemics happening simultaneously. However, through the presented case, our theory is that the dengue virus may cause a false-positive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

0	Management of STEMI during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned in 2020 to Prepare for 2021. As the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 continues to increase, there is an increasing possibility that patients with COVID-19 may present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With social distancing and restricted access to preventive healthcare and emergency services, the management of acute cardiac emergencies such as myocardial infarction has suffered collateral damage. Thus far, global trends suggest a decrease in STEMI activations with possible worse outcomes due to delayed presentation and management. In this review, we discuss the challenges to STEMI management in the COVID-19 era and provide potential solutions for adherence to evidence-based therapies as the pandemic progresses into the year 2021.

0	"Aerosol Release by Healthy People during Speaking: Possible Contribution to the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our research aimed to review the potential risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. We used an excerpt of a data set generated in May 2020 for reviewing the SARS-CoV-2 prevention concept of orchestras, singers and actors. People were sampled for droplet release for one-hour activities using a Grimm spectrometer covering a spectrum of 1 to 32 microm diameter. We estimated the number of ""quanta"" in the exhaled liquid from viral concentrations of 106 to 1011/mL, based on the Human Infective Dose 50 of 218 viral particles. We employed the Wells-Riley equation to estimate the risk of infection in typical meeting rooms for a one-hour meeting of 2, 4 and 6 people observing a 2 m distance. The four participating adults released a mean of 1.28 nLm3 while breathing, 1.68 nL/m3 while speaking normally, and two adults released a mean of 4.44 nL/m3 while talking with a raised voice. The combination of 50% breathing, 45% talking normally and 5% speaking with a raised voice increased the risk of infection above 5% for a one-hour meeting of two people. The result is based on 6 quanta released, corresponding to an initial virus concentration of 1000/nL (109/mL) in the fluid of the upper respiratory tract. Our data confirm the importance of using facemasks in combination with other measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at the workplace."	false
0	COVID-MATCH65-A prospectively derived clinical decision rule for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. OBJECTIVES: We report on the key clinical predictors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and present a clinical decision rule that can risk stratify patients for COVID-19., DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A prospective cohort of patients assessed for COVID-19 at a screening clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test from nasopharyngeal swab. A backwards stepwise logistic regression was used to derive a model of clinical variables predictive of a positive COVID-19 test. Internal validation of the final model was performed using bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients, with modelling performed for increasing prevalence., RESULTS: Of 4226 patients with suspected COVID-19 who were assessed, 2976 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing (n = 108 SARS-CoV-2 positive) and were used to determine factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test. The 7 features associated with a positive COVID-19 test on multivariable analysis were: COVID-19 patient exposure or international travel, Myalgia/malaise, Anosmia or ageusia, Temperature, Coryza/sore throat, Hypoxia-oxygen saturation < 97%, 65 years or older-summarized in the mnemonic COVID-MATCH65. Internal validation showed an AUC of 0.836. A cut-off of >= 1.5 points was associated with a 92.6% sensitivity and 99.5% negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: From the largest prospective outpatient cohort of suspected COVID-19 we define the clinical factors predictive of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The subsequent clinical decision rule, COVID-MATCH65, has a high sensitivity and NPV for SARS-CoV-2 and can be employed in the pandemic, adjusted for disease prevalence, to aid COVID-19 risk-assessment and vital testing resource allocation.	false
0	Impact of chronic liver disease upon admission on COVID-19 in-hospital mortality: Findings from COVOCA study. BACKGROUND: Italy has been the first Western country to be heavily affected by the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection and among the pioneers of the clinical management of pandemic. To improve the outcome, identification of patients at the highest risk seems mandatory., OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study is to identify comorbidities and clinical conditions upon admission associated with in-hospital mortality in several COVID Centers in Campania Region (Italy)., METHODS: COVOCA is a multicentre retrospective observational cohort study, which involved 18 COVID Centers throughout Campania Region, Italy. Data were collected from patients who completed their hospitalization between March-June 2020. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality, assessed either from data at discharge or death certificate, whilst all exposure variables were collected at hospital admission., RESULTS: Among 618 COVID-19 hospitalized patients included in the study, 143 in-hospital mortality events were recorded, with a cumulative incidence of about 23%. At multivariable logistic analysis, male sex (OR 2.63, 95%CI 1.42-4.90; p = 0.001), Chronic Liver Disease (OR 5.88, 95%CI 2.39-14.46; p<0.001) and malignancies (OR 2.62, 95%CI 1.21-5.68; p = 0.015) disclosed an independent association with a poor prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Respiratory Severity Scale allowed to identify at higher mortality risk. Sensitivity analysis further enhanced these findings., CONCLUSION: Mortality of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 appears strongly affected by both clinical conditions on admission and comorbidities. Originally, we observed a very poor outcome in subjects with a chronic liver disease, alongside with an increase of hepatic damage.	false

In this work we present the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 1.5-year-old boy affected by severe Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome with previous history of autoinflammatory disease, occurring 5 months after treatment with gene therapy. Before SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient had obtained engraftment of gene corrected cells, resulting in WASP expression restoration and early immune reconstitution. The patient produced specific immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 at high titer with neutralizing capacity and experienced a mild course of infection, with limited inflammatory complications, despite pre-gene therapy clinical phenotype.

0	Dynamics and Correlation Among Viral Positivity, Seroconversion, and Disease Severity in COVID-19 : A Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND: The understanding of viral positivity and seroconversion during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited., OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and evaluate their correlations with seroconversion and disease severity., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: 3 designated specialty care centers for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China., PARTICIPANTS: 3192 adult patients with COVID-19., MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data., RESULTS: Among 12 780 reverse transcriptase PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that were done, 24.0% had positive results. In 2142 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the viral positivity rate peaked within the first 3 days. The median duration of viral positivity was 24.0 days (95% CI, 18.9 to 29.1 days) in critically ill patients and 18.0 days (CI, 16.8 to 19.1 days) in noncritically ill patients. Being critically ill was an independent risk factor for longer viral positivity (hazard ratio, 0.700 [CI, 0.595 to 0.824]; P < 0.001). In patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the IgM-positive rate was 19.3% in the first week, peaked in the fifth week (81.5%), and then decreased steadily to around 55% within 9 to 10 weeks. The IgG-positive rate was 44.6% in the first week, reached 93.3% in the fourth week, and then remained high. Similar antibody responses were seen in clinically diagnosed cases. Serum inflammatory markers remained higher in critically ill patients. Among noncritically ill patients, a higher proportion of those with persistent viral positivity had low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) during the entire course compared with those with short viral positivity., LIMITATION: Retrospective study and irregular viral and serology testing., CONCLUSION: The rate of viral PCR positivity peaked within the initial few days. Seroconversion rates peaked within 4 to 5 weeks. Dynamic laboratory index changes corresponded well to clinical signs, the recovery process, and disease severity. Low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) are an independent risk factor for persistent viral positivity., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.	false
0	Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests with different antigen targets. BACKGROUND: These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests available in April 2020 in Switzerland., METHODS: In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other viruses., RESULTS: In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, five had a sensitivity and specificity above 90 % and 98 % respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no test showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the evaluated tests exhibited high performances of IgG/pan-Ig sensitivity and specificity to detect the serological response of moderately to critically ill hospitalized patients. The IgM and IgA tests showed mostly insufficient performances with no added value for the early diagnostic on the cohort tested in this study. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	"The Kids Are Not Alright: A Preliminary Report of Post-COVID Syndrome in University Students. Background: Post-COVID syndrome is increasingly recognized by the medical community but has not been studied exclusively in young adults. This preliminary report investigates the prevalence and features of protracted symptoms in non-hospitalized university students who experienced mild-to-moderate acute illness., Methods: 148 students completed an online study to earn research credit for class. Data from COVID-19 positive participants with symptoms >=28 days (N=22) were compared to those who fully recovered (N=21) and those not diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=58)., Results: 51% of participants who contracted COVID-19 (N=43) experienced symptoms >=28 days and were classified as having post-COVID syndrome; all but one (96%) were female. During acute illness the post-COVID group, compared to those who fully recovered, experienced significantly more chest pain (64% vs 14%; P=.002), fatigue (86% vs 48%; P=.009), fever (82% vs 48%; P=.02), olfactory impairment (82% vs 52%; P=.04), headaches (32% vs 5%; P<.05), and diarrhea (32% vs 5%; P<.05). Compared to those not diagnosed with COVID-19, the post-COVID syndrome group more frequently experienced exercise intolerance (43% vs. 0%; P<.001), dyspnea (43% vs. 0%; P<.001), chest pain (31% vs 7%; P=.002), olfactory impairment (19% vs 0%; P=.004), lymphadenopathy (19% vs 0%; P=.004), gustatory impairment (14% vs 0%; P=.02), and appetite loss (36% vs 14%; P=.02)., Interpretation: Our results contradict the perception that this ""yet to be defined"" post-COVID syndrome predominantly affects middle-aged adults and suggest that exercise intolerance, dyspnea, chest pain, chemosensory impairment, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis, and appetite loss may differentiate post-COVID syndrome from general symptoms of pandemic, age, and academic related stress. These findings are also consistent with previous reports that females are more vulnerable to this post viral syndrome. Large-scale population-based studies are essential to discerning the magnitude and characterization of post-COVID syndrome in young adults as well as more diverse populations."	false
0	The coronavirus crisis and the technology sector. The coronavirus crisis has created a profound shift in how people interact and economies function. Policy mandates and fears of becoming infected or infecting others have impelled populations to shelter at home, socially distance, and otherwise reduce direct, in-person interactions with others. By enabling people to conduct many regular activities remotely, including working, learning, shopping, and receiving medical services, technology has allowed the continuation of some semblance of a normal lifestyle in this new environment. Within this context, the IT sector has provided the tools and resources required to support these remote activities, as well as to address the pandemic more directly through efforts such as supporting contact tracing and providing high-performance computing resources for COVID-19-related research. This paper discusses in more detail this impact of the pandemic on the technology industry, and its response to this shock, by addressing three elements: accelerated digital transformation, increased importance of technology in the economy and society, and prevalence of inequalities in access to and the use of technology.

Increasing evidence demonstrated that the expression of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is a necessary step for SARS-CoV-2 infection permissiveness. In light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyze ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. Using multiple reagents and antibodies, we showed that ACE2 is expressed in human pancreatic islets, where it is preferentially expressed in subsets of insulin producing beta-cells. ACE2 is also highly expressed in pancreas microvasculature pericytes and moderately expressed in rare scattered ductal cells. By using different ACE2 antibodies we showed that a recently described short-ACE2 isoform is also prevalently expressed in human beta-cells. Finally, using RT-qPCR, RNA-seq and High-Content imaging screening analysis, we demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not palmitate, increase ACE2 expression in the beta-cell line EndoC-betaH1 and in primary human pancreatic islets. Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes through putative infection of pancreatic microvasculature and/or ductal cells and/or through direct beta-cell virus tropism.

0	Dysregulated ACE2 and Furin Activity amongst Smokers Increase Disease Susceptibility Towards SARS-CoV2. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has brought infected millions worldwide. Over 6 million individuals in the US have been infected by the SARS-CoV2 making it the worst-hit country across the globe. While there is an urgent need to find a potential therapy/vaccine it is important to understand the disease progression and susceptibilities to enable better the disease management. In this respect, smokers or vapers could be considered as the worst affected population as they are highly prone to respiratory infections. However, the clinical data relating COVID-19 occurrence and severity amongst smokers/vapers is quite limited. We thus hypothesized that dysregulated ACE2 expression and weakened immunity could result in severe disease outcomes amongst smokers. To test this hypothesis, we collected the blood serum samples from COVID19 positive and COVID-19 recovered patients with and without a smoking history. We assayed the expression and activity of ACE2. ACE2 is the membrane-bound receptor on pneumocytes and lung epithelium that binds to the SARS-CoV2 spike protein and is responsible for the viral entry into the host cell. This viral entry and fusion occur due to the activity of membrane proteases like furin and TMPRSS2. Result(s): Our initial investigations show increased Furin activity amongst the COVID19 positive patients with a smoking history as compared to the non-smoking controls. We further observed a significant dysregulation in the ACE2 activity of COVID-19 patients as compared to COVID-19 recovered patient group. Smoking habit was found to dramatically affect the ACE2 activity amongst COVID-19 positive group. We are presently comparing the expression levels of systemic inflammatory mediators (IL8 and IL6) amongst our various experimental groups to compare the severity of inflammatory responses amongst smokers and non-smokers. Overall, our findings show that the onset and progression of COVID-19 varies amongst smokers doi: xxxxxCopyright © 2020	false
0	Ecg changes in a patient with covid-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The study involved a 73-year old patient admitted to our hospital with moderate COVID-19 infection detected during acute coronary syndrome. The patient underwent revascularization using stenting of the circumflex artery eight hours after onset of chest pain. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes treated with Metformin and high blood pressure treated with perindopril. At first he underwent ECG showing QTc level of 420 ms (corrected according to Bazett's formula). He received hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times a day and azithromycin 500 mg/day according to Moroccan COVID-19 treatment protocol in addition to his post-infarct treatment (Clopidogrel 1 tablet of 75 mg once a day; aspirin 1 tablet of 75 mg once a day; atorvastatin 1 tablet of 80 mg once a day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day. On the 5th day of his hospitalization daily ECG monitoring showed QT interval prolongation of 547 ms (corrected according to Bazett's formula) with ventricular extrasystole (ECG A) justifying discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment. Three hours after, another ECG was performed which showed focal atrial tachycardia with variable conduction and unchanged QTc (ECG B). No hydroelectrolyte imbalance associated with serum potassium 4.1 mmol/l and magnesemia 22mmol/l was detected. Outcome was favorable with QT returning to normal values, patient's transition to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation requiring oral anticoagulation therapy and discharge after 21 days of hospitalization.Copyright © Mohamed Elghali Benouna et al.	false
0	"Effects of Public Health Interventions on Hospital Utilization in Patients with COVID-19: a Comparative Study. BACKGROUND: Different states in the U.S. had different nonpharmaceutical public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of those interventions on hospital utilization have not been systematically evaluated. The investigation could provide data-driven evidence to potentially improve the implementation of public health interventions in the future., OBJECTIVE: We study two representative areas in the U.S. and one area in China, New York State, Ohio State, and Hubei Province, and investigate the effects of their public health interventions by time-periods according to key interventions., METHODS: This observational study evaluated the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and death cases in New York and Ohio from March 16 through September 14, and Hubei from January 26 to March 31, 2020. We developed novel Bayesian generalized compartmental models. The clinical stages of COVID-19 were stratified in the models, and the effects of public health interventions were modeled through piecewise exponential functions. Time-dependent transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers were estimated. The associations of interventions and the numbers of required hospital and ICU beds were studied., RESULTS: The interventions of social distancing, home confinement, and wearing masks significantly decreased (in a Bayesian sense) the case incidence and reduced the demand for beds in all areas. Ohio's transmission rates declined before the state's ""stay at home"" order, which provided evidence that early intervention is important. Wearing masks was significantly associated with reducing the transmission rates after reopening, when comparing New York and Ohio. The centralized quarantine intervention in Hubei played a significant role in further preventing and controlling the disease in that area. The estimated rates that cured patients become susceptible in all areas were very small (<0.0001), which indicates that they have little chance to get the infection again., CONCLUSIONS: The series of public health interventions in three areas were temporally associated with the burden of COVID-19-attributed hospital utilization. Social distancing and the use of face masks should continue to prevent the next peak of the pandemic., CLINICALTRIAL:"	false
0	COVID-19 therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and convalescent plasma must consider exosome involvement: Do the exosomes in convalescent plasma antagonize the weak immune antibodies?. Exosome extracellular vesicles as biologic therapy for COVID-19 are discussed for two areas. The first involves the growing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the profound clinical cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Instead, it is recommended to treat alternatively with their MSC-released exosomes. This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID-19, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID-19 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID-19 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus. There is sufficient evidence, like recovery of patients with antibody deficiencies, to postulate that the antibodies actually have little effect and that immune resistance is principally due to T cell mechanisms. Further, COVID-19 convalescent plasma has remarkably weak beneficial effects if compared to what was expected from many prior studies. This may be due to the dysfunctional immune response to the infection and resulting weak Ab that may be impaired further by antagonistic exosomes in the convalescent plasma. At the least, pre selection of plasma for the best antibodies and relevant exosomes would produce the most optimum therapy for very severely affected COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV2: updated rapid review. Background: Understanding carriage and transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in children is of paramount importance to understand the spread of virus in school and community settings., Methods: We performed an updated rapid review to investigate the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for five categories and results are reported narratively., Results: A total of 33 new studies were included for this review. We did not identify additional studies that reported documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children. We identified 15 new studies that demonstrate children's susceptibility and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with evidence provided on the chance of being index or secondary cases, the potential of faecal-oral transmission, and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. There were three studies reporting COVID-19 school outbreaks in France (Oise), Australia (New South Wales) and Israel. The remaining four studies found that all reported cases did not infect any other pupils or staff. With data from seven studies and governmental websites, the proportion of children among all confirmed COVID-19 patients was estimated for 29 countries, varying from 0.3% (lowest in Spain) up to 13.8% (highest in Argentina). Lastly, we identified seven studies reporting on PIMS-TS linked to COVID-19 among paediatric patients., Conclusions: There is somewhat limited evidence available for quantifying the extent to which children may contribute to overall transmission, but the balance of evidence so far suggests that children and schools play only a limited role in overall transmission.

0	Association of climatic factors with COVID-19 in Pakistan. Introduction: Environmental factors such as wind, temperature, humidity, and sun exposure are known to affect influenza and viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions. COVID-19 is a new pandemic with very little information available about its transmission and association with environmental factors. The goal of this paper is to explore the association of environmental factors on daily incidence rate, mortality rate, and recoveries of COVID-19., Methods: The environmental data for humidity, temperature, wind, and sun exposure were recorded from metrological websites and COVID-19 data such as the daily incidence rate, death rate, and daily recovery were extracted from the government's official website available to the general public. The analysis for each outcome was adjusted for factors such as lock down status, nationwide events, and the number of daily tests performed. Analysis was completed with negative binominal regression log link using generalised linear modelling., Results: Daily temperature, sun exposure, wind, and humidity were not significantly associated with daily incidence rate. Temperature and nationwide social gatherings, although non-significant, showed trends towards a higher chance of incidence. An increase in the number of daily testing was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 incidences (effect size ranged from 2.17-9.96). No factors were significantly associated with daily death rates. Except for the province of Balochistan, a lower daily temperature was associated with a significantly higher daily recovery rate., Discussion: Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and daily sun exposure were not consistently associated with COVID-19 incidence, death rates, or recovery. More policing about precautionary measures and ensuring diagnostic testing and accuracy are needed. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.	false
0	Novel Molecular Evidence Related to COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially compromises their innate immune system. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the affected cell. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia-induced glycosylation of ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the binding of S protein to ACE2, enabling viral entry. Downregulation of ACE2 activity secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II and metabolites, eventually leads to poor outcomes. The altered binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the compromised innate immunity of patients with DM increase their susceptibility to COVID-19; COVID-19 induces pancreatic beta-cell injury and poor glycemic control, which further compromises the immune response and aggravates hyperglycemia and COVID-19 progression, forming a vicious cycle. Sequential cleavage of viral S protein by furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers viral entry to release the viral genome into the target cell. Hence, TMPRSS2 and furin are possible drug targets. As type 1 DM exhibits a Th1-driven autoimmune process, the relatively lower mortality of COVID-19 in type 1 DM compared to type 2 DM might be attributed to an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 immunity. The anti-inflammatory effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor may benefit patients with DM and COVID-19. The potential protective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), including reduction in lactate level, prevention of lowering of cytosolic pH and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may justify the provision of SGLT2i to patients with DM and mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. For patients with DM and COVID-19 who require hospitalization, insulin-based treatment is recommended with cessation of metformin and SGLT2i. Further evidence from randomized or case-control clinical trials is necessary to elucidate the effectiveness and pitfalls of different types of medication for DM.	false
0	Increased Prevalence of Face Mask-Induced Itch in Health Care Workers. BACKGROUND: Face mask use has increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers (HCW) wear masks for prolonged periods and are prone to adverse effects. Very little is known about face-mask-associated itch., METHODS: This Internet survey study investigated the prevalence, intensity and clinical characteristics of itch related to the use of face masks by HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were subsequently compared to the students' group., RESULTS: A total of 1156 HCW completed the survey. Among them, 31.6% (365) reported suffering from itch associated with face mask use. Itch was more frequent among females. Moreover, subjects who reported sensitive skin, atopic predispositions and facial dermatoses tended to report itch more frequently. The worst case of itch in the seven days prior to the study, assessed with the numeric rating scale (NRS), was 4.6 +/- 2.0 points. Itch prevalence increased along with the duration of face mask use, being 34.6% among those who wore masks for more than 4 h. HCW reported itch significantly more frequently than students., CONCLUSIONS: Face-mask-associated itch is a frequent problem among HCW in the COVID-19 pandemic. Itch sensation may cause scratching, which may decrease necessary protection during the pandemic.	false
0	Dyspnoea, lung function and CT findings three months after hospital admission for COVID-19. The long-term pulmonary outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unknown. We aimed to describe self-reported dyspnoea, quality of life, pulmonary function, and chest CT findings three months following hospital admission for COVID-19. We hypothesised outcomes to be inferior for patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), compared with non-ICU patients.Discharged COVID-19-patients from six Norwegian hospitals were consecutively enrolled in a prospective cohort study. The current report describes the first 103 participants, including 15 ICU patients. Modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC), EuroQol Group's Questionnaire, spirometry, diffusion capacity (DLCO), six-minute walk test, pulse oximetry, and low-dose CT scan were performed three months after discharge.mMRC was >0 in 54% and >1 in 19% of the participants. The median (25th-75th percentile) forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second were 94% (76, 121) and 92% (84, 106) of predicted, respectively. DLCO was below the lower limit of normal in 24%. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) with >10% distribution in >=1 of 4 pulmonary zones were present in 25%, while 19% had parenchymal bands on chest CT. ICU survivors had similar dyspnoea scores and pulmonary function as non-ICU patients, but higher prevalence of GGO (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 4.2 [1.1, 15.6]) and performance in lower usual activities.Three months after admission for COVID-19, one fourth of the participants had chest CT opacities and reduced diffusion capacity. Admission to ICU was associated with pathological CT findings. This was not reflected in increased dyspnoea or impaired lung function. Copyright ©ERS 2020.	false
0	COVID-19 Test Strategy to Guide Quarantine Interval in University Student. BACKGROUND: Following COVID-19 exposure, the CDC recommends a 10-14 day quarantine for asymptomatic individuals and more recently a 7 day quarantine with a negative PCR test. We performed a university-based prospective student cohort study to determine if early PCR negativity predicts day 14 negativity., METHODS: We enrolled 101 asymptomatic, quarantining, students, performed nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing on days 3 or 4, 5, 7, 10 and 14 and determined the proportion of concordant negative results for each day versus day 14 with a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval., RESULTS: Overall, 14 of 90 (16%, 95% CI: 9% - 25%) tested positive while in quarantine, with 7 initial positive tests on day 3 or 4, 5 on day 5, 2 on day 7, and none on day 10 or 14. Rates of concordant negative test results are: day 5 vs. day 14 = 45/50 (90%, 95% CI: 78% - 97%); day 7 vs. day 14 = 47/52 (90%, 95% CI: 79% - 97%); day 10 vs. day 14 = 48/53 (91%, 95% CI:79% - 97%), with no evidence of different negative rates between earlier days and day 14 by McNemar's test, p > 0.05., CONCLUSIONS: The 16% positive rate supports the ongoing need to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases, but this prospective study provides the first direct evidence that exposed asymptomatic students ages 18-44 years in a university setting are at low risk if released from quarantine at 7 days if they test negative PCR test prior to release.	false
0	A case of area postrema variant of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a disabling autoimmune astrocytopathic channelopathy, characterized by the presence of pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channels. Several viral infections including HIV, influenza virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein Barr virus, among others, have been alleged to trigger NMOSD in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have been ever evolving and the spectrum of neuraxial involvement is broadening. Albeit it may affect any area of the neural axis, the involvement of the spinal cord is rare compared to that of the brain and of the peripheral nervous system. Cases with acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) have been recently reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection but did not fulfill the international consensus diagnostic criteria for NMOSD. AQP-4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD following SARS-CoV-2 infection had not yet been reported. We herein report a novel case of a previously healthy man who presented with a clinical picture of bouts of vomiting and hiccoughs (area postrema syndrome), which rapidly evolved to acute LETM, all following SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was finally diagnosed to be a case of seropositive NMOSD which presented as area postrema syndrome. The response to immunomodulatory drugs was excellent. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Correlation of subway turnstile entries and COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in New York City. In this paper, we show a strong correlation between turnstile entries data of the New York City (NYC) subway provided by NYC Metropolitan Transport Authority and COVID-19 deaths and cases reported by the NYC Department of Health from March to May 2020. This correlation is obtained through linear regression and confirmed through the prediction of the number of deaths by a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. The correlation is significantly accentuated through the consideration of incubation and symptomatic phases of this disease as experienced by people who died from it. We extend the analysis to each individual NYC borough. We also estimate the dates when the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases would approach zero by using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model on the reported deaths and cases. We also backward forecast the dates when the first cases and deaths may have occurred. Copyright .	false
0	Biochemical and antigenic characterization of the structural proteins and their post-translational modifications in purified SARS-CoV-2 virions of an inactivated vaccine candidate. In the face of COVID-19 pandemic caused by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, an inactivated, Vero cell-based, whole virion vaccine candidate has been developed and entered into phase III clinical trials within six months. Biochemical and immunogenic characterization of structural proteins and their post-translational modifications in virions, the end-products of the vaccine candidate, would be essential for the quality control and process development of vaccine products and for studying the immunogenicity and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. By using a panel of rabbit antisera against virions and five structural proteins together with a convalescent serum, the spike (S) glycoprotein was shown to be N-linked glycosylated, PNGase F-sensitive, endoglycosidase H-resistant and cleaved by Furin-like proteases into S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S and S1/S2 subunits could form homodimers/trimers. The membrane (M) protein was partially N-linked glycosylated; the accessory protein 3a existed in three different forms, indicative of cleavage and dimerization. Furthermore, analysis of the antigenicity of these proteins and their post-translationally modified forms demonstrated that S protein induced the strongest antibody response in both convalescent and immunized animal sera. Interestingly, immunization with the inactivated vaccine did not elicit antibody response against the S2 subunit, whereas strong antibody response against both S1 and S2 subunits was detected in the convalescent serum. Moreover, vaccination stimulated stronger antibody response against S multimers than did the natural infection. This study revealed that the native S glycoprotein stimulated neutralizing antibodies, while bacterially-expressed S fragments did not. The study on S modifications would facilitate design of S-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection in a Child Presenting With Functional Intestinal Obstruction. This report describes the case of a 13-year-old male patient presenting with functional small bowel obstruction. The child was also observed to have persistent tachycardia, and repeat cardiac examination revealed a new-onset cardiac murmur and a gallop rhythm. Acute viral myocarditis was clinically suspected, prompting further cardiac evaluations including electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (echo), and cardiac enzyme panel. Both EKG and echo findings suggested acute myocardial injury, in addition to elevated levels of cardiac enzymes and other inflammatory markers. Considering the ongoing pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was suspected, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Because multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may occur later in the course of COVID-19 illness, a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was performed, with positive results. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of COVID-19 presenting as functional intestinal obstruction. We present this case to share our findings on this unique manifestation of COVID-19 with pediatric colleagues. We also engage in a brief review of MIS-C. Copyright © 2020, Alsabri et al.	false
0	Evaluation of hand hygiene and onset of hand eczema after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Munich. BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, authorities have preached the importance of personal hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the frequency of hand washing and hand care, the onset of hand eczema (HE) and risk factors associated with HE since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Munich in January 2020., MATERIALS & METHODS: All dermatologic outpatients at the university hospital between April 6 and April 19 were asked to complete a structured questionnaire., RESULTS: Data of 512 patients with a median age of 49 years (243 females, 267 males) were analysed. The frequency of hand washing and hand disinfection increased after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001, respectively). While symptoms associated with HE were reported by 29.9% (149/499) of patients, the actual diagnosis of HE was reported less frequently by 11.2% (53/473) with a median duration of 120 days. Frequent hand disinfection (p = 0.039), atopic dermatitis (p = 0.006) and young age (p = 0.0499) were identified as risk factors for symptoms of HE. Hand care was performed more frequently during the pandemic than before (p < 0.001). A high frequency of hand care during the pandemic was not significantly associated with symptoms of HE (p = 0.172), but was associated with self-recognition of HE symptoms (p = 0.002)., CONCLUSION: After the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the frequency of hand hygiene measures increased. A considerably high prevalence of HE symptoms was associated with frequent hand disinfection, atopic dermatitis and young age. Awareness of HE should be raised in order for preventive measures to be taken earlier.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on activity patterns and weight status among youths in China: the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS). Lockdown measures including school closures due to COVID-19 may affect youths' activity patterns and obesity status. This will be for the first time examined in China in this study on the basis of a large national sample from the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS). Through an online questionnaire, 10,082 participants from high schools, colleges, and graduate schools, aged 19.8 +/- 2.3 years, voluntarily reported their lifestyles and weight status before (January 2020) and after lockdown (April-May 2020). The significance of these changes was assessed between sexes and across education levels. We found that the youths' average body mass index significantly increased from 21.8 to 22.1 kg/m2, with the prevalences of overweight/obesity and obesity increasing from 21.4% to 24.6% and from 10.5% to 12.6%, respectively. Also, significant decreases were seen in the frequency of engaging in active transport, moderate-/vigorous-intensity housework, leisure-time moderate-/vigorous-intensity physical activity, and leisure-time walking, while significant increases were observed in the average sedentary time during workdays and weekends, the average sleeping time during workdays and weekends, and screen time. Our findings would serve as important evidence for shaping global strategies to counteract or reverse the lockdown effects on youths' obesity.	false
0	COVID-19 Pandemic and Thalassemia Major Patients: Transfusion Practice and Treatment Assessment. BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 epidemic occurred for the first time in December 2019, the governments worldwide took some restriction measures for slowing the spread of novel coronavirus. Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated., RESULTS: In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.9+/-6.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.14+/-0.77 g/dL and 8.87+/- 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients., CONCLUSION: Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided. The results of the SF level showed that the management of chelation therapy should be more meticulous. However, we should be ready for the challenges in the transfusion practice of patients with TM due to fluctuations in the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Retrospective Analysis of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients Presenting to Emergency Department. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases incidentally diagnosed at the emergency department., METHODOLOGY: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of patients who presented to emergency department, between March 1 - May 1, 2020, without COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia on admission but were incidentally detected to have thoracic computerized tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19. The patients' sociodemographic and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory test results, clinical and radiological findings, treatment protocols, and prognoses were recorded., RESULTS: We incidentally diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia in 81 asymptomatic patients. All patients presented to emergency department with traumatic injuries. Of these, 38 (46%) were injured in in-vehicle traffic accidents; 27 (34%) out-of-vehicle traffic accidents; 14 (18%) simple falls; and 2 (2%) falls from a height. Only 42 (48%) patients had a history of suspected contact with a COVID-19 positive individual. The mean time to symptom onset of 81 patients was 5+/-2 days. An analysis based on thoracic computerized tomography findings showed that the common finding found in all patients was ground glass opacity (GGO). While 55 (68%) patients had GGO alone, 10 (12%) had additional fine reticulations; 6 (7%) had an additional halo sign; 6 (7%) had an additional air bronchogram; and 4 (5%) had an additional area of consolidation. None of the patients died during follow-up, and all of them were discharged., CONCLUSION: Early identification and isolation of asymptomatic patients is of great importance for reducing the speed of propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidentally diagnosed cases have made us to consider that there is a need to increase the number of screening tests. We also believe that healthcare staff should suspect COVID-19 pneumonia in every patient irrespective presentation type, place importance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and not examine any patient without wearing PPE.

0	Association of PTSD with COVID-19 testing and infection in the Veterans Health Administration. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity. Associations between PTSD and COVID-19 outcomes may affect Veterans Health Administration (VA) services, as PTSD occurs at higher rates among veterans than the general population. While previous research has identified the potential for increased PTSD prevalence resulting from COVID-19 as a public health concern, no known research examines the effect of pre-existing PTSD on COVID-19 test-seeking behavior or infection. This study aimed to evaluate pre-existing PTSD as a predictor of COVID-19 testing and test positivity. The sample consisted of 6,721,407 veterans who sought VA care between March 1, 2018 and February 29, 2020. Veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were more likely to receive COVID-19 testing than veterans without PTSD. However, among those with available COVID-19 test results (n = 168,032), veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were less likely to test positive than veterans without PTSD. Elevated COVID-19 testing rates among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased COVID-19 health concerns and/or hypervigilance. Lower rates of COVID-19 test positivity among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased social isolation, or overrepresentation in the tested population due to higher overall use of VA services. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the identification of patient-level psychiatric predictors of testing and test positivity can facilitate the targeted provision of medical and mental health services to individuals in need.

0	Corona Virus Disease 2019 patients with different disease severity or age range: A single-center study of clinical features and prognosis. This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and prognosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and to compare these features among COVID-19 patients with different disease severity or age range.Totally, 129 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled, and the information about demographics, comorbidities, medical histories, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings at the time of hospital admission were collected. Meanwhile, their clinical outcomes were recorded. According to the fourth version of the guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China, patients were divided into subgroups according to disease severity (moderate and severe/critical) or age (<40 years, 40-64 years and >=65 years). In total patients, the most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough (all incidences over 50%). Other common clinical symptoms included tiredness/anorexia, shortness of breath, dyspnea, aching pain, expectoration, diarrhea, shivering, and nausea/vomiting. The mortality rate was 5.4%, and the median value of hospital stay was 16.0 (11.0-23.0) days. Subgroup analyses disclosed that severe/critical patients exhibited increased neutrophil count, neutrophils, C-reactive protein, calcitonin, alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, and more deaths compared with that in moderate patients. Regarding age, it correlated with more common fever, higher levels of red blood cell, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, red cell volume distribution width standard deviation-coefficient of variation, calcitonin, alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and D-dimer, raised death rate and prolonged hospital stay.Our findings provide valuable evidence regarding clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients to help with the understanding of the disease and prognosis improvement.	false
0	Prevalence and clinical correlates of dementia among COVID-19-related deaths in Italy. Introduction: We aimed at exploring the proportion of patients dying with COVID-19 and concomitant dementia in Italy, as well as their clinical characteristics and trajectories of care., Methods: The proportion of COVID-19-related deaths occurring in people with dementia and the clinical characteristics of deceased individuals according to their dementia status were explored by considering the medical charts of a representative sample of patients deceased in Italian hospitals (n = 2621)., Results: A total of 415 individuals with dementia were identified in the study population, accounting for 15.8% of overall COVID-19-related deaths. Patients with dementia less frequently presented with cough, had lower chance of receiving supportive therapies and intensive care approaches, and showed a faster clinical worsening as compared with individuals with intact cognition., Discussion: Dementia confers a relevant risk of adverse outcomes in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and influences the clinical presentation, course and management of affected individuals.

0	Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Progressive and Non-progressive Coronavirus Disease 2019: Evidence From 365 Hospitalised Patients in Honghu and Nanchang, China. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept around the globe and led to a worldwide catastrophe. Studies examining the disease progression of patients with non-severe disease on admission are scarce but of profound importance in the early identification of patients at a high risk of deterioration. Objective(s): To elucidate the differences in clinical characteristics between patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for disease progression. Study design: Clinical data of 365 patients with non-severe COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 18 March 2020 were retrospectively collected. Patients were stratified into progressive and non-progressive disease groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors for disease progression. Result(s): Compared with patients with non-progressive disease, those who progressed to severe COVID-19 were older and had significantly decreased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts; increased neutrophil and platelet counts; lower albumin levels; higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, creatinine kinase, and urea nitrogen; and longer prothrombin times. Hypertension, fever, fatigue, anorexia, bacterial coinfection, bilateral patchy shadowing, antibiotic and corticosteroid administration, and oxygen support had a significantly higher incidence among patients with progressive disease. A significantly longer duration of hospital stay was also observed in patients with progressive disease. Bilateral patchy shadowing (OR = 4.82, 95% CI: 1.33-17.50; P = 0.017) and elevated levels of creatinine (OR =6.24, 95% CI: 1.42-27.40; P = 0.015), and CRP (OR = 7.28, 95% CI: 2.56-20.74; P < 0.001) were independent predictors for disease progression. Conclusion(s): The clinical characteristics of patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 were significantly different. Bilateral patchy shadowing and increased levels of creatinine, and CRP were independent predictors of disease progression.© Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Xiao, Li, Zhu, Hu, Zhang, Sun, Shen, Liu, Zhang, Zeng, Gong, Liu, He and Zhu.	false
0	Extensive DVT and Pulmonary Embolism Leading to the Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Absence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pneumonia. There is growing evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state. To date, all patients reported with venous thromboembolic disease and COVID-19 have shown evidence of viral pneumonia. Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old patient with unexplained extensive DVT and bilateral pulmonary embolism in the absence of COVID-19 pneumonia, leading to the diagnosis of otherwise asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the high rates of otherwise asymptomatic patients, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in all patients with unexplained VTE occurring in COVID-19-endemic areas, even in the absence of other disease manifestations suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

0	Angiotensin converting enzyme genotypes and mortality from COVID-19: An ecological study. Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes are known to be associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and resultant mortality. In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. Method(s): We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. Result(s): The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5-41.2, p = 0.2). Conclusion(s): Distribution frequency of ACE insertion/insertion (II) genotype may have a significant influence on COVID-19 mortality. This information has potential utility for resource planning at a systemic level, as well as for clinical management.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Unusual association of COVID-19, pulmonary tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus, having progressed favorably under treatment with chloroquine and rifampin. Infection with the new coronavirus has been declared an international health emergency. Its curative treatment is unknown and is the subject of several clinical trials. In addition, the concomitant association of COVID-19 with tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus, hitherto never described, is potentially fatal. We report the illustrative case of a 32-year-old patient who presented this trifecta of infections and who did well under treatment with chloroquine and anti-mycobacterial drugs. This patient arrived at the ER with respiratory discomfort that had been evolving over a month with symptoms of flu and deterioration of her general condition. A chest CT scan revealed an aspect of lung miliary tuberculosis with isolation of Koch's bacilli in the sputum. A polymerization chain reaction (PCR) was positive for COVID-19 on a nasopharyngeal swab. HIV serology was positive. The course was marked by a spectacular clinical improvement and two negative COVID-19 PCR controls at the end of treatment (at days 9 and 10). Anti-tubercular drugs (especially, rifampin) are powerful enzyme inducers that can reduce the effectiveness of chloroquine in our patient. This therapeutic success may be linked to the effect of anti-tubercular drugs against SARS ncov-2, especially rifampin, inhibiting the formation of messenger RNAs of SARS ncov-2 or to the synergistic effect of chloroquine and rifampin. Researchers should explore the effect of these drugs on SARS ncov-2. Copyright ©Fah Bouare et al.	false
0	Nafamostat mesylate-induced hyperkalemia in critically ill patients with COVID-19: Four case reports. BACKGROUND: Nafamostat mesylate (NM) may prove to be one of the key drugs effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of its anti-viral properties and the potential to manage coagulopathy. However, NM tends to increase serum potassium levels., CASE SUMMARY: We observed hyperkalemia immediately after NM administration (200 mg/d) in four consecutive patients who were admitted to the Kanazawa University Hospital with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Urinary potassium excretion decreased after NM administration in three patients who underwent urinalysis., CONCLUSION: NM is likely to produce hyperkalemia in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor serum potassium values closely after NM initiation in COVID-19 patients who need respiratory support. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020.

0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) set to increase burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Kenya. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in Kenya on March 13, 2020, is spreading rapidly. As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya. All due care should be taken, to prevent and effectively manage the disease, to avert an imminent epidemic of atherosclerotic disease. Copyright ©Julius Ogeng'o et al.	false
0	Clinical, Laboratory, and Interferon-Alpha Response Characteristics of Patients With Chilblain-like Lesions During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Importance: Chilblain-like lesions have been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pathophysiology of such manifestations remains largely unknown., Objective: To perform a systematic clinical, histologic, and biologic assessment in a cohort of patients with chilblain-like lesions occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective case series carried out with a COVID-19 multidisciplinary consultation group at the University Hospital of Nice, France, 40 consecutive patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions were included., Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients underwent a thorough general and dermatologic examination, including skin biopsies, vascular investigations, biologic analyses, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) stimulation and detection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analysis., Results: Overall, 40 consecutive patients with chilblain-like lesions were included. Most patients were young, with a median (range) age of 22 (12-67) years; 19 were male and 21 were female. The clinical presentation was highly reproducible with chilblain-like lesions mostly on the toes. Bullous and necrotic evolution was observed in 11 patients. Acrocyanosis or cold toes were reported in 19 (47.5%) cases. Criteria compatible with COVID-19 cases were noted in 11 (27.5%) within 6 weeks prior to the eruption. The real-time PCR (rt-PCR) testing results were negative in all cases. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 serology results were positive in 12 patients (30%). D-dimer concentration levels were elevated in 24 (60.0%) cases. Cryoglobulinemia and parvovirus B19 serologic results were negative for all tested patients. The major histologic findings were features of lymphocytic inflammation and vascular damage with thickening of venule walls and pericyte hyperplasia. A significant increase of IFN-alpha production after in vitro stimulation was observed in the chilblain population compared with patients with mild-severe acute COVID-19., Conclusions and Relevance: Taken together, our results suggest that chilblain-like lesions observed during the COVID-19 pandemic represent manifestations of a viral-induced type I interferonopathy., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04344119.	false
0	Post COVID Inflammation Syndrome: Different Manifestations Caused by the Virus. Background: Incidence of viral pneumonia has been reported in several patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The infection has also been linked to the development of inflammatory syndromes and related clinical manifestations., Result: The present study discusses four cases of COVID infection showing varying clinical features. The post-COVID inflammation syndrome was associated with non-specific inflammation and post viral arthritis in three cases. One other subject had vasculitis leading to central retinal artery occlusion., Conclusion: As the number of cases of COVID-19 cases has been increasing globally, it is advisable that physicians consider the possibility of post-COVID manifestations while examining patients with non-specific inflammation. A short course of NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine regimen has been found to be beneficial for alleviating symptoms, and in rare cases with organ threatening inflammation, steroids may be required.

In this case report we present a rare case of a patient with multiple risk factors for severe coronavirus disease (COVID 19) in whom intensive glucocorticoid treatment due to incipient nephrotic syndrome coincided with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high baseline risk profile and the use of glucocorticoids the patient developed only mild disease including IgG SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.	false
0	A role for naturally occurring variation of the murine coronavirus spike protein in stabilizing association with the cellular receptor. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, initiates infection by binding to its cellular receptor (MHVR) via spike (S) proteins projecting from the virion membrane. The structures of these S proteins vary considerably among MHV strains, and this variation is generally considered to be important in determining the strain-specific pathologies of MHV infection, perhaps by affecting the interaction between MHV and the MHVR. To address the relationships between S variation and receptor binding, assays capable of measuring interactions between MHV and MHVR were developed. The assays made use of a novel soluble form of the MHVR, sMHVR-Ig, which comprised the virus- binding immunoglobulin-like domain of MHVR fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin GL sMHVR-Ig was stably expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in human 293 EBNA cells and was immobilized to Sepharose-protein G via the Fc domain. The resulting Sepharose beads were used to adsorb radiolabelled MHV particles. At 4degreeC, the beads specifically adsorbed two prototype MHV strains, MHV JHM (strain 4) and a tissue culture-adapted mutant of MHV JHM, the JHMX strain. A shift to 37degreeC resulted in elution of JHM but not JHMX. This in vitro observation of JHM (but not JHMX) elution from its receptor at 37degreeC was paralleled by a corresponding 37degreeC elution of receptor-associated JHM (but not JHMX) from tissue culture cells. The basis for this difference in maintenance of receptor association was correlated with a large deletion mutation present within the JHMX S protein, as sMHVR-Ig exhibited relatively thermostable binding to vaccinia virus-expressed S proteins containing the deletion. These results indicate that naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus S protein affect the stability of the initial interaction with the host cell and thus contribute to the likelihood of successful infection by incoming virions. These changes in virus entry features may result in coronaviruses with novel pathogenic properties.	false
0	Protein corona meets freeze-drying: overcoming the challenges of colloidal stability, toxicity, and opsonin adsorption. Freeze-drying of nanoparticle suspensions is capable of generating stable nanoformulations with improved storage times and easier transportation. Nonetheless, nanoparticle aggregation is likely induced during freeze-drying, which reduces its redispersibility upon reconstitution and leads to undesirable effects such as non-specific toxicity and impaired efficacy. In this work, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is described as a suitable protectant for silica nanoparticles (SNPs), which result in solid structures with excellent redispersibility and negligible signs of aggregation even when longer storage times are considered. We experimentally demonstrated that massive system aggregation can be prevented when a saturated BSA corona around the nanoparticle is formed before the lyophilization process. Furthermore, the BSA corona is able to suppress non-specific interactions between these nanoparticles and biological systems, as evidenced by the lack of residual cytotoxicity, hemolytic activity and opsonin adsorption. Hence, BSA can be seriously considered for industry as an additive for nanoparticle freeze-drying since it generates solid and redispersible nanoformulations with improved biocompatibility.	false
0	Population mobility and adult orthopaedic trauma services during the COVID-19 pandemic: fragility fracture provision remains a priority. Aims: This study aims to define the epidemiology of trauma presenting to a single centre providing all orthopaedic trauma care for a population of ~ 900,000 over the first 40 days of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that presenting over the same period one year earlier. The secondary aim was to compare this with population mobility data obtained from Google., Methods: A cross-sectional study of consecutive adult (> 13 years) patients with musculoskeletal trauma referred as either in-patients or out-patients over a 40-day period beginning on 5 March 2020, the date of the first reported UK COVID-19 death, was performed. This time period encompassed social distancing measures. This group was compared to a group of patients referred over the same calendar period in 2019 and to publicly available mobility data from Google., Results: Orthopaedic trauma referrals reduced by 42% (1,056 compared to 1,820) during the study period, and by 58% (405 compared to 967) following national lockdown. Outpatient referrals reduced by 44%, and inpatient referrals by 36%, and the number of surgeries performed by 36%. The regional incidence of traumatic injury fell from 5.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.79 to 5.35) to 2.94 (95% CI 2.52 to 3.32) per 100,000 population per day. Significant reductions were seen in injuries related to sports and alcohol consumption. No admissions occurred relating to major trauma (Injury Severity Score > 16) or violence against the person. Changes in population mobility and trauma volume from baseline correlated significantly (Pearson's correlation 0.749, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85, p < 0.001). However, admissions related to fragility fractures remained unchanged compared to the 2019 baseline., Conclusion: The profound changes in social behaviour and mobility during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have directly correlated with a significant decrease in orthopaedic trauma referrals, but fragility fractures remained unaffected and provision for these patients should be maintained.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:182-189.

0	COVID era: Perception of oncologists from a developing nation. Background: Cancer being a lethal disease, delay in treatment may be fatal. International organizations have come up with useful guidelines for cancer management. Still the availability of resources, infrastructure, state health policy, COVID incidence and approach of healthcare professionals differ. This study aims to find out the perception and approaches of Indian oncologists - which might prove to be useful in nation specific delivery of cancer care during COVID Pandemic. Method(s): After taking consent, a survey form was circulated online amongst oncologists (haemato/ radiation/ medical/ surgical) across the country and responses collected. Result(s): 79.2% oncologists represent private sector, 16.8% government sector. 50% oncologists were willing to postpone investigations for stable cancer patients. 42.6% willing to start treatment without knowing the COVID status, while 44.6% were against the idea and 12.9% were indecisive. 73% willing to perform surgery right away for operable nonemergency cases with a negative COVID status and rest 27 % willing to postpone surgery. Concurrent Chemoradiation (57%) was preferred over sequential approach (43%). Majority (53.5%) were comfortable prescribing chemotherapy via telemedicine. Asymptomatic COVID positive patients requiring chemotherapy 64.4% were willing to wait for the virus to resolve and then start therapy and 35.6% were suggesting some form of oral therapy and ongoing isolation. 89.1% preferred oral route if option present. 83.7 % preferred targeted therapy, 8.2% immunotherapy and rest went for other options. 93.1 % preferred day care chemotherapy during COVID and not admission. 61 % thought extended course of dexamethasone given as premedication during chemotherapy did not have a protective role for patients during COVID outbreak. Treatment initiation criteria in descending order - 39.6% stage of the disease, 36.6 % performance status, 22.8% COVID status and for rest it was the cost. 91% oncologists thought nurses were at a higher risk of exposure to COVID infection than the doctors. 54.5% were not taking anti COVID prophylaxis. Conclusion(s): Greater homogeneity in practice was noticed amongst oncologists of a developing nation during COVID outbreak. The above information might be useful in policy making.

0	Neurosurgery in times of a pandemic: a survey of neurosurgical services during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Veneto region in Italy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and of the subsequent lockdown on the neurosurgical services of the Veneto region in Italy compared to the previous 4 years., METHODS: A survey was conducted in all 6 neurosurgical departments in the Veneto region to collect data about surgical, inpatient care and endovascular procedures during the month of March for each year from 2016 to 2020. Safety measures to avoid infection from SARS-CoV-2 and any COVID-19 cases reported among neurosurgical patients or staff members were considered., RESULTS: The mean number of neurosurgical admissions for the month of March over the 2016-2019 period was 663, whereas in March 2020 admissions decreased by 42%. Emergency admissions decreased by 23%. The average number of neurosurgical procedures was 697, and declined by 30% (range -10% to -51% in individual centers). Emergency procedures decreased in the same period by 23%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage both decreased in Veneto-by 25% and 22%, respectively. Coiling for unruptured aneurysm, coiling for ruptured aneurysm, and surgery for ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation diminished by 49%, 27%, and 78%, respectively. Endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) increased by 33% in 2020 (28 procedures in total). There was a slight decrease (8%) in brain tumor surgeries. Neurosurgical admissions decreased by 25% and 35% for head trauma and spinal trauma, respectively, while surgical procedures for head trauma diminished by 19% and procedures for spinal trauma declined by 26%. Admissions and surgical treatments for degenerative spine were halved. Eleven healthcare workers and 8 patients were infected in the acute phase of the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study describes the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak on neurosurgical activities in a vast region in Italy. Remodulation of neurosurgical activities has resulted in a significant reduction of elective and emergency surgeries compared to previous years. Most likely this is a combined result of cancellation of elective and postponable surgeries, increase of conservative management, increase in social restrictions, and in patients' fear of accessing hospitals. Curiously, only endovascular procedures for AIS have increased, possibly due to reduced physical activity or increased thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2. The confounding effect of thrombectomy increase over time cannot be excluded. No conclusion can be drawn on AIS incidence. Active monitoring with nasopharyngeal swabs, wearing face masks, and using separate pathways for infected patients reduce the risk of infection.	false
0	Establishment and utilization of an evaluation system for virucidal activity of disinfectants against a coronavirus with apparent applicability to SARS-CoV-2. Decontamination of pathogens on surfaces of substances is very important for controlling infectious diseases. In the present experiments, we tested various disinfectants in aqueous phase as well as on plastic surface carrying a viral inoculum, through dropping and wiping decontamination techniques, comparatively, so as to evaluate virucidal efficacies of those disinfectants toward an avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus: IBV). We regard this evaluation system applicable to SARS-CoV-2. The disinfectants evaluated were 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH)2) solution, sodium hypochlorite at 500 or 1,000 ppm of total chlorine (NaClO-500 or NaClO-1000, respectively), NaClO at 500 ppm of total chlorine in 0.17% FdCa(OH)2 (Mix-500) and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 500-fold in water (QAC-500). In the suspension test, all solutions inactivated IBV inoculum that contained 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under detectable level within 30 sec. In the carrier test, all solutions, except NaClO-500, could inactivate IBV with 0.5% FBS on a carrier to undetectable level in the wiping-sheets and wiped-carriers. We thus conclude that suspension and carrier tests should be introduced to evaluate disinfectants for the field usage, and that this evaluation system is important and workable for resultful selection of the tested disinfectants against avian coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, particularly on plastic fomite.	false
0	Serum protein profiling reveals a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Severe courses of COVID-19 are associated with elevated levels of interleukin 6. However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19., METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles., RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.

0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Severe COVID-19 Induced Acute Kidney Injury. BACKGROUND: The incidence and outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced kidney injury have been variably described. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, correlates and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI)., METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 671 critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China between January 1 to February 29, 2020. Data were captured on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, acute physiology, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary exposure was ICU admission for confirmed COVID-19 related critically illness. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with AKI, organ dysfunction, treatment intensity, and health services use., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 671 severe COVID-19 patients (median [IQR] 65 [56-73] years; male sex 65% (n = 434); hypertension 43% (n = 287) and APACHE II score 10 [7-14]), 39% developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, had greater markers of inflammation and coagulation activation, and had greater acuity and organ dysfunction as presentation. Despite similar treatment with antivirals, patients with AKI had lower viral conversion negative rates than those without AKI. The 28-day mortality was much higher in AKI patients than patients without AKI (72% vs. 42%), and there was an increase in 28-day mortality according to the severity of AKI. Non-survivors were less likely to receive antiviral therapy [132 (70%) vs. 65 (88%)] compared with survivors and have lower viral negative conversion rate [17 (9%) vs. 47 (64%)]., CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury was quite common in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, which associated with higher mortality.	false
0	Deregulated cellular circuits driving immunoglobulins and complement consumption associate with the severity of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for the outcome of COVID-19. We investigated whether the specific immune responses in the peripheral blood of 276 patients associated to severity and progression of COVID-19. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. Conversely, the proportion of B cells, plasmablasts, circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) and CD56-CD16+ NK-cells increased. Regarding humoral immunity, levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected, but when degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients. Compared to healthy donors, complement C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, while the activation peptide of C5 (C5a) increased from the admission in every patient, regardless their severity. Moreover, total IgG, the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, associating severity with an imbalanced humoral response and identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.

0	A Propensity-Matched Cohort Study of Tocilizumab in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. To determine the impact of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Observational cohort study of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. A propensity-matched (1:1) analysis was used to compare patients who received tocilizumab to controls who did not. Competing risk survival analysis was used to determine the primary outcome of time to mortality, and adjusted log-linear and logistic regression for secondary outcomes., Setting: Three hospitals within the NYU Langone Health system in New York., Patients: Consecutive adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019., Intervention: Tocilizumab 400-mg IV once in addition to standard of care or standard of care alone., Measurements and Main Results: Data from 3,580 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive qualifying hospitalized patients were included, of whom 497 (13.9%) were treated with tocilizumab. In the analysis of tocilizumab-treated patients and matched controls, fewer tocilizumab-treated patients died (145/497, 29.2%) than did controls (211/497, 42.4%). In the adjusted competing risk regression model, tocilizumab therapy was associated with improved survival relative to controls (hazard ratio = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.18-0.33, p < 0.001). Tocilizumab-treated patients and controls had similar adjusted time to discharge from hospital (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.78-1.17, p = 0.67). However, they had longer adjusted ICU length of stay (rate ratio = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.5-3.7, p < 0.001) and a higher adjusted infection rate (odds ratio = 4.18, 95% CI = 2.72-6.52, p < 0.001) than controls., Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy was associated with significantly improved survival in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This survival benefit was associated with increased ICU length of stay and increased infection rate, even as more patients in the tocilizumab group were rescued from rapid death. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Identification of HLA-A*02:01-restricted candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2 that may be natural targets of CD8+ T cell recognition in vivo. COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed and human trials are underway. Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines. IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Out of 82 peptides predicted on bioinformatics, 54 peptides showed good binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. Using HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice, 18 in 54 peptides were found to be CTL epitopes in the intracellular cytokine staining assay. Out of 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant. Surprisingly, all immunized mice did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three reaction patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.

0	Where did the patients go? Changes in acute appendicitis presentation and severity of illness during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic restricted movement of individuals and altered provision of health care, abruptly transforming health care-use behaviors. It serves as a natural experiment to explore changes in presentations for surgical diseases including acute appendicitis. The objective was to determine if the pandemic was associated with changes in incidence of acute appendicitis compared to a historical control and to determine if there were associated changes in disease severity., METHODS: The study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (N = 956) presenting with appendicitis in nonpandemic versus pandemic time periods (December 1, 2019-March 10, 2020 versus March 11, 2020-May 16, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 composed the historical control. Primary outcome was mean biweekly counts of all appendicitis presentations, then stratified by complicated (n = 209) and uncomplicated (n = 747) disease. Trends in presentations were compared using difference-in-differences methodology. Changes in odds of presenting with complicated disease were assessed via clustered multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: There was a 29% decrease in mean biweekly appendicitis presentations from 5.4 to 3.8 (rate ratio = 0.71 [0.51, 0.98]) after the pandemic declaration, with a significant difference in differences compared with historical control (P = .003). Stratified by severity, the decrease was significant for uncomplicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.47-0.91]) when compared with historical control (P = .03) but not for complicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.52]); (P = .49). The odds of presenting with complicated disease did not change (adjusted odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 0.83-2.25])., CONCLUSION: The pandemic was associated with decreased incidence of uncomplicated appendicitis without an accompanying increase in complicated disease. Changes in individual health care-use behaviors may underlie these differences, suggesting that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve without progression to complicated disease.

0	Infant feeding initiation practices in the context of COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVE: Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown., STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 'hotspot' in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)., RESULTS: The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (-15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03 +/- 4.88 vs. 8.03 +/- 4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 +/- 0.65 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62 +/- 0.60 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the 'hotspot' COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.

0	The EAN COVID-19 registry (ENERGY): An international instrument for surveillance of neurological complications in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health issue. Neurological complications have been reported in up to one-third of affected cases, but their distribution varies significantly in terms of prevalence, incidence and phenotypical characteristics. Variability can be mostly explained by the differing sources of cases (hospital vs. community-based), the accuracy of the diagnostic approach, and the interpretation of the patients' complaints. Moreover, after recovering, patients can still experience neurological symptoms. To obtain a more precise picture of the neurological manifestations and outcome of the COVID-19 infection, an international registry (ENERGY) has been created by the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) in collaboration with European national neurological societies and the Neurocritical Care Society and Research Network (NCRN). ENERGY can be implemented as a stand-alone instrument for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients AND neurological findings or as an addendum to an existing registry not targeting neurologic symptoms. Data are also collected to study the impact of neurological symptoms and neurological complications on outcomes. The variables included in the registry have been selected in the interest of most countries, to favour pooling with data from other sources, and to facilitate data collection even in resource-poor countries. Included are adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, ascertained through neurological consultation, and providing informed consent. Key demographic and clinical findings are collected at registration. Patients are followed up to 12 months in search of incident neurological manifestations. As of August 19, 254 centres from 69 countries and four continents have made requests to join the study. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	A rare case of co-occurrence of pulmonary embolism and left ventricular thrombus in a patient with COVID-19. The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality, not only causing devastating lung injury but also has an enormous effect on the cardiovascular system. The hypercoagulable state associated with coronavirus 2019 plays a major role in the disease manifestation. Venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism remains the most common thrombotic manifestation of the disease as compared to arterial thrombosis. Nonetheless, the co-occurrence of both venous and arterial thrombosis in a coronavirus 2019 patient, to our knowledge, has rarely been reported. Herein, we are presenting a case of co-occurrence of left ventricular thrombosis with pulmonary embolism in the setting of coronavirus 2019 with successful treatment with apixaban.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Prevalence and clinical outcomes of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emerging data have linked the presence of cardiac injury with a worse prognosis in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, available data cannot clearly characterize the correlation between cardiac injury and COVID-19. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies to 1) explore the prevalence of cardiac injury in different types of COVID-19 patients and 2) evaluate the association between cardiac injury and worse prognosis (severe disease, admission to ICU, and mortality) in patients with COVID-19., METHODS AND RESULTS: Literature search was conducted through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and MedRxiv databases. A meta-analysis was performed with Stata 14.0. A fixed-effects model was used if the I2 values <= 50%, otherwise the random-effects model was performed. The prevalence of cardiac injury was 19% (95% CI: 0.15-0.22, and p < 0.001) in total COVID-19 patients, 36% (95% CI: 0.25-0.47, and p < 0.001) in severe COVID-19 patients, and 48% (95% CI: 0.30-0.66, and p < 0.001) in non-survivors. Furthermore, cardiac injury was found to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of poor outcomes with a pooled effect size (ES) of 8.46 (95% CI: 3.76-19.06, and p = 0.062), severe disease with an ES of 3.54 (95% CI: 2.25-5.58, and p < 0.001), admission to ICU with an ES of 5.03 (95% CI: 2.69-9.39, and p < 0.001), and mortality with an ES of 4.99 (95% CI: 3.38-7.37, and p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cardiac injury was greatly increased in COVID-19 patients, particularly in patients with severe disease and non-survivors. COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be associated with poor outcomes, severity of disease, admission to ICU, and mortality.

0	Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by dimeric IgA. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals following diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Further, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be two-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were on average fifteen times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target. Thus, dimeric IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy. Copyright © 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science.	false
0	Investigation of beta-lactoglobulin derived bioactive peptides against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): in silico analysis. The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which started in late 2019 in Wuhan, China spread to the whole world in a short period of time, and thousands of people have died due to this epidemic. Although scientists have been searching for methods to manage SARS-CoV-2, there is no specific medication against COVID-19 as of yet. Two main approaches should be followed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2; one of which is to neutralize the virus, and the other is to inhibit the host cell membrane receptors, where SARS-CoV-2 will bind. In this study, peptides derived from beta-lactoglobulin, which inactivates both the virus and its receptors in the host cell, were identified using computer-based in silico analysis. The beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides used in this study were obtained by the treatment of goat milk whey fraction with trypsin. The structure of the peptides was characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS), and six beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides were selected as candidate peptides. Subsequently, the effects of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and host cells were identified using virtual screening. According to the results of this in silico analysis, Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALMPHIR) and Ile-Pro-Ala-Val-Phe-Lys (IPAVFK) peptides were evaluated as potential candidates to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 after the future in vitro and in vivo studies.

0	The Associated Factors of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Wuhan, China. This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, China. A total of 99 COVID-19 patients were recruited and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale. Results showed there was no significant difference in anxiety or depressive symptoms between male and female. Patients aged 46-60 years old had a higher ratio of both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Besides, patients whose hospital stays was longer than 14 days had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than those stays was less than 7 days. There was no significant difference in the correlation between level of dyspnea and the levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients might have anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization. Clinicians should pay attention to the middle age group and patients with longer hospital stays.	false
0	Phenotyping mental health: Age, community size, and depression differently modulate COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. INTRODUCTION: When the first COVID-19 infections were reported in Germany, fear and anxiety spread faster than the pandemic itself. While moderate amounts of fear of a COVID-19 infection may be functional, generalized anxiety and the potentially resulting distress and psychopathology may possibly be detrimental to people's health. Authorities need to avoid a countrywide panic, on the one hand, but foster a realistic awareness of the actual threat, on the other hand., OBJECTIVES: The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate psychological reactions in response to the real or perceived infection threats. In particular, the analysis should reveal whether COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety in times of COVID-19 have distinct correlates., METHODS: A nationwide study was conducted from March 10th to May 4th 2020 in Germany (n = 15,308; 10,824 women, 4433 men, 51 other). Generalized anxiety was assessed using the GAD-7, while COVID-19-related fear was measured using a self-generated item. Both outcome variables were entered into linear regression models. Demographic information, depressive symptoms, trust in governmental interventions, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 and media use were used to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related fear., RESULTS: The data revealed distinct correlates of COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. Although COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety had overlapping predictors, such as neuroticism, they most prominently differed in age distribution and direction of an urban-rural disparity: generalized anxiety decreases with age, but COVID-19-related fear is most pronounced in elderly participants. Generalized anxiety is also more prevalent in rural communities, but COVID-19-related fear is elevated in metropoles. Furthermore, the presence of a risk disease increases COVID-19-related fear, but not generalized anxiety., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COVID-19-related fear is often justified considering the individual risk of infection or complication due to infection. Some of the characteristics that predict COVID-19-related fear leave generalized anxiety unaffected or show divergent predictive directions. The present findings hint toward two related, but discriminant constructs. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false

0	"Early Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies as a Serologic Marker of Infection in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: Thousands of medical staff have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with hundreds of deaths reported. Such loss could be prevented if there were a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHOD(S): Using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreak or during the outbreak and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULT(S): The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and 1 of 5 nucleic acid test-negative ""close contacts"" of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION(S): With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, incoming patients, passengers, and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders,"" protect the medical staff, and stop further spread of the virus.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Source and symptoms of COVID-19 among hospital workers in Milan. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are commonly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and represent one of the most vulnerable groups. Adequate prevention strategies are necessary to guarantee HCWs' safety, as well as to prevent dissemination of the infection among patients., AIMS: To describe a case series of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in a large public healthcare organization in Milan (Italy) during the most devastating weeks of the epidemic and analyse the sources, symptoms and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate., RESULTS: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free., CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are commonly infected due to close contacts with other positive HCWs, and non-COVID departments were most affected. Most HCWs were asymptomatic or subclinical but contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic HCWs help identify and isolate infected workers. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	In-silico study of the inhibitory effect of some flavonoids compounds and their derivatives on SARSCOV-2. The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 forms a big threat to all people in the world around us. In Iraq, there is a direct increase in the incidence, with a slight decrease in the mortality rate, and that leads us to attempt to find any way to stop or lessen the virus's harmful symptoms. In the current study, we used molecular docking to detect the probable inhibitory effect of fifteen natural compounds of some Flavonoids and their derivatives and two antiviral drugs against two of very important SARS-COV-2 proteins the papain like protease (PLpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that was performed using Molecular Operating Environment software(MOE). All the chosen flavonoids and their derivatives, plus the two antiviral drugs docked in the active sites of the viral proteins (PLpro), some of the natural flavonoids like Glycitein 7-O-glucuronide and Theaflavin, gives energy complex scores about-6.96308947 and-6.99058199 Kcal/mol which is better than the energy score is given by Sofosbuvir and Darunavir-6.81020832 and-6.93942785 Kcal/mol respectively. And the docking of the compounds into the active sites of (RdRp) protein gives energy binding scores for Theaflavin monogallate-7.84163618 kcal/mol and that better than the complex's score given by docking of the Sofosbuvir and Darunavir into the same protein which gives-7.30999422 and-7.67598867 kcal/mol respectively. That's mean these flavonoids and their derivatives can be used as COVID-19 treatment. Otherwise, the infected people with COVID-19 can consume food rich with these Flavonoids to inhibit the virus or at least decrease its symptoms. Also from docking of flavonoids into both viral proteins, we can notice that all-natural compounds reported energy binding scores, and the Flavonoid derivatives have a better energy binding score than flavonoid themselves.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Could KL-6 levels in COVID-19 help to predict lung disease?. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of international concern. Together with the quest for an effective treatment, the question of the post-infectious evolution of affected patients in healing process remains uncertain. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a high molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein produced by type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. Its production is raised during epithelial lesions and cellular regeneration. In COVID-19 infection, KL-6 serum levels could therefore be of interest for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response evaluation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study retrospectively compared KL-6 levels between a cohort of 83 COVID-19 infected patients and two other groups: healthy subjects (n = 70) on one hand, and a heterogenous group of patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (n = 31; composed of 16 IPF, 4 sarcoidosis, 11 others) on the other hand. Demographical, clinical and laboratory indexes were collected. Our study aims to compare KL-6 levels between a COVID-19 population and healthy subjects or patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Ultimately, we ought to determine whether KL-6 could be a marker of disease severity and bad prognosis., RESULTS: Our results showed that serum KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were increased compared to healthy subjects, but to a lesser extent than in patients suffering from ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe lung disease., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KL-6 could be a good biomarker to assess ILD severity in COVID-19 infection. Concerning the therapeutic response prediction, more studies are necessary.	false
0	Burnout Incidence during Online Lectures in Medical Students in Udayana University during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Introduction: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that caused by SARS-CoV-2 with new cases and mortality rates that are increasing recently. Due to inadequate of health facilities in Indonesia and the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, some actions are required to reduce the spread of the virus, such as physical distancing. In educational aspect, conventional learning systems are replaced by online learning system. This kind of system may cause burnout in medical students. The aim of the study was to describe the burnout incidence during online lectures in medical students in Udayana University during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross sectional study with 175 medical students in Udayana University class of 2018 and 2019 was conducted in this study. The data were collected via goggle form which includes informed consent and questionnaire which contains burnout scale. Univariate and bivariate analysis through chi-square test was conducted in this study. Result(s): According to univariate analysis, there was 75.4% students were experienced moderate burnout, 4.9% students were experienced high burnout, and 9.7% were experienced low burnout. Based on chi-square results (p<0.05). There was no significant relationship between burnout incidence and age (p=0.813), sex (p=0.813), and students' generations (p=0.761). Conclusion(s): Most of the students had experienced moderate burnout. Therefore, a new learning method that does not increase students' burden during online lectures is recommended in this study and further research is required to find the potential factors that affect burnout syndrome.Copyright ©2009-2020, JGPT.

0	Chinese Residents' Perceptions of COVID-19 During the Pandemic: Online Cross-sectional Survey Study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has posed a global threat due to substantial morbidity and mortality, and health education strategies need to be adjusted accordingly to prevent a possible epidemic rebound. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 among individuals coming to, returning to, or living in Jiangsu Province, China, and determine the impact of the pandemic on the perceptions of the public. METHOD(S): In this study, an online questionnaire was distributed to participants between February 15 and April 21, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on personal information (eg, sex, age, educational level, and occupation); protection knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to COVID-19; access to COVID-19-related information; and current information needs. Factors influencing the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score for COVID-19 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) and its 95% credible interval were calculated and compared with the daily participation number and protection scores. RESULT(S): In total, 52,066 participants were included in the study; their average knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were 25.58 (SD 4.22), 24.05 (SD 4.02), 31.51 (SD 2.84), and 90.02 (SD 8.87), respectively, and 65.91% (34,315/52,066) had a total protection score above 90 points. For the knowledge and skill sections, correct rates of answers to questions on medical observation days, infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, cough or sneeze treatment, and precautions were higher than 95%, while those of questions on initial symptoms (32,286/52,066, 62.01%), transmission routes (37,134/52,066, 71.32%), selection of disinfection products (37,390/52,066, 71.81%), and measures of home quarantine (40,037/52,066, 76.90%) were relatively low. For the actual behavior section, 97.93% (50,989/52,066) of participants could wear masks properly when going out. However, 19.76% (10,290/52,066) could not disinfect their homes each week, and 18.42% (9589/52,066) could not distinguish differences in initial symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19. The regression analyses showed that the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were influenced by sex, age, educational level, occupation, and place of residence at different degrees (P<.001). The government, television shows, and news outlets were the main sources of protection knowledge, and the information released by the government and authoritative medical experts was considered the most reliable. The current information needs included the latest epidemic developments, disease treatment progress, and daily protection knowledge. The Rt in the Jiangsu Province and mainland China dropped below 1, while the global Rt remained at around 1. The maximal information coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that the public's perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic. CONCLUSION(S): A high proportion of the participants had sufficient COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. Thus, it is necessary to apply different health education measures tailored to work and study resumption for specific populations to improve their self-protection and, ultimately, to prevent a possible rebound of COVID-19.Copyright ©Tingting Cui, Guoping Yang, Lili Ji, Lin Zhu, Shiqi Zhen, Naiyang Shi, Yan Xu, Hui Jin.

0	The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult and Pediatric Allergy & Immunology Services in the UK National Health Service. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed multiple restrictions on healthcare services., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the pandemic on Allergy & Immunology (A&I) services in the UK., METHODS: National survey of all A&I services registered with the Royal College of Physicians and/or British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The survey covered staffing, facilities, personal protective equipment, appointments & patient review, investigations, treatments and research activity. Weeks commencing 03 Feb'20 (pre-COVID), 06 April'20 and 08'May'20 were used as reference points for the dataset., RESULTS: 99 services participated. There was a reduction in nursing, medical, administrative and allied health professional staff during pandemic; 86% and 92% of A&I services continued to accept non-urgent and urgent referrals respectively during the pandemic. There were changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) dose and infusion regimen in 67% and 14% of adult and pediatric services respectively; 30% discontinued immunoglobulin replacement in some patients. There was a significant (all variables, p<=0.0001) reduction in the following: face-to-face consultations (increase in telephone consultations), initiation of venom immunotherapy, sublingual and subcutaneous injection immunotherapy, anesthetic allergy testing and hospital procedures (food challenges, immunoglobulin and omalizumab, administration); and a significant increase (p<=0.0001) in home therapy for immunoglobulin and omalizumab. Adverse clinical outcomes were reported, but none were serious., CONCLUSION: The pandemic had significant impact on A&I services leading to multiple unplanned pragmatic amendments in service delivery. There is an urgent need for prospective audits and strategic planning in the medium and long term to achieve equitable, safe and standardised healthcare. Copyright © 2020.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), a single-stranded RNA virus, was found to be the causal agent of the disease called coronavirus disease. During December 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology, which caused severe-acute respiratory distress. The disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Due to alarming levels of spread and severity, on the 11th of March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak as a global pandemic. As of September 14 2020, more than 29 million cases have been reported, with over 900,000 deaths globally. Since the outbreak, although not conclusive, discoveries have been made regarding the understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, clinical treatment, and prevention of the disease. SARS-COV-2 has been detected in saliva, respiratory fluids, blood, urine, and faeces. Findings are however controversial regarding its presence in the semen or the testis. Hence, this review aimed to further analyse the literature concerning (i) the effects of previously identified human coronaviruses on male fertility (ii) the impact of Covid-19 on male fertility and (iii) the implication for general health in terms of infection and transmission.

0	Are nursing home residents on enteral feeding in north dublin receiving adequate vitamin d during the covid-19 pandemic?. Rationale: Vitamin D may be protective during the Covid-19 pandemic1 but levels in the Irish population are typically low2. Daily supplementation of 20mug Vitamin D is recommended3. Our aim was to assess if vitamin D content in enteral feeding regimens of nursing home residents were adequate. Method(s): Vitamin D intake were assessed by calculating the content of enteral feeding regimens and additional vitamin D supplements prescribed. It was not feasible to measure serum vitamin D levels. Result(s): Forty-two tube fed residents were reviewed. Average age 58 years (range 25-94 years), 52% male, average duration on enteral feeding 46 months (range 1-102 months). Less than half (43%) ate oral diet. Enteral feeding provided average 18.7mug daily (range 6.2-50mug), 3 residents received <10 mug/d and 14 receiving >20 mug/d. There was no significant difference in intakes between those on oral diet or nil per oral (18.6mug versus 18.9mug). Eleven residents (26%), were taking additional vitamin D supplements. Conclusion(s): The majority of nursing home residents on longterm tube feeding reviewed were receiving adequate intakes of vitamin D. Enteral feeding provides a reliable source of vitamin D in comparison to usual dietary intakes of nursing home residents. The vitamin D content of the enteral feeding regimen should be discussed with the dietitian before additional supplements are prescribed to avoid excessive intakes. Specific recommendations on vitamin D requirements for adults on tube feeding, particularly in residential settings are required. References: 1. McKenna MJ and Flynn MAT.

0	An evaluation of MRI lumbar spine scans within a community-based diagnostic setting. BACKGROUND: With an ongoing move towards more management of patients within the community setting, demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing and commonly used in lower back conditions. There is well recorded overuse of MRI in this scenario which goes against evidence-based practice and adds to rising healthcare costs., METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of lumbar spine MRI scans performed within a community-based setting over an 18-month period. The review took a randomised purposive sample of patients (n = 450); looking at adherence to, and relevance of, guidelines in managing lower back conditions. Data extracted provided information on demographics and prevalence of clinical presentation and report observations., RESULTS: There is variation in practice and utlisation of MRI with this patient group which warrants further exploration. Results support inappropriate use, lacking adherence to guidelines and pathways, leading to unnecessary imaging. 46% of referrals were considered clinically justified with 38% of report findings considered abnormal and of clinical relevance. Chi-square and binomial logistic regression were used to assess the significance and relationship of any factors on referral justification and report outcome. No difference was found between type of referrer, with patient age and leg symptoms being significant factors., CONCLUSION: The study highlights the opportunity to integrate better referral criteria to improve referral quality, its suitability and the relevance of final reports. In the current climate this would help manage appropriate use of imaging resources during the post COVID-19 pandemic recovery phase, as well as support recommendations regarding diagnostic reform and a move towards more community-based diagnostics.

0	Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases: A cochrane review. BACKGROUND Many dental procedures produce aerosols that harbour various pathogenic micro-organisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS The following databases were searched on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Insti tutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. SELECTION CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aero sol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding pre-procedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years (8 studies at high risk of bias). No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). The results described below should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the minimal clinically important difference in CFU. Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot from a patient's mouth, but not at longer distances (3 splitmouth RCTs, 122 participants). One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector during AGPs or after AGPs. One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one metre and two-metre distance. One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead and occipital region of the operator. One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest and dental unit light. One split-mouth CCT (2 participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation or ultrasonic scaling. Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth. Two RCTs evaluated use of anti microbial coolants during ultra sonic scaling. Compared with dis tilled water, coolant-containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using CFU. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions, but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions.Copyright © 2020 EDRA SpA.

0	Biosensor and Lab-on-a-chip Biomarker-identifying Technologies for Oral and Periodontal Diseases. Periodontitis is a complex multifactorial disease that can lead to destruction of tooth supporting tissues and subsequent tooth loss. The most recent global burden of disease studies highlight that severe periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory conditions affecting humans. Periodontitis risk is attributed to genetics, host-microbiome and environmental factors. Empirical diagnostic and prognostic systems have yet to be validated in the field of periodontics. Early diagnosis and intervention prevents periodontitis progression in most patients. Increased susceptibility and suboptimal control of modifiable risk factors can result in poor response to therapy, and relapse. The chronic immune-inflammatory response to microbial biofilms at the tooth or dental implant surface is associated with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or gastrointestinal diseases. Oral fluid-based biomarkers have demonstrated easy accessibility and potential as diagnostics for oral and systemic diseases, including the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. Advances in biotechnology have led to innovations in lab-on-a-chip and biosensors to interface with oral-based biomarker assessment. This review highlights new developments in oral biomarker discovery and their validation for clinical application to advance precision oral medicine through improved diagnosis, prognosis and patient stratification. Their potential to improve clinical outcomes of periodontitis and associated chronic conditions will benefit the dental and overall public health.© Copyright © 2020 Steigmann, Maekawa, Sima, Travan, Wang and Giannobile.	false
0	"A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing. Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic ""socially distant"" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight ""window of opportunity"" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.

0	Safety of bedside placement of tunneled dialysis catheter in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU have high incidence of AKI requiring prolonged renal replacement therapy and often necessitate the placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC). We describe our experience with two cases of COVID-19 patients who underwent successful bedside placement of TDC under ultrasound guidance using anatomical landmarks without fluoroscopy guidance. Tunneled dialysis catheter placement under direct fluoroscopy remains the standard of care; but in well selected patients, placement of tunneled dialysis catheter at the bedside using anatomic landmarks without fluoroscopy can be safely and successfully performed without compromising the quality of care and avoid transfer of COVID-19 infected patients outside the ICU.	false
0	Pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19: a prevalence study in a tertiary hospital. INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, predominantly affects the respiratory tract, and a growing number of publications report the predisposition of patients with COVID-19 to develop thrombotic phenomena., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier., RESULTS: We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of D-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without. Copyright © 2020 SERAM.

0	Depression and anxiety symptoms among returning workers during the COVID-19 period in East China. PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated factors among returning workers with different epidemic experience in East China., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2435 employees from the enterprises located in Deqing (low-risk epidemic area) and Taizhou (high-risk epidemic area) of East China in March 2020. An online questionnaire covered information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as knowledge, attitude, behavior and experience about COVID-19. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were applied to assess depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression and anxiety symptoms associated with risk factors., RESULTS: The participants were aged 36.3 +/- 9.2 years on average, and nearly half of them were female. Overall, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and both were 19.4%, 12.3% and 9.8%, and decreased with age. After adjustment for covariates, 16 or more years of education, being a white-collar worker or working in the high-risk epidemic area were significantly associated with increased risks of both depression and anxiety, in contract regular physical exercise was associated with decreased risks of both mental disorders., CONCLUSION: The depression and anxiety problems were prevalent among returning workers during the COVID-19 period. Targeted psychological interventions should be developed and implemented to improve their mental health.	false
0	Comparison of Quidel Sofia SARS FIA Test to Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA Test for Diagnosis of COVID-19 in Symptomatic Outpatients. The Quidel Sofia SARS FIA test (SOFIA) is a rapid antigen immunoassay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins from nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the SOFIA test to the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA test (APTIMA TMA), a high-throughput molecular diagnostic test that uses transcription mediated amplification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from upper respiratory specimens. Three hundred and 40-seven symptomatic patients, from an urgent care center in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, were tested in parallel using nasal swabs on the SOFIA test and nasopharyngeal swabs on the APTIMA TMA test. The SOFIA test demonstrated an 82.0% positive percent agreement (PPA) compared to the APTIMA TMA test for symptomatic patients tested <= 5 days from symptom onset and a 54.5% PPA for symptomatic patients > 5 days from symptom onset. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was used to determine the cycle threshold (Ct) value from any specimens that were discrepant between the SOFIA and APTIMA TMA tests. Using a Ct value of <= 35 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 culture positivity, we estimate that the SOFIA test detected 87.2% of symptomatic patients tested <= 5 days from symptom onset that were likely to be culture positive.

0	SEIRD model to study the asymptomatic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in India. According to the current perception, symptomatic, presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious persons can infect the healthy population susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, various reports indicate that the number of asymptomatic cases can be several-fold higher than the reported symptomatic cases. In this article, we take the reported cases in India and various states within the country till September 1, as the specimen to understand the progression of the COVID-19. Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19 by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering reported infection primarily due to symptomatic, we compare the model predicted results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would have been much less. Therefore, the current progress of the symptomatic infection can be reduced by quarantining the asymptomatically infectious population via extensive or random testing. This study is motivated strictly toward academic pursuit; this theoretical investigation is not meant for influencing policy decisions or public health practices.

0	A single-dose live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines. Several vaccine platforms are leveraged for a rapid emergency response1. We describe the discovery of a live virus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate using the yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as vector to express a non-cleavable prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. We assess vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in several animal models. Vaccine candidate YF-S0 has an outstanding safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, mice and cynomolgus macaques and concomitantly a protective immunity against YFV. Humoral immunity is complemented by a favourable Th1 cell-mediated immune response as profiled in mice. In a stringent hamster model2 as well as in non-human primates, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in hamsters, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals within 10 days. Taken together, the quality of immune responses triggered and the rapid kinetics by which protective immunity can be mounted already after a single dose warrant further development this potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.	false
0	In vitro Targetability Validation of Peptide-Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles in the Presence of Serum Proteins. Demonstration of receptor-mediated targeting of nanoparticles to specific organs and/or cell types is an integral aim in many bionanomedicine development projects. However, engagement of targeted receptors with ligands on nanocarriers, which is the cornerstone of the active targeting concept, is challenging to study under biologically relevant conditions and thus often stays overlooked. In this work, we utilize an in-house established bioassay for in vitro targetability validation of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), functionalized with high-affinity peptide ligands to somatostatin receptors via protective group chemistry, ensuring the correct orientation of the peptide's pharmacophore. We demonstrate that targeted nanoparticles, but not scrambled peptide-decorated counterparts, specifically engage the targeted receptors in living cells in culture media containing serum protein. The importance of being able to exclude false positives originating from the premature detachment of targeting peptides from the MSNs is highlighted.

Objective: To characterize the hospitalization and death rates among patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to analyze the associations of comorbidities and immunomodulatory medications with infection outcomes. Method(s): Data on clinical and demographic features, maintenance treatment, disease course, and outcomes in individuals with IA (rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis) with symptomatic COVID-19 infection were prospectively assessed via web-based questionnaire followed by individual phone calls and electronic medical record review. Baseline characteristics and medication use were summarized for hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and outcomes with the different medication classes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. Result(s): A total of 103 patients with IA were included in the study (80 with confirmed COVID-19 and 23 with high suspicion of COVID-19). Hospitalization was required in 26% of the participants, and 4% died. Patients who were hospitalized were significantly more likely to be older (P < 0.001) and have comorbid hypertension (P = 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.02). IA patients taking oral glucocorticoids had an increased likelihood of being admitted for COVID-19 (P < 0.001), while those receiving maintenance anticytokine biologic therapies did not. Conclusion(s): Among patients with underlying IA, COVID-19 outcomes were worse in those receiving glucocorticoids but not in patients receiving maintenance anticytokine therapy. Further work is needed to understand whether immunomodulatory therapies affect COVID-19 incidence.Copyright © 2020, American College of Rheumatology	false

0	Performance of three automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays and relevance of orthogonal testing algorithms. Development and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays gained momentum. Laboratories keep on investigating the performance of these assays. In this study, we compared three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. A total of 186 samples from 84 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients and 120 control samples taken before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed using commercial serologic assays from Roche, Siemens and DiaSorin. Time after the positive COVID-19 PCR result and onset of symptoms was retrieved from the medical record. An extended golden standard, using the result of all three assays was defined, judging if antibodies are present or absent in a sample. Diagnostic and screening sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value were calculated. Diagnostic sensitivity (ability to detect a COVID-19 positive patient) >=14 days after positive PCR testing was 96.7% (95% CI 88.5-99.6%) for DiaSorin, 93.3% (95% CI 83.8-98.2%) for Roche and 100% (95% CI 94.0-100%) for Siemens. Lower diagnostic sensitivities were observed <14 days after onset of symptoms for all three assay. Diagnostic specificity (ability to detect a COVID-19 negative patient) was 95.0% (95% CI 89.4-98.1%) for DiaSorin, 99.2% (95% CI 95.4-99.9%) for Roche and 100% (95% CI 97.0-100%) for Siemens. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting antibodies (ability of detecting absence (specificity) or presence (sensitivity) of COVID-19 antibodies) was 92.4% (95% CI 86.4-96.3%)/94.9% (95% CI 90.5-97.6%) for DiaSorin, 97.7% (95% CI 93.5-99.5%)/97.1% (95% CI 93.5-99.1%) for Roche and 98.5% (95% CI 94.6-99.8)/97.1 (95% CI 93.5-99.1%) for Siemens. This study revealed acceptable performance for all three assays. An orthogonal testing algorithm using the Siemens and Roche assay achieved the highest positive predictive values for antibody detection in low seroprevalence settings.

0	Tackling Childhood Stunting in the Eastern Mediterranean Region in the Context of COVID-19. Over 20 million children under 5 years old in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have stunted growth, as a result of chronic malnutrition, with damaging long-term consequences for individuals and societies. This review extracted and analyzed data from the UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank malnutrition estimates to present an overall picture of childhood stunting in the region. The number of children under 5 in the region who are affected by stunting has dropped from 24.5 million (40%) in 1990 to 20.6 million (24.2%) in 2019. The reduction rate since the 2012 baseline is only about two fifths of that required and much more rapid progress will be needed to reach the internationally agreed targets by 2025 and 2030. Prevalence is highest in low-income countries and those with a lower Human Development Index. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine efforts to reduce stunting, through its impact on access and affordability of safe and nutritious foods and access to important health services. Priority areas for action to tackle stunting as part of a comprehensive, multisectoral nutrition strategy are proposed. In light of the threat that COVID-19 will exacerbate the already heavy burden of malnutrition in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, implementation of such strategies is more important than ever.	false

Objectives/Hypothesis: The objective of this meta-analysis was to look at the pooled prevalence of symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging of all COVID-19 infected patients. This will allow better identification of potential COVID-19 patients and take appropriate precautions. Study design: Meta analysis. Method(s): We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid to identify studies published between Dec-2019 and May-2020. All studies reporting upper-aerodigestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection were included. The meta-analysis was conducted following meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, which have evaluated the pooled prevalence of 14 symptoms and nine laboratory investigations. Result(s): Based on inclusion criteria, 67 publications consisting of 8302 patients were included. Among adults, the pooled proportion of hypertensive and diabetic patients was 18% and 7%. Cough (53% [0.46-0.61]), anosmia (38% [0.19-0.58]), loss/distortion of taste (31% [0.17-0.45]), and nasal obstruction (26% [0.12-0.39]) were the most common ear, nose & throat (ENT) symptoms. Fever (69% [0.62-0.76]) and fatigue (31% [0.26-0.37]) were the commonest generalized symptoms. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were raised in 56% (0.41-0.71) and 49% (0.21-0.77), respectively. Interestingly, lymphopenia (41% [0.30-0.53]) and leucopenia (22% [0.16-0.29]) were more common than lymphocytosis (33% [0.02-0.64]) and leucocytosis (12% [0.09-0.16]). Fever (69% vs. 44%), cough (53% vs. 33%), and dyspnea (20% vs. 4%) were more common in adults as compared to the pediatric population. Diarrhea was more common among the pediatric cases (12%) versus (9%). The pooled estimate of fatality was 4%. Conclusion(s): The most commonly experienced ENT symptom was cough followed by anosmia and dysguesia. Raised ESR and CRP with leukopenia and lymphopenia are common laboratory findings. Majority of the infected patients had abnormal computed tomography findings. COVID infection is less severe in pediatric patients.

0	The cardiac complications of COVID-19: many publications, multiple uncertainties. Since the first description of COVID-19 in December 2019, more than 63,000 publications have described its virology, clinical course, management, treatment and prevention. Most physicians are now encountering, or will soon encounter, patients with COVID-19 and must attempt to simultaneously assimilate this avalanche of information while managing an entirely novel disease with few guiding precedents. It is increasingly clear that, although primarily a respiratory illness, COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular complications. However, the true incidence of direct cardiac complications remains unclear, as all complications thus far reported can also occur in patients without COVID-19. In this review, we briefly summarise and critically appraise the data on cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 and describe some cases from our own experience. We identify unresolved questions and highlight the many uncertainties in this developing field. Copyright © 2020 The authors.	false
0	Incidence and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection on solid organ transplantation recipients: A nationwide population-based study. Since February 21 2020, when the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita-ISS) reported the first autochthonous case of infection, a dedicated surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 positive (COVID+) cases has been created in Italy. These data were cross-referenced with those inside the Information Transplant System in order to assess the cumulative incidence (CI) and the outcome of SARS-COV-2 infection in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) which is assumed to be most at risk. We compared our results with those of COVID+ non transplanted patients (Non-SOTRs) with followup through September 30, 2020. The CI of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOTRs was 1.02%, higher than in COVID+ Non-SOTRs (0.4%, p<0.05) with a greater risk in the Lombardy region (2.89%). The CI by kind of organ transplant was higher for heart [CI 1.57%, Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 1.36] and lower for liver [CI 0.63%, IRR 0.54]. The 60dayCI of mortality was 30.6%, twice as much that of COVID+ Non-SOTRs (15.4%) with a 60day gender&age adjusted odds ratio (adjusted-OR) of 3.83 for COVID+ SOTRs [95%CI (3.03-4.85)]. The lowest 60day adjusted-OR was observed in liver SOTRs [OR 0.46, 95%CI (0.25-0.86)]. More detailed studies on disease management and evolution will be necessary in these patients at greater risk of COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Epicardial adipose tissue is associated with extent of pneumonia and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. AIM: We sought to examine the association of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) quantified on chest computed tomography (CT) with the extent of pneumonia and adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective international registry comprising 109 consecutive patients (age 64+/-16years; 62% male) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and noncontrast chest CT imaging. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the burden (%) of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. EAT volume (mL) and attenuation (Hounsfield units) were measured using deep learning software. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death., RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for patient comorbidities, the total burden of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with EAT volume (beta=10.6, p=0.005) and EAT attenuation (beta=5.2, p=0.004). EAT volume correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (r=0.361, p=0.001) and C-reactive protein (r=0.450, p<0.001). Clinical deterioration or death occurred in 23 (21.1%) patients at a median of 3days (IQR 1-13days) following the chest CT. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EAT volume (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.8-14.1] per doubling p=0.011) and EAT attenuation (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5-7.5] per 5 Hounsfield unit increase, p=0.003) were independent predictors of clinical deterioration or death, as was total pneumonia burden (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, p=0.002), chronic lung disease (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7], p=0.011), and history of heart failure (OR 3.5 [95% 1.1-8.2], p=0.037)., CONCLUSIONS: EAT measures quantified from chest CT are independently associated with extent of pneumonia and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19, lending support to their use in clinical risk stratification.

0	Flank Pain as a Symptom of COVID-19. The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect the patients early to prevent the spread of the disease.1,2 We report a case of 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Diagnosis clinical features in patients infected with novel COVID-19 in Iraq. Novel corona virus COVID-19 suspected patients including 50 samples were collected from different hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq during 5th to 25th of March / 2020. Complete blood count including monocyte, hemoglobin, red blood cell, leukocyte, lymphocyte and platelets count, and serum C- reactive protein diagnosed in 20 patients which are positive to novel covide-19 in Iraq hospital. The result showed that the monocyte count average was 1.5 103 / UL, hemoglobin (Hb) count vary from 9 to 14 g/dl, the red blood cell average count was 4.83 106 / UL, leukocyte average was 16.00 103 / UL, the lymphocyte was 2.5 %, the platelet (PLT) average count was 512 H 103 / UL and the C-reactive protein was 19 mg/L. The results showed that the total number of monocyte, hemoglobin (Hb)and red blood cell were slightly decrease or remained normal, while 90% of patients presented the number of leukocytes were highly increased and the percentage of lymphocytes were reduced, platelets count increased in 80 % and the serum CRP was slightly to high increased, except 10 % of patients slightly increase in leukocyte platelets, moderate change in the percentage of lymphocyte and 20% of serum CRP still normal. Blood parameter and serum C-Reactive protein can be an active evaluation index for infectious patients with novel COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019 and type 1 diabetes mellitus. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major comorbidity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but less is known about COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Thus, our goal was to review the literature on COVID and T1DM., RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 21 reports focusing on COVID-19 infections among patients with preexisting T1DM (n = 7), incident T1DM presentations during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 6), and outpatient management of T1DM during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 8). These studies showed that patients with preexisting T1DM and COVID-19 infection often present with hyperglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although the risk of in-hospital mortality may be increased, hospitalization rates among patients with T1DM mirror that of the general population. The numbers of patients presenting with incident T1DM during COVID-19 quarantine have remained stable, but cases with severe DKA may have increased. COVID-19 quarantine has also impacted outpatient T1DM management and studies examining changes in glycemic control have shown mixed results., SUMMARY: COVID-19 has important implications for patients with type 1 diabetes, but additional studies with larger numbers of patients and longer term follow-up are needed to confirm the early findings highlighted in this review.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dental practice in Iran: a questionnaire-based report. BACKGROUND: The highly contagious nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), besides the fact that dental procedures commonly generate blood and saliva droplets that could lead to the contagion have resulted in the closure of many dental clinics. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental practice by conducting an online questionnaire among the Iranian dental practitioners and finding their perspectives on the subject., METHODS: This report is based on a questionnaire that was conducted among Iranian dentists. The survey included questions that evaluate the dentists' perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their personal life, financial status, and the quality of dental services for patients., RESULTS: Overall, 240 dentists contributed to this study (214 general dentists and 26 specialists). The majority of the participants (n = 170, 70%) did not perform non-emergency procedures during the pandemic. The dental practitioners have suggested several strategies to decrease the risk of contagion, such as reducing treatment sessions (n = 90, 37%), strict triage of patients (n = 156, 64%), and using personal protective equipment (n = 108, 45%). However, most of the dentists (n = 210, 87%) had problems, providing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Moreover, 97% (n = 234) of the participants reported that they encountered a decrease in their financial income since the eruption of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: Dental health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, dental practitioners ought to execute the standard protocols more cautiously during the pandemic. They could also lower their work hours and limit dental procedures to emergency treatments to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Besides, the public organizations should provide proper equipment for the dental practitioners to decrease the risk of contagion.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 on rare metabolic patients and healthcare providers: results from two MetabERN surveys. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused disruption in all aspects of daily life, including the management and treatment of rare inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). To perform a preliminary assessment of the incidence of COVID-19 in IMD patients and the impact of the coronavirus emergency on the rare metabolic community between March and April 2020, the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Diseases (MetabERN) has performed two surveys: one directed to patients' organizations (PO) and one directed to healthcare providers (HCPs). The COVID-19 incidence in the population of rare metabolic patients was lower than that of the general European population (72.9 x 100,000 vs. 117 x 100,000). However, patients experienced extensive disruption of care, with the majority of appointments and treatments cancelled, reduced, or postponed. Almost all HCPs (90%) were able to substitute face-to-face visits with telemedicine, about half of patients facing treatment changes switched from hospital to home therapy, and a quarter reported difficulties in getting their medicines. During the first weeks of emergency, when patients and families lacked relevant information, most HCPs contacted their patients to provide them with support and information. Since IMD patients require constant follow-up and treatment adjustments to control their disease and avoid degradation of their condition, the results of our surveys are relevant for national health systems in order to ensure appropriate care for IMD patients. They highlight strong links in an interconnected community of HCPs and PO, who are able to work quickly and effectively together to support and protect fragile persons during crisis. However, additional studies are needed to better appreciate the actual impact of COVID-19 on IMD patients' health and the mid- and long-term effects of the pandemic on their wellbeing.	false
0	Prevalence and predictors of coronaphobia among frontline hospital and public health nurses. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence as well as the predictors of coronaphobia in frontline hospital and public health nurses., DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional research study involving 736 nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals and health units in Region 8, Philippines. Four structured self-report scales were used, including the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and the single-item measure for perceived health., RESULTS: The prevalence of coronaphobia was 54.76% (n = 402): 37.04% (n = 130) in hospital nurses and 70.91% (n = 273) in public health nurses. Additionally, nurses' gender (beta = 0.148, p < .001), marital status (beta = 0.124, p < .001), job status (beta = 0.138, p < .001), and personal resilience (beta = -0.167, p = .002) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. A small proportion of nurses were willing (19.94%, n = 70) and fully prepared (9.40%, n = 33) to manage and care for coronavirus patients., CONCLUSION: Coronaphobia is prevalent among frontline Filipino nurses, particularly among public health nurses. Interventions to address coronaphobia among frontline nurses in the hospital and community should consider the predictors identified. By increasing personal resilience in nurses through theoretically driven intervention, coronaphobia may be alleviated. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers. The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some ad-hoc questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off >12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.© Copyright © 2020 Spinola, Liotti, Speranza and Tambelli.	false
0	Identifying Predictors of Psychological Distress During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach. Scientific understanding about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is in its nascent stage. Prior research suggests that demographic factors, such as gender and age, are associated with greater distress during a global health crisis. Less is known about how emotion regulation impacts levels of distress during a pandemic. The present study aimed to identify predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 2,787) provided demographics, history of adverse childhood experiences, current coping strategies (use of implicit and explicit emotion regulation), and current psychological distress. The overall prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress was higher than the prevalence outside a pandemic and was higher than rates reported among healthcare workers and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Younger participants (<45 years), women, and non-binary individuals reported higher prevalence of symptoms across all measures of distress. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to identify the strongest predictors of distress. Regression trees were developed to identify individuals at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Somatization and less reliance on adaptive defense mechanisms were associated with greater distress. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individuals' physical experiences of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies to help mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a global health crisis.

0	Saliva: an important alternative for screening and monitoring of COVID-19 in children. The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide poses challenges to healthcare systems not only in effectively identifying individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, but also in isolating cases to minimise contagion in early diagnosing more severe cases that will need hospitalization. Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence. Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children. Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults. Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces. In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasaki's disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults. In view of this scenario, the aim of this study was to present saliva as an alternative for seeking diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19 in children, including adequate sample collection techniques for different age groups.	false
0	Tracking COVID-19 using taste and smell loss Google searches is not a reliable strategy. Web search tools are widely used by the general public to obtain health-related information, and analysis of search data is often suggested for public health monitoring. We analyzed popularity of searches related to smell loss and taste loss, recently listed as symptoms of COVID-19. Searches on sight loss and hearing loss, which are not considered as COVID-19 symptoms, were used as control. Google Trends results per region in Italy or state in the US were compared to COVID-19 incidence in the corresponding geographical areas. The COVID-19 incidence did not correlate with searches for non-symptoms, but in some weeks had high correlation with taste and smell loss searches, which also correlated with each other. Correlation of the sensory symptoms with new COVID-19 cases for each country as a whole was high at some time points, but decreased (Italy) or dramatically fluctuated over time (US). Smell loss searches correlated with the incidence of media reports in the US. Our results show that popularity of symptom searches is not reliable for pandemic monitoring. Awareness of this limitation is important during the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread and to exhibit new clinical manifestations, and for potential future health threats.	false
0	Venom immunotherapy during COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from a University Allergy Center in Northern Italy. During the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) allergic patients need to continue their constant and proper treatment, including allergen-specific immunotherapy. These patients are expected to be at a higher risk for exacerbation of lung inflammation during viral infection. We investigated the putative interplay existing between allergen-specific immunotherapy and COVID-19 infection in a Hymenoptera venom-allergic population. We evaluated the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of 211 subjects referring to our center for the regular administration of venom immunotherapy (VIT). Our result showed that the median age of our cohort is similar to the one that in our region has been associated with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, increased hospitalization, and mortality rates. We reported only an isolated positivity of COVID-19 in the overall group; whereas none suffered from upper airway symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, anosmia, and/or ageusia). Even though the demographic characteristics pose a substantial risk for such a population, we suggest that a regular administration of VIT may help in the development of an immunological milieu able to down modulate the Th1/Th17 environment that has been linked to inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the incidence of COVID-19 infection in Hymenoptera venom allergic patients treated with VIT, suggesting indirectly that venom immune tolerance-inducing treatment may be capable of reducing the aberrant inflammatory response induced by the virus in this specific population.

0	[The impact of lung diseases, smoking and e-cigarette use on the severity of COVID-19 illness at diagnosis]. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health and economic turmoil across the globe. Severe COVID-19 disease most often presents with pneumonia and complications in acutely ill patients often stem from the lungs. The associations of lung disease, smoking and e-cigarette use with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are unclear on a population level., METHODS: Data on 1761 patients from the Icelandic outpatient Landspitali COVID-19 Clinic were used. The prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use and underlying lung diseases was calculated in the cohort, with stratification based on age groups and a clinical classification of symptom severity. It was tested whether these prevalences differed between age groups and classes of symptom severity., RESULTS: Most patients were in the age group between 35-54 years of age and a large majority had mild symptoms at diagnosis. The prevalence of smoking was 6% with the highest prevalence among 35-54 year olds. The prevalence of e-cigarette use was 4%. It was most prevalent in the age group between 18-34 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of smoking or e-cigarette use between classes of symptom severity. The prevalence of lung disease was 9%. It was higher among older patients and patients with more severe symptoms., CONCLUSION: The age distribution and prevalence of lung disease and their risk factors are described in the context of COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity in a whole-nation cohort of Icelanders. The cohort is younger and had less severe symptoms than in many previosly published studies of COVID-19. Interestingly, the prevalences of smoking and e-cigarette use were lower than in the Icelandic general population and they were not associated with symptom severity at diagnosis. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that underlying lung diseases are prevalent among people with severe COVID-19 symptoms but fail to demonstrate an association between cigarette smoking or e-cigarette smoking with COVID-19 severity.	false
0	Crowding Effects Dominate Demographic Attributes in COVID-19 Cases. Objective: With an eye toward possible public policy implications, our objective is to identify the socio-economic and demographic factors that drive the large variation in COVID-19 incidence rates observed within relatively compact geographic regions, and to quantify the relative impact of each of these factors. We use international comparisons as a starting point. Method(s): New York City, consisting of some 175 zip codes, is an ideal arena to pursue the above study given the large variation in case incidence rates across zip codes. We conducted systematic regression studies employing data with zip code granularity. Our model specifications are based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0. Result(s): Average household size emerges as the single most important driver behind the large variation in COVID-19 incidence rates. It independently explains 62% of the variation. The percentage of the population above the age of 65 and the percentage below the poverty line are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates. As to ethnic/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics and Asians within the population are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) Contrary to common belief, population density, by itself, does not have a significantly positive impact (other than when a high population is driven by large household sizes). Conclusion(s): Our findings support implemented and proposed policies to quarantine patients and separate infected individuals from families or dormitories; they also support newly revised nursing home admission policies.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Design and rationale of an intelligent algorithm to detect BuRnoUt in HeaLthcare workers in COVID era using ECG and artificiaL intelligence: The BRUCEE-LI study. Background: There is no large contemporary data from India to see the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in covid era. Burnout and mental stress is associated with electrocardiographic changes detectable by artificial intelligence (AI). Objective(s): The present study aims to estimate the prevalence of burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era using Mini Z-scale and to develop predictive AI model to detect burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era. Method(s): This is an observational and cross-sectional study to evaluate the presence of burnout in HCWs in academic tertiary care centres of North India in the COVID-19 era. At least 900 participants will be enrolled in this study from four leading premier government-funded/public-private centres of North India. Each study centre will be asked to recruit HCWs by approaching them through various listed ways for participation in the study. Interested participants after initial screening and meeting the eligibility criteria, will be asked to fill the questionnaire (having demographic and work related with Mini Z questionnaire) to assess burnout. The healthcare workers will include physicians at all levels of training, nursing staff and paramedical staff who are involved directly or indirectly in COVID-19 care. The analysis of the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data and development of algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be done by experts. Conclusion(s): In Summary, we propose that ECG data generated from the people with burnout can be utilized to develop AI-enabled model to predict the presence of stress and burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era.Copyright © 2020 Cardiological Society of India	false
0	Role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients and Predictors of Mortality. BACKGROUND: The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Our study aims to analyze the outcomes and risk factors from patients treated with ECMO., METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, single-center study includes 17 COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Univariate and multivariate parametric survival regression identified predictors of survival. Nine patients (53%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged. The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 47%. In a univariate analysis, only four out of 83 pre-ECMO variables were significantly different; IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. The Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) score was significantly higher in survivors. After a multivariate parametric survival regression, IL-6, NT-proBNP and RESP scores remained significant independent predictors, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.069 [95%-CI: 0.986-1.160], p= 0.016 1.001 [95%-CI: 1.000-1.001], p=0.012; and 0.843 [95%-CI: 0.564-1.260], p=0.040, respectively. A prediction model comprising IL-6, NT-proBNP, and RESP score showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, with a sensitivity of 87.5% and 77.8% specificity compared to an AUC of 0.79 for the RESP score alone., CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that ECMO is a potentially lifesaving treatment for selected critically ill COVID-19 patients. Considering IL-6 and NT-per-BNP, in addition to the RESP score, may enhance outcome predictions. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 905 COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex in the Capital City of Tehran, Iran. BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 905 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (IKHC), Tehran, Iran., METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited based on clinical symptoms and patterns of computed tomography (CT) imaging between February 20 and March 19. All patients were tested for the presence of COVID-19 RNA. The Poisson regression model estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for different parameters., RESULTS: The average age (+/- standard deviation) was 56.9 (+/-15.7) years and 61.77% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (93.59%), dry cough (79.78%), and dyspnea (75.69%). Only 43.76% of patients were positive for the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. Prevalence of lymphopenia was 42.9% and more than 90% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or C-reactive protein (CRP). About 11% were severe cases, and 13.7% died in the hospital. The median length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. We found higher risks of mortality in patients who were older than 70 years (IRR = 11.77, 95% CI 3.63-38.18), underwent mechanical ventilation (IRR = 7.36, 95% CI 5.06-10.7), were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (IRR = 5.47, 95% CI 4.00-8.38), tested positive on the COVID-19 test (IRR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.64-3.55), and reported a history of comorbidity (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.89) compared to their corresponding reference groups. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was not associated with mortality in our study., CONCLUSION: Older age, experiencing a severe form of the disease, and having a comorbidity were the most important prognostic factors for COVID-19 infection.

0	COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS): protocol for an observational study using linked Scottish national data. INTRODUCTION: The effects of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are not fully delineated. We will describe the incidence of COVID-19 in pregnancy at population level in Scotland, in a prospective cohort study using linked data. We will determine associations between COVID-19 and adverse pregnancy, neonatal and maternal outcomes and the proportion of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates associated with maternal COVID-19., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective cohort study using national linked data sets. We will include all women in Scotland, UK, who were pregnant on or became pregnant after, 1 March 2020 (the date of the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland) and all births in Scotland from 1 March 2020 onwards. Individual-level data will be extracted from data sets containing details of all livebirths, stillbirth, terminations of pregnancy and miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies treated in hospital or attending general practice. Records will be linked within the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, which includes primary care records, virology and serology results and details of COVID-19 Community Hubs and Assessment Centre contacts and deaths. We will perform analyses using definitions for confirmed, probable and possible COVID-19 and report serology results (where available). Outcomes will include congenital anomaly, miscarriage, stillbirth, termination of pregnancy, preterm birth, neonatal infection, severe maternal disease and maternal deaths. We will perform descriptive analyses and appropriate modelling, adjusting for demographic and pregnancy characteristics and the presence of comorbidities. The cohort will provide a platform for future studies of the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions and immunisations for COVID-19 and their effects on childhood and developmental outcomes., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland is a substudy of EAVE II(, which has approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee. Findings will be reported to Scottish Government, Public Health Scotland and published in peer-reviewed journals. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

0	Coronary artery disease in patients hospitalised with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. OBJECTIVE: Among patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), coronary artery disease (CAD) has been identified as a high-risk condition. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes and mortality among patients with COVID-19 according to CAD status., METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Cremona Hospital (Lombardy region, Italy) between February and March 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. CAD was defined as a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CAD that was being medically treated., RESULTS: Of 1252 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 124 (9.9%) had concomitant CAD. Patients with CAD were older and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities compared with those without CAD. Although patients with CAD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality than patients without CAD (HR 3.01, 95% CI 2.27 to 3.99), this difference was no longer significant in the adjusted model (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63). Results were consistent among patients with prior MI (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.41), prior PCI (aHR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.62), prior CABG (aHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.82), or CAD medically treated (aHR 0.84, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.44). Multivariable analysis showed that age (aHR per 5 year increase 1.62, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.72) and female sex (aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82) were the only two independent correlates of mortality., CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 and CAD have an exceedingly higher risk of mortality, which is mainly attributable to the burden of comorbidities rather than to a direct effect of CAD per se.

0	Spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in children during high peak COVID-19 period infection in Northern Italy: is there a link?. BACKGROUND: Children with COVID-19 have a milder clinical course than adults. We describe the spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations during a COVID-19 outbreak in Emilia-Romagna, Italy., METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter study including all diagnosis of KD, myocarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from February to April,2020. KD patients were compared to those diagnosed before the epidemic., RESULTS: KD: 8 patients (6/8 boys, all negative for SARS-CoV-2); complete presentation in 5/8; 7/8 IVIG-responders; 3/8 showed transient coronary lesions (CALs)., MYOCARDITIS: one 5-year-old girl negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for Parvovirus B19. She responded to IVIG., MIS-C: 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive boys (3 patients with positive swab and serology, 1 patient with negative swab and positive serology). Three presented myocardial dysfunction and pericardial effusion, one developed multicoronary aneurysms and hyperinflammation; all responded to treatment. The fourth boy had mitral and aortic regurgitation that rapidly regressed after steroids., CONCLUSIONS: KD, myocarditis and MIS-C were distinguishable cardiovascular manifestations. KD did not show a more aggressive form compared to previous years: coronary involvement was frequent, but always transient. MIS-C and myocarditis rapidly responded to treatment without cardiac sequelae despite high markers of myocardial injury at onset suggesting a myocardial depression due to systemic inflammation rather than focal necrosis. Evidence of actual or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented only in patients with MIS-C. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in India and modelling optimal lockdown exit strategies. India imposed one of the world's strictest population-wide lockdown on 25 March 2020 for COVID-19. We estimated epidemiological parameters, evaluated the effect of control measures on the epidemic in India and explored strategies to exit lockdown. We obtained patient-level data to estimate the delay from onset to confirmation and the asymptomatic proportion. We estimated the basic and time-varying reproduction number (R0 and Rt)after adjusting for imported cases and delay to confirmation, using incidence data from 4 March to 25 April 2020. Using a SEIR-QDPA model, we simulated lockdown relaxation scenarios and increased testing to evaluate lockdown exit strategies. R0 for India was estimated to be 2.08 while the Rt decreased from 1.67 on 30 March to 1.16 on 22 April. We observed that the delay from date of lockdown relaxation to start of second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak- this delay is longer if lockdown is relaxed gradually. Aggressive measures like lockdowns may be inherently enough to suppress an outbreak, however other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Lower levels of social distancing when coupled with a testing ramp-up, could achieve similar outbreak control as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased.

0	[Prediction of end of lockdown post-peak of cases in first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile]. Introduction: The results of mandatory confinement have been detrimental in several respects. Nonetheless, they have resulted in reducing the number of active cases of COVID-19. Chile has begun the de-escalation and needs to know the best time to end the restrictions., Objective: We discuss the best conditions and guarantees for the end of compulsory confinement., Methods: This study is based on a trend model with prediction estimation. The data of the variables of interest were subjected to linear regression studies to determine the curve that best explained the data. The coefficient of determination, the standard deviation of y in x, and the confidence interval of the observed curve were estimated. The trend curve was chosen in accordance with the regression estimates., Outcomes: It was found that all dependent variables tended to decrease over time in a quadratic fashion, except for the new cases variable. In general, the R2 and MAPE estimates are satisfactory, except for the variable number of PCR tests per day., Conclusions: Gradual and cautious steps should be taken before ending mandatory confinement. In the current de-escalator, daily PCR tests should be increased, maintaining vigilance on indicators of incidence, prevalence, and positivity of PCR tests. Evidence suggests with some degree of confidence that mandatory confinement could be safely lifted as of August 30, 2020. Long-term preparations must be made to contain future waves of new cases.	false
0	Characteristics and effectiveness of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) prevention and control in a representative city in china. Background: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic. Control measures differ among countries. It is necessary to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. Material/Methods: We collected the data of COVID-19 patients and control measures between January 18, 2020 and September 18, 2020 from the Changshou District and analyzed the clinical characteristics, epidemiological data, and the adjustment of policies to assess the effectiveness of control measures. The control of COVID-19 was divided into 2 stages, with the lifting of lockdown in Hubei province (March 25, 2020) as a dividing line. Result(s): We identified 32 patients through different means in the first stage. All the imported patients entered this area before the lockdown. In 93.1% of patients, the last exposure occurred before the implementation of the stay-at-home order and centralized isolation. Tracing of high-risk people and RT-PCR screening identified 56.3% of cases. In the second stage, all the high-risk people were under centralized isolation. Nine asymptomatic patients were identified. City lockdown and stay-at-home orders were not issued again, and no second-generation patients were found. Conclusion(s): We have provided a successful model to control the transmission of COVID-19 in a short period. Copyright © Med Sci Monit, 2020.	false
0	A model for the incremental burden of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b due to a decline of childhood vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak: A dynamic transmission model in Japan. BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a persistent decline in childhood vaccination coverage, including Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, in some countries. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan., METHODS: Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses., RESULTS: While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years., CONCLUSIONS: The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Impact of pre-existing immunity to influenza on live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Laiv) immunogenicity. During the previous influenza seasons, between 2010 and 2016, the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) provided variable efficacy against influenza in the U.S., causing the recommendation against the use of the LAIV. In striking contrast, pre-clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated superior efficacy of LAIV against mismatched influenza viruses, compared to inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). This disparity in reported vaccine efficacies between pre-clinical and clinical studies may in part be explained by limitations of the animal models of influenza. In particular, the absence of pre-existing immunity in animal models has recently emerged as a potential explanation for the discrepancies between preclinical findings and human studies. This commentary focuses on the potential impact of pre-existing immunity on LAIV induced immunogenicity with an emphasis on cross-protective immunity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	"Endothelial eNAMPT Amplifies Preclinical Acute Lung Injury: Efficacy of an eNAMPT-Neutralising mAb. RATIONALE: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the serious unmet need for effective therapies that reduce ARDS mortality. We explored whether extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and a master regulator of innate immunity and inflammation, is a potential ARDS therapeutic target., METHODS: Wild type C57BL/6J or endothelial cell (EC)-cNAMPT -/- knockout mice (targeted EC NAMPT deletion) were exposed to either a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (""one-hit"") or a combined LPS/ventilator (""two-hit"")-induced acute inflammatory lung injury model. A NAMPT-specific mAb imaging probe (99mTc-ProNamptorTM) was used to detect NAMPT expression in lung tissues. Either an eNAMPT-neutralising goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) or a humanised monoclonal antibody (ALT-100 mAb) were utilised in vitro and in vivo., RESULTS: Immunohistochemical, biochemical, and imaging studies validated time-dependent increases in NAMPT lung tissue expression in both preclinical ARDS models. Intravenous delivery of either eNAMPT-neutralising pAb/mAb significantly attenuated inflammatory lung injury (H & E staining, BAL protein, BAL PMNs, plasma IL-6) in both preclinical models. In vitro human lung EC studies demonstrated eNAMPT-neutralising antibodies (pAb, mAb) to strongly abrogate eNAMPT-induced TLR4 pathway activation and EC barrier disruption. In vivo studies in wild type and EC-cNAMPT -/- mice confirmed a highly significant contribution of EC-derived NAMPT to the severity of inflammatory lung injury in both preclinical ARDS models., CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight both the role of EC-derived eNAMPT and the potential for biologic targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway. In combination with predictive eNAMPT biomarker and NAMPT genotyping assays, this offers the opportunity to identify high-risk ARDS subjects for delivery of personalised medicine.

0	An Organoid-derived Bronchioalveolar Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Human Alveolar-type II-like Cells. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. The alveolar epithelium is a major target of the virus, but representative models to study virus host interactions in more detail are currently lacking. Here, we describe a human 2D air-liquid interface culture system which was characterized by confocal-, electron-microscopy and single cell mRNA expression analysis. In this model, alveolar cells, but also basal cells and rare neuroendocrine cells, are grown from 3D self-renewing fetal lung bud tip organoids. These cultures were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 with mainly surfactant protein C-positive alveolar type II-like cells being targeted. Consequently, significant viral titers were detected and mRNA expression analysis revealed induction of type I/III interferon response program. Treatment of these cultures with a low dose of interferon lambda 1 reduced viral replication. Hence, these cultures represent an experimental model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be applied for drug screens. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Comparison of Infection Risks and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 Lung Infection under Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System Blockade - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. AIM: ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Animal studies suggest that RAAS blockers might increase the expression of ACE2 and potentially increase the risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of ACE inhibitor (ACEi) treatment on the pneumonia incidence in non-COVID-19 patients (25 studies, 330,780 patients) was associated with a 26% reduction of pneumonia risk (OR: 0.74, p<0.001). Pneumonia related death cases in ACEi treated non-COVID-19 patients were reduced by 27% (OR: 0.73, p=0.004). However, ARB treatment (10 studies, 275,621 non-COVID-19 patients) did not alter pneumonia risk in patients. Pneumonia related death cases in ARBs treated non-COVID-19 patients was analysed only in one study and was significantly reduced (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.72). Results from 11 studies (8.4 million patients) showed that the risk of getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reduced by 13% (OR: 0.87, p=0.014) in patients treated with ACEi, whereas analysis from 10 studies (8.4 million patients) treated with ARBs showed no effect (OR, 0.92, p=0.354). Results from 34 studies in 67,644 COVID-19 patients showed that RAAS blockade reduces all-cause mortality by 24% (OR=0.76, p=0.04). CONCLUSION(S): ACEi reduces the risk of getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Blocking the RAAS may decrease all cause mortality in COVID-19 patients. ACE inhibitors do reduce the risk of non-COVID pneumonia. All cause mortality due to non-COVID pneumonia is reduced by ACEi and potentially by ARBs.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	COVID-19 in hospitalized patients in Spain: a cohort study in Madrid. Few large series describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes and costs of COVID-19 in western countries. This cohort reports the first 1,255 adult cases who received anti-COVID-19 treatment at a Spanish hospital from March 1 to 24, 2020. The cost of treatment was calculated. Logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors present on admission associated with ARDS. Bivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio model was employed to determine the hazard ratio (HR) between individual factors and death. We included 1,255 patients (median age 65 years; 57.8% male), of which 92.3% required hospitalization. Prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus was 45.1%, 31.4%, and 19.9%, respectively. Lymphocytopenia (54.8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (33.0%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (58.5%) were frequent. Overall, 36.7% of patients developed ARDS, 10.0% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 21.3% died. Most frequent antiviral combinations used were lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine (44.2%), followed by triple therapy with beta-interferon 1b (32.5%). Corticosteroids and tocilizumab were used in 25.2% and 12.9% of patients, respectively. The total cost of anti-COVID-19 agents was 511,825 (408 per patient). In the multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with ARDS included older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, severe hypoxemia, lymphocytopenia, increased creatine kinase and increased C-reactive protein. In the multivariate Cox model, older age (HR 1.07 -95%CI 1.06-1.09), cardiovascular disease (HR 1.34 -95%CI 1.01-1.79), diabetes mellitus (HR 1.45 -95%CI 1.09-1.92), severe hypoxemia (HR 2.01 -95%CI 1.49-2.72), lymphocytopenia (HR 1.62 -95%CI 1.20-2.20) and increased C-reactive protein (HR 1.04 -95%CI 1.02-1.06) were risk factors for mortality.

0	Cardiac Adverse Events With Remdesivir in COVID-19 Infection. Since December 2019, coronavirus has gradually progressed to a pandemic with no efficacious treatment. Remdesivir is an antiviral medication and inhibitor of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase with inhibitory action against SARS-CoV virus. Two patients diagnosed with coronavirus infection with worsening respiratory status were initiated with multimodality therapy with antibiotics, steroids and remdesivir. After initiation of remdesivir, the patients' developed bradycardia, with one of the two also showing signs of worsening QT interval. This reverted upon stopping remdesvir therapy. The prevalence of bradycardia with prolonged QT interval is not well-known yet with this medication. Copyright © 2020, Gupta et al.	false
0	An unusual COVID-19 case with over four months of viral shedding in the presence of low neutralizing antibodies: a case report. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, causing social and economic disasters in many countries. In China, two-consecutive negative results of nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory samples are required to end the quarantine of COVID-19 patients. However, clinicians face a dilemma in case of patients with long-term viral shedding. This report described an unusual COVID-19 case who had persistent viral RNA positivity for more than 4 months after initial illness in the presence of low neutralizing antibodies, but without prolonged clinical symptoms. Multiple anti-viral drug treatments had no impact and there was no evidence of re-infection. When the patient was self-quarantined at home, no infection occurred to the three family members living with her for 15 to 19 days. Sputum viral culture in BSL-3 laboratory on the 102 nd day after symptom onset was negative. From the 129 th day on, 8 continuous nucleic acid tests of sputum samples showed negative results. The patient was discharged on 137 th days since symptom onset. In conclusion, viral RNA shedding in the sputum of the COVID-19 patient may last over 4 months. As no evidence shows the existence of infectious virus, two-consecutive negative nucleic acid tests may not be the prerequisite for ending quarantine of COVID-19 patients with prolonged viral shedding.	false
0	Rethinking gain-of-function experiments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Proponents of the use of gain-of-function (GOF) experiments with pathogens with pandemic potential (PPP) have argued that such experiments are necessary because they reveal important facets of pathogenesis and can be performed safely. Opponents of GOF experiments with PPP have argued that the risks outweigh the knowledge gained. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the vulnerability of human societies to a new PPP, while also validating some arguments of both camps, questioning others, and suggesting the need to rethink how we approach this class of experiments.Copyright © 2020 Imperiale and Casadevall.	false
0	Improving the early diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19: A retrospective study of 106 patients. Introduction: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This study aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 to better differentiate the suspected patients in Beijing, China. Methodology: This was a retrospective, single-center study. Clinical and epidemiologic data were collected from suspected patients with COVID-19 admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 29 to February 21, 2020. Result(s): One hundred and six patients (60 males and 46 females, median age 36 years) were enrolled. Thirty-six patients were ultimately laboratory confirmed. Fifty-three were excluded from the diagnosis of COVID-19. The remaining 17 patients were highly suspected, although their nucleic acid tests were repeatedly negative. The confirmed patients and highly suspected patients had a significantly higher proportion of epidemiologic history than the excluded patients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms or the underlying diseases among the three groups. The confirmed patients had a higher frequency of lymphopenia and eosinopenia than the highly suspected and excluded patients. Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral lung involvement, and ground-glass opacity was more likely observed in the confirmed patients. Conclusion(s): The clinical features of the confirmed patients with COVID-19 were insufficient for early diagnosis of COVID-19. The epidemiologic history was of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. More sensitive diagnostic methods are needed to aid the differential diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Gao et al.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 serological testing changes disease management in a PCR-negative patient. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers worldwide have faced many obstacles in the diagnostic evaluation of patients for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative virus. Even with the application of statistical inference by Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of a diagnosis, with and without testing capabilities, some cases may still carry a degree of uncertainty. This has important implications for limiting the spread of disease. The basis for isolation and quarantine is a known diagnosis. This case is an example of a diagnostic conundrum that required more thorough use of testing methods, particularly serological testing, to guide the isolation recommendations for a patient with COVID-19. This will be helpful to other diagnosticians by providing an example of how serological findings may be effectively applied in the course of individual COVID-19 management.Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

0	COVID-19 infection recurrence presenting with meningoencephalitis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can involve many organs, such as central nervous system, including in relapse. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19-induced respiratory distress whose treatment resulted in a negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result for COVID-19. However, after a few weeks, relapse occurred, as indicated by symptoms of acute meningoencephalitis. Results of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing from her cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspiration specimens became positive again, but COVID-19 serum antibodies were negative. We therefore note that symptoms with neurologic involvement can be one of COVID-19's first presentations, or they can appear at relapse. Regular evaluation of patients during convalescence is therefore necessary.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients in the outdoor setting. In a brief span of a few months, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a major paradigm shift in operation of clinical services around the world. Infection may be mild, moderate or severe; many remain asymptomatic. High burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases theoretically puts Pakistani population at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Considering the universal risk of infection, the outpatient services in Pakistan need to be redesigned. Starting with risk assessment of the facility and provision of a dedicated telephone connection, structure and workflow need to be redesigned in order to minimise risk of exposure to healthcare professionals, staff and patients. Patients with COVID-19 patients should be identified before they arrive in the facility and should be served expeditiously, in an environment which prevents cross-transmission of infection. Tele-consultation is assuming an important role. Changes which are taking place in response to Covid-19 pandemic will have far reaching effects on clinical services in Pakistan.Copyright © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association.

0	Commercial Serology Assays Predict Neutralization Activity Against SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether a positive serology result correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. METHOD(S): A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULT(S): The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): These three clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. All SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients develop neutralizing antibodies.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.	false
0	Epidemiology and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults. A number of patients with pneumonitis infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been detected since December 2019. The initial reported patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and children had low incidence and were not susceptible. As the number of children infected gradually increased, the infection spread to premature babies, infants and young children, and severe cases in children have now occurred. Susceptibility characteristics of the entire population have been identified in the latest diagnosis and treatment plan. At present, the proportion of children affected by the disease is relatively low, but it still deserves enough attention. The epidemiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults is unclear, and there is no specific drug for treatment, which brings great difficulties to epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment. Early identification of epidemiological characteristics and effective treatment with drugs are the key to preventing and controlling this new epidemic. This article analyzes the pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic in children and adults, differences in the incidence, and the current status of treatment. Last it explores possible causes and possible effective treatment measures.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences). All right reserved.	false
0	Serum pooling for rapid expansion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing capacity. OBJECTIVES: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity., METHODS: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches., RESULTS: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors. Copyright © 2020.

Material(s) and Method(s): ESC were tested by bulk or single cell (sc) RNAseq after 72 hr exposures to 0-300 mM hyperosmotic sorbitol (with stemness-maintaining Leukemia Inhibitory Factor, LIF) to quantify stress-forced differentiation. Controls for normal stemness were LIF+ and normal differentiation were LIF-. RNA was isolated by RNAeasy lysis or 10XGenomics Dropseq, RNA quality was checked by Agilent TapeStation, cDNA was synthesized using Lexogen's QuantSeq library kit, and barcoded, multiplexed and sequenced by Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Data were demultiplexed by CASAVA software and FC expression was compared between conditions. In triplicate experiments, significant fold change (FC) genes (FC>=2; FDR<=0.05, P<0.05) identified affected pathways. Proliferation or death were assayed by Hoechst staining or Trypan blue staining, respectively. Validating studies including qPCR. Result(s): Using bulk RNAseq it was shown that VIM and TMPRSS2, two genes necessary for Covid-19 cell uptake are up-regulated significantly as measured by P-value and FDR. VIM is up-regulated 5.6 fold higher at 300 mM sorbitol compared with normal differentiation and TMPRSS2 is also up-regulated 3.1 fold higher by high sorbitol despite LIF presence. Havcr1 the hepatitis A virus receptor was up-regulated 55 fold over normal ESC differentiation with significance by p-Value and FDR. Pvrl1 the Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor was up-regulated 4.5 fold compared with ESC undergoing normal differentiation by LIF removal. Conclusion(s): These are proof-of-principle studies that suggest that some viruses have high susceptibility when ESC and their progeny differentiated lineages undergo hyperosmotic stress. HSV1 is known to cross the placenta, and recent data suggest that Covid-19 may cross the placenta and induce IgM detected in cord blood. We intend to extend these tests using Phthalates and cortisol and to test human embryonic stem cells for similar stress-enhanced susceptibility.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Sudden onset, acute loss of taste and smell in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Early detection, isolation and management of COVID-19 are crucial to contain the current pandemic. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. RESULT(S): Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine.	false
0	"The diagnostic value of joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV in 2019-nCoV infection. Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in 2019-nCoV infection. Method(s): This is a retrospective study. Serum samples were collected from 284 patients including outpatients and inpatients in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20 to February 17 in 2020. Among them 205 cases were 2019-nCoV infected patients, including 186 cases confirmed with nucleic acid test and 19 cases diagnosed by clinical symptoms and CT characteristics according to ""the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Control Protocol (5th edition)"". A total of 79 subjects with other diseases but negative to 2019-nCoV infection were recruited as control group. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were measured with fully automated immunoassay technology for all subjects. Statistical significance between 2019-nCoV antibodies test and 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was determined using the chi2 tests. Result(s): The sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were 70.24%(144/205) and 96.10%(197/205) respectively and the specificity were 96.20%(76/79) and 92.41%(73/79) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV antibodies were 95.63%(197/206) and 91.03% (71/78) respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were 100%(186/186) and 80.61%(79/98) respectively. The total coincidence rate of diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection between antibody tests and nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV were 88.03%(250/284). Conclusion(s): Joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV is an effective screening and diagnostic indicators for 2019-nCoV infection, and an effective complement to the false negative results to nucleic acid test.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association."	false
0	Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increasingly reported in seriously ill patients with COVID-19 infection. Incidence of VTE has been reported before and results varied widely in study cohorts., AREA OF UNCERTAINTY: Incidence of major VTE (segmental pulmonary embolism and above and proximal deep vein thrombosis) which is a contributor to mortality and morbidity is not known. Also, data is unclear on the optimal anticoagulation regimen to prevent VTE., DATA SOURCES: Multiple databases including PubMed were searched until May 12, 2020, to include studies reporting VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. MOOSE guidelines were followed in selection, and 11 studies were included. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VTE burden in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and potential benefits of therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation compared with prophylaxis dosing for VTE prevention., THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Many societies and experts recommend routine prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin for VTE prevention in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this meta-analysis, the pooled rate of major VTE was 12.5% in hospitalized patients and 17.2% in intensive care unit patients. When therapeutic anticoagulation dosing was compared with prophylactic anticoagulation, the pooled odds ratio of VTE was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.75; P = 0.008, I = 0%) suggesting statistical significance with therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation for primary prevention of VTE in all hospitalized patients. However, this should be interpreted with caution as the bleeding events and safety profile could not be ascertained because of lack of adequate information. We recommend applying this finding to hospitalized COVID 19 patients only after carefully weighing individual bleeding risks and benefits., CONCLUSION: Major VTE events, especially pulmonary embolism, seem to be high in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Therapeutic anticoagulation dosing seems to significantly benefit the odds of preventing any VTE when compared with prophylactic dosing in all hospitalized patients.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 spike D614G variant confers enhanced replication and transmissibility. During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic 1 . However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human ACE2, (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro , it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo , particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.	false
0	"The psychological impact on an orthopaedic outpatient setting in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the coronavirus claimed 4628 lives worldwide. Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. RESULT(S): A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. ""Work adjustments"" (74.2%), ""changes in personal plans"" (72.6%), and finding it ""confining"" (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, ""financial concerns"" garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). CONCLUSION(S): The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19."	false
0	Why do children seem to be more protected against COVID-19? A hypothesis. Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Sleep Disturbance and Psychological Profiles of Medical Staff and Non-Medical Staff During the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Objective: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably burdened the healthcare system in the Hubei Province, the most severely affected region in China. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare workers in Hubei. Method(s): A total of 2737 healthcare workers were sampled using a two-dimensional code shared online between Mar 4 and Mar 9, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of three elements: baseline characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome variables were PQSI, anxiety and depression scores of non-medical staff, non-frontline medical staff and frontline medical staff. Binary logistical regression analyses were used to compare between respondents with and without sleep disturbance. Result(s): About 61.6% of the respondents reported sleep problems, 22.6% experienced anxiety, and 35% exhibited depressive symptoms. The prevalence of sleep disorders was higher among the frontline healthcare workers compared to the non-frontline and non-medical staff, while anxiety and depression were prevalent in the entire cohort. Logistic regression analysis identified medical occupation, family burden, bereavement, anxiety, and depression as significantly predictive of poor sleep quality. Conclusion(s): Frontline medical staff are more vulnerable to sleep disturbances. Psychosocial interventions are needed to help allied healthcare personnel to better respond to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.© Copyright © 2020 Wang, Song, Xia, He, Tang, Hou and Lei.	false
0	Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis during Covid-19 pandemic. Background: The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objective(s): To determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of the studied event (HAIE) during the study period was calculated by Poisson distribution. Result(s): Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.3/patient-month during the same calender months in the previous 5 years (p=0.033). Two cases presented during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with methylprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. Two patients died during hospital admission. Conclusion(s): The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification. BACKGROUND: Rapid, reliable, and widespread testing is required to curtail the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor., METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples., RESULTS: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using three readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had accuracies greater than 90%., CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19.

0	Robust and Specific Secretory IgA Against SARS-CoV-2 Detected in Human Milk. The SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk has not yet been examined, although protecting infants and young children from COVID-19 is critical for limiting community transmission and preventing serious illness and death. Here, milk samples from eight COVID-19-recovered and seven COVID-19-suspected donors were tested for antibody (Ab) binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. All samples exhibited significant specific IgA reactivity to the full Spike, whereas 80% exhibited significant IgA and secretory (s)Ab binding to the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Additionally, 67% samples exhibited IgG and/or IgM binding to RBD. IgA and sAb titers were highly correlated, indicating most IgA to be sIgA. Overall, these data indicate that a robust sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in human milk after infection should be expected in a significant majority of individuals. Further research is highly warranted to determine Ab functionality and the potential for exploiting extracted milk sIgA for therapeutic use. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	Rhino-Orbital Mucormycosis Associated With COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections may be associated with a wide range of bacterial and fungal co-infections. We report the case of a patient with COVID-19 infection, which, during the course of the treatment, developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis. A 60- year-old male patient, a longstanding diabetic, with a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was admitted for treatment. He received parenteral meropenem and oral oseltamivir with parenteral methylprednisolone. Over the course of the admission, he developed signs of orbital cellulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, orbits, and paranasal sinuses, revealed soft tissue swelling in the right preseptal, malar, premaxillary and retrobulbar regions with paranasal sinusitis. A nasal biopsy revealed broad aseptate filamentous fungal hyphae suggestive of mucormycosis, which was confirmed on culture. Extensive use of steroids/monoclonal antibodies/broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to the development/exacerbation of a preexisting fungal disease. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of secondary invasive fungal infections in patients with COVID-19 infection. Copyright © 2020, Mehta et al.	false
0	Review of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on current evidence. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak to be a global public health emergency. Currently, the research on SARS-CoV-2 is in its primary stages. Based on current published evidence, this review systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

0	Peroral endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic: Efficacy of the acrylic box (Endo-Splash Protective (ESP) box) for preventing droplet transmission. Background and Aim: Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn in all clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic because anyone could be carrying SARS-CoV-2. Peroral endoscopy is the procedure potentially generating large volumes of aerosols through stimulation of patient coughing. The present study investigated the efficacy of a specially designed acrylic box (Endo-Splash Protective [ESP] box) for preventing droplet transmission as part of droplet precautions for endoscopists and assistants during routine endoscopy for potential asymptomatic carriers or emergent endoscopy for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods and Results: ESP box was fabricated for use in peroral endoscopy performed with the patient in either a left lateral or prone position. Circular ports were created, one for scope insertion and one for each of the assistant's hands. Simulated droplets were released inside ESP box, and the number of droplets was counted every 100/3 ms for 5 s pre-release and post-release at the positions of the endoscopist and assistant. The experiment was repeated eight times at the endoscopist and assistant positions, and the median numbers of droplets were calculated and compared. No significant differences were observed between the median number of droplets counted for 5 s prerelease and postrelease at either the endoscopist (P = 0.239) or assistant (P = 0.576) positions. We could block the droplets by using ESP box. Conclusion(s): The present findings suggest that use of ESP box during peroral endoscopy may reduce endoscopist and assistant droplet exposure, potentially reducing the risk of droplet transmission to healthcare professionals performing peroral endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"Peripheral Neuropathy as a Complication of SARS-Cov-2. Previous reports have shown various neurological manifestations in about 36.4% of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. However, peripheral neuropathy was only reported once before. A 40-year-old healthy woman presented with two weeks of cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, intermittent fevers, fatigue, and myalgia but no weakness. She tested positive for the SARS-Cov-2. Physical exam showed no neurologic deficit. Two weeks later, respiratory symptoms were improving but she developed sudden leg pain, numbness, and weakness. She described it as a ""pain crisis"". Neurological exam showed bilateral symmetrical, non-ascending lower extremity weakness and normal, symmetric reflexes. She had normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, spinal fluid analysis, serum studies including creatinine kinase and C-reactive protein. She had elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low serum copper (72.9 (ref: 80.0-155.0 ug/dL)) and low vitamin B6 (14.6 (ref: 20.0-125.0 nmol/L)). A diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2-associated peripheral neuropathy was considered. We pursued empiric treatment with intravenous steroids (1000 mg methylprednisolone for three days), followed by a total of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) given over five days. Pain management was done with gabapentin and ketorolac. We replaced copper and vitamin B6. Six weeks later, she reported improvement and was closer to baseline, but she endorsed residual, exertional, mild bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Previous reports of treatment of SARS-Cov-2-associated neuropathy included corticosteroids and IVIG. Our patient saw the most symptomatic improvement with gabapentin. In our case, the preserved reflexes, lack of ascending pattern, sudden onset of symptoms, and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) argued against Guillain-Barre syndrome. Copper deficiency can result in myelopathy but not peripheral neuropathy, so is unlikely the sole explanation. Awareness and early treatment of peripheral neuropathy in SARS-Cov-2 can result in improved clinical outcomes for patients. Copyright © 2020, Bureau et al."	false
0	SARS CoV-2 Surveillance and Exposure in the Perioperative Setting with Universal testing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Policies. BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases in March and April 2020. Since then, universal PCR based surveillance testing and PPE measures are in wide use in procedural settings. There is limited published experience on the utility and sustainability of PCR based surveillance testing in areas with receding and consistently low community COVID-19 rates., METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center in NYC from March 22, 2020, until August 22, 2020. Asymptomatic patients underwent SARS CoV-2 testing before surgeries, interventional radiology procedures, and endoscopy. Contact tracing in procedural areas was done if a patient with an initial negative screen re-tested positive within 48 hours of the procedure., RESULTS: From March 22 until August 22, 2020, 11,540 unique patients underwent 14,233 tests before surgeries or procedures at MSKCC. Overall, 65 patients were positive, with a peak rate of 4.3% that fell below 0.3 % after April 2020. For the 65 positive cases, three were pre-symptomatic, and 38 were asymptomatic. Among asymptomatic test-positive patients, 76 % had PCR cycle threshold (Ct) > 30 at first detection. Five patients tested newly positive in the immediate post-operative period, exposing 82 employees with one case of probable transmission (1.2%)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified on pre-procedural surveillance was low in our study, which was conducted in an area with limited community spread at the later stage of the study Universal PPE is protective in procedural settings. Optimal and flexible diagnostic strategies are needed to accomplish and sustain the goals of comprehensive pre-procedure surveillance testing. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Increased incidence of precocious and accelerated puberty in females during and after the Italian lockdown for the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The timing of puberty in girls is occurring at an increasingly early age. While a positive family history is recognised as a predisposing factor for early or precocious puberty, the role of environmental factors is not fully understood., AIMS OF THE STUDY: To make a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of newly diagnosed central precocious puberty (CPP) and the rate of pubertal progression in previously diagnosed patients during and after the Italian lockdown for COVID-19, comparing data with corresponding data from the previous 5 years. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and the use of electronic devices increased during lockdown in these patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 49 females with CPP. We divided the patients into two groups: group 1, patients presenting a newly diagnosed CPP and group 2, patients with previously diagnosed slow progression CPP whose pubertal progression accelerated during or after lockdown. We collected auxological, clinical, endocrinological and radiological data which were compared with data from two corresponding control groups (patients followed by our Unit, March to July 2015-2019). Patients' families completed a questionnaire to assess differences in the use of electronic devices before and during lockdown., RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients presented newly diagnosed CPP (group 1) and 12, with previously diagnosed but untreated slow progression CPP presented an acceleration in the rate of pubertal progression (group 2). The number of new CPP diagnoses was significantly higher than the mean for the same period of the previous 5 years (p < 0.0005). There were no significant differences between patients in group 1 and control group 1 regarding time between appearance of B2 and CPP diagnosis, although group 1 patients had a significantly earlier chronological age at B2, a more advanced Tanner stage at diagnosis (p < 0.005), higher basal LH and E2 levels, higher LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05) and increased uterine length (p < 0.005) and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). The number of patients with previously diagnosed CPP whose pubertal development accelerated was also statistically higher compared to controls (p < 0.0005). In this group, patients' basal LH (p < 0.05) and E2 levels (p < 0.0005) became more markedly elevated as did the LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05). These patients also showed a significantly accelerated progression rate as measured by the Tanner scale (p < 0.0005), uterine length (p < 0.005), and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). In both group 1 and group 2, BMI increased significantly (p < 0.05) and patients' families reported an increased use of electronic devices (p < 0.0005)., CONCLUSION: Our data show an increased incidence of newly diagnosed CPP and a faster rate of pubertal progression in patients with a previous diagnosis, during and after lockdown compared to previous years. We hypothesize that triggering environmental factors, such as the BMI and the use of electronic devices, were enhanced during lockdown, stressing their possible role in triggering/influencing puberty and its progression. However, more studies are needed to determine which factors were involved and how they interacted.	false
0	Convalescent (Immune) plasma therapy with all aspects: Yesterday, today and COVID-19. At the end of 2019, the pandemic, which originated in China, has become a major concern all over the world. A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been defined as the reason for a cluster of unknown pneumonia. Thus far, no precise therapy or vaccine has been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild cases can be treated by supportive care although symptomatic treatment is not enough for critically ill patients. However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, convalescent (immune) plasma (CIP) and certain specific antiviral drugs for this disease are still being investigated for improving the survival rate of cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection whose condition continued to deteriorate. The use of passive immunization, for the prophylaxis and therapy of human contagious diseases, has been gone back to the 20th century. Human whole blood is also a source of antibodies. CIP consists of collecting blood plasma from someone who has recovered from a specific infection. Recent literature data show that human CIP may be an alternative option for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and will be accessible when adequate numbers of individuals have improved. However, such donors should have a high titer of neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma. CIP can be administered to improve the survival rate for COVID-19, together with other drugs and preventive measures, when specific management is not obtainable. On the other hand, randomized clinical trials are still necessary to assess the safety and efficiency of CIP in the therapy of COVID-19. In this article, we want to address the special role of CIP therapy in various infectious diseases from yesterday to today, including COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine.	false
0	Health care seeking due to COVID-19 related symptoms and health care cancellations among older Brazilian adults: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The continent of the Americas has the greatest number of people infected and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the world. Brazil occupies the 2nd position in numbers of infected cases and deaths, preceded only by the United States. Older adults and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has serious consequences for health services. Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on health care use in Brazil among older adults. Results highlight the need to adapt health care delivery (such as through telemedicine) to ensure the continuity of care as well as the urgent need for wide dissemination of information to guide the population on disease prevention measures and how to obtain healthcare when needed.	false
0	COVID-19: Post-lockdown guidelines. To summarize, first, there is no unanimity within the medical community for continuing the severe restrictions on activities of the vast majority of the total population that are mainly applicable to the most vulnerable, very small minority of the total population. Second, repurposed (mainly) antiviral treatments can only be expected to have very limited results in controlling SARS-C oV-2 viral load of the most severely impacted, based on trials conducted so far. Third, it is difficult to see how safe COVID- 19 vaccines can be developed and fully tested on time scales of one or two years, as proposed presently. Fourth, the only real protection against a future COVID- 19 pandemic or any other viral pandemic is the one that was demonstrated to work in the SARS, MERS, COVID- 19 and annual influenza pandemics: a healthy immune system capable of neutralizing incoming viruses as nature intended. We need an Operation Warp Speed (currently working to produce a vaccine in a record short time period in the USA) to identify and eliminate those factors that weaken the immune system as thoroughly, comprehensively, and rapidly as possible.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

0	COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on sexual life: Recommendations from the Italian society of andrology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Summary coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus that causes an infectious disease, called COVID-19, first detected in patients with pneumonia in Wuhan (People's Republic of China) on December 2019. Italy was the first European country to state the outbreak of the infection and its Council of Ministers declared the state of health emergency on 31.01.2020, then the World Health Organization ruled a global pandemic on 11.03.2020. The nasopharyngeal swab is based on the detection of virus RNA and is the only reliable one for declaring COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients before hospitalization may be fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, asthenia, myalgia and/or arthralgia. This symptomatology can be often complicated in a dramatically increasing manner such as to require hospitalization starting from the third-fourth week. COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically affected the quality of life by changing inter-personal relationships, community life and obviously sexual health. The purpose of this work, based on available evidence, is to provide recommendations to help the population to face their sexual life in this critical period.Copyright © 2020 Edizioni Scripta Manent s.n.c..

0	Empathy and use of evidence in handling travellers coming from covid-19 high-risk countries. Most African countries have implemented the recommendation to quarantine travellers coming from COVID-19 high-risk countries. This is a noble public health intervention which has been shown to reduce new infections and mortality. There have been reports of hostility towards travellers returning from COVID-19 high-risk countries regarding quarantine especially in developing countries. Some have been housed in squalid conditions or asked to pay for their own accommodation in private facilities. Moreover, quarantine has been associated with mental and psychological consequences. With the developments in the rapid antibody diagnostic tests, a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis and progression of COVID-19 there might be a need to implement screening algorithms so that only travellers that pose a danger to the community are quarantined.Copyright © Richard Makurumidze et al.	false
0	"Emerging details about covid-19 and chronology of the pandemic in turkey. Coronaviruses are found in all mammalian and avian species. Due to its mild infection on upper respiratory tract, this virus was not considered as a serious human pathogen until the outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Recently the third and the biggest outbreak of coronavirus ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" has erupted and the world is now in a struggle to combat this disease. Although everything has not yet been fully clarified about this new type of virus, the data obtained from the studies conducted so far provides guidance on how to deal with SARS-CoV-2. In this context, this review provides information about pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, presence in animals, potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the detection methods used in the world and Turkey.Copyright © 2020, Chartered Inst. of Building Services Engineers.

0	Emergency Healthcare Providers' Perceptions of Preparedness and Willingness to Work during Disasters and Public Health Emergencies. This study evaluates the perceptions of preparedness and willingness to work during disasters and public health emergencies among 213 healthcare workers at hospitals in the southern region of Saudi Arabia by using a quantitative survey (Fight or Flight). The results showed that participants' willingness to work unconditionally during disasters and emergencies varied based on the type of condition: natural disasters (61.97%), seasonal influenza pandemic (52.58%), smallpox pandemic (47.89%), SARS/COVID-19 pandemic (43.56%), special flu pandemic (36.15%), mass shooting (37.56%), chemical incident and bombing threats (31.92%), biological events (28.17%), Ebola outbreaks (27.7%), and nuclear incident (24.88%). A lack of confidence and the absence of safety assurance for healthcare workers and their family members were the most important reasons cited. The co-variation between age and education versus risk and danger by Spearman's rho confirmed a small negative correlation between education and danger at a 95% level of significance, meaning that educated healthcare workers have less fear to work under dangerous events. Although the causes of unsuccessful management of disasters and emergencies may vary, individuals' characteristics, such as lack of confidence and emotional distractions because of uncertainty about the safety issues, may also play a significant role. Besides educational initiatives, other measures, which guarantee the safety of healthcare providers and their family members, should be established and implemented.	false
0	Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. Background: The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5 x 1010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606. Finding(s): Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0.05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493-1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96-317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360-792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R2=0.67 by Marburg VN; p<0.001). Interpretation(s): ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

0	Coinfection and other clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen that mainly spreads by droplets. Most published studies have been focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients are limited. In this study, we aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome, and follow-up results. RESULT(S): A total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 case patients whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65 of 68; 95.59%) were household contacts of adults. Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness. Abnormalities in leukocyte count were found in 23 (31.08%) children, and 10 (13.51%) children presented with abnormal lymphocyte count. Of the 34 (45.95%) patients who had nucleic acid testing results for common respiratory pathogens, 19 (51.35%) showed coinfection with other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Ten (13.51%) children had real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for fecal specimens, and 8 of them showed prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSION(S): Pediatric patients with COVID-19 presented with distinct epidemiological, clinical, and radiologic characteristics from adult patients. Nearly one-half of the infected children had coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens. It is not uncommon for pediatric patients to have prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the convalescent phase.Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics	false
0	Cardiac damage in patients with the severe type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Studies showed COVID-19 affected not only the lung but also other organs. In this study, we aimed to explore the cardiac damage in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We collected data of 100 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to April 10, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, and treatment. In-hospital mortality were observed. Cardiac damage was defined as plasma hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) over 34.2 pg/ml and/or N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) above 450 pg/ml at the age < 50, above 900 pg/ml at the age < 75, or above 1800 pg/ml at the age >= 75., RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old. 69 (69.0%) had comorbidities, mainly presenting hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fever (69 [69.0%]), cough (63 [63.0%]), chest distress (13 [13.0%]), and fatigue (12 [12.0%]) were the common initial symptoms. Cardiac damage occurred in 25 patients. In the subgroups, hsTnI was significantly higher in elder patients (>= 60 years) than in the young (median [IQR], 5.2 [2.2-12.8] vs. 1.9 [1.9-6.2], p = 0.018) and was higher in men than in women (4.2 [1.9-12.8] vs. 2.9 [1.9-7.4], p = 0.018). The prevalence of increased NTproBNP was significantly higher in men than in women (32.1% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.006), but was similar between the elder and young patients (20.0% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.554). After multivariable analysis, male and hypertension were the risk factors of cardiac damage. The mortality was 4.0%., CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac damage exists in patients with the severe type of COVID-19, especially in male patients with hypertension. Clinicians should pay more attention to cardiac damage.	false
0	Liver transplantation in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: national and center-level responses. COVID-19 has profoundly affected the American health care system; its effect on the liver transplant (LT) waitlist based on COVID-19 incidence has not been characterized. Using SRTR data, we compared observed LT waitlist registrations, waitlist mortality, deceased donor LTs (DDLT), and living donor LTs (LDLT) 3/15/2020-8/31/2020 to expected values based on historical trends 1/2016-1/2020, stratified by statewide COVID-19 incidence. Overall, from 3/15-4/30 new listings were 11% fewer than expected (IRR=0.84 0.89 0.93 ), LDLTs were 49% fewer (IRR=0.37 0.51 0.72 ), and DDLTs were 9% fewer (IRR=0.85 0.91 0.97 ). In May, new listings were 21% fewer (IRR=0.74 0.79 0.84 ), LDLTs were 42% fewer (IRR=0.39 0.58 0.85 ) and DDLTs were 13% more (IRR=1.07 1.15 1.23 ). Centers in states with the highest incidence 3/15-4/30 had 59% more waitlist deaths (IRR=1.09 1.59 2.32 ) and 34% fewer DDLTs (IRR=0.50 0.66 0.86 ). By August, waitlist outcomes were occurring at expected rates, except for DDLT (13% more across all incidences). While the early COVID-affected states endured major transplant practice changes, later in the pandemic the newly COVID-affected areas were not impacted to the same extent. These results speak to the adaptability of the transplant community in addressing the pandemic and applying new knowledge to patient care. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in critically ill patients: A hypercoagulable state demonstrated by parameters of haemostasis and clot waveform analysis. Patients with COVID-19 are known to be at risk of developing both venous, arterial and microvascular thrombosis, due to an excessive immuno-thrombogenic response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overlapping syndromes of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy with consumptive coagulopathy and microangiopathy can be seen in critically ill patients as well. Blood was collected from 12 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 who were on either mechanical ventilation or on high flow oxygen with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300 mmHg. Laboratory tests were performed for parameters of haemostasis, clot waveform analysis and anti-phospholipid antibodies. CWA parameters were raised with elevated aPTT median Min1 (clot velocity) 9.3%/s (IQR 7.1-9.9%/s), elevated PT median Min1 10.3%/s (IQR 7.1-11.1%/s), elevated aPTT median Min2 (clot acceleration) 1.5%/s2 (IQR 1.0-1.6%/s2), elevated PT median Min2 5.2%/s2 (3.6-5.7%/s2), elevated aPTT median Max2 (clot deceleration) 1.3%/s2 (IQR 0.8-1.4%/s2) elevated PT median Max2 3.8%/s2 (IQR 2.6-4.2%/s2), increased aPTT median Delta change (decreased light transmission due to increased clot formation) 87.8% (IQR 70.2-91.8%) and PT median Delta change 33.0%. This together with raised median Factor VIII levels of 262.5%, hyperfibrinogenemia (median fibrinogen levels 7.5 g/L), increased median von Willebrand factor antigen levels 320% and elevated median D-dimer levels 1.7 mug/dl support the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. A lupus anticoagulant was present in 50% of patients. Our laboratory findings further support the view that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a state of hypercoagulability.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false

0	"Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases?. Background: COVID-19, a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly presents as fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue. Although the majority of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, some are more prone to serious outcomes, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with intense cytokine release (also known as a ""cytokine storm""). Similar to COVID-19, HLH is characterized by aggressive course leading to multi-organ failure. Main text: The purpose of this review article is to draw attention to the possibility of the complication of HLH in patients with the severe course of COVID-19. Indeed, some of the clinical characteristics observed in the more severe cases of COVID-19 are reminiscent of secondary HLH (which can be triggered by infections, malignancies, rheumatological diseases, or autoimmune/immunodeficiency conditions). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection also suggests that HLH or a similar hyperinflammatory syndrome is the cause of the severe course of the infection. Conclusion(s): The pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 indicate that an increased inflammatory response corresponding to HLH is occurring. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using standard laboratory tests to identify those for whom immunosuppressive therapy may improve outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."	false
0	Clinical Implications of Myocardial Involvement with Covid 19: A Case Control Study. Background: As the number of deaths exceeds 100,000, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become the third leading cause of death in the United States. In severe cases, the virus acts through a surge of immune modulators causing multi-organ damage and failure. The hypothesis that new onset HFrEF contributing to higher mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19 has yet to be tested. Method(s): We extracted transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports of all COVID-19 patients (confirmed by serology) from 4 hospitals within the Steward Healthcare System done between 3/22-4/24 of patients with no known heart failure who developed signs and symptoms of clinical heart failure that prompted imaging with TTE and found to have HFrEF (EF <=40%). Age and gender matched patients with COVID19 with normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities formed the control arm. Result(s): We identified 171 patients with TTE done between 3/22-4/24. Of these, 30 patients developed new onset heart failure during their hospitalization with an EF <= 40%. Two thirds of the patients with HFrEF (66.7%) required hospitalization more than 7 days versus 33.3% in patients with normal EF. More than half of the heart failure patient cohort (53%) required ICU level of care compared to 40% in patients with normal EF. During their stay in the ICU, 58% of the patients with EF < 40 % required intubation and mechanical ventilation as opposed to 37% in patients with normal EF, and 53% required vasopressor support to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) > 65, compared to 43% in the group with EF > 60%. In-hospital mortality was 63% in the HFrEF group and 43% in patients with normal EF. Conclusion(s): Patients with COVID-19 who developed HFrEF during hospitalization had worse outcomes and a higher mortality when compared to COVID-19 patients with normal EF.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical features and laboratory diagnosis tool for emerging corona virus (COVID-19): A review. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pneumonia disease with a severe outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which is caused by coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) with severe acute respiratory syndrome. There have been tremendous advances in in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial diagnostic of COVID-19 is based on the test of Sputum, Blood and SWAB of throat and nose. The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours but shortened to minimum of 45 hr. Another method of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min and has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA). A range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulin produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection i.e, immunoglobulin (IgM) and immunoglobulin (IgG). In this review, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss various diagnostic method of COVID-19, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for eradiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © Journal of Global Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences	false
0	Characteristics Associated With Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes in an Academic Health Care System. Importance: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. Objective(s): To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. Exposure: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription-PCR tests performed in external labs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). Result(s): Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P=.009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P=.02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P=.02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P<.001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P=.04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P<.001; P for interaction=.02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P=.005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P=.53; P for interaction=.04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P=.001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P=.88; P for interaction=.02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P<.001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P=.59; P for interaction=.046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in high-population density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. Associations of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race.	false
0	Autopsy Findings and Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 210 000 deaths worldwide. However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features. OBJECTIVE(S): To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS: The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. RESULT(S): Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (n = 10) or outpatient sector (n = 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart. LIMITATION: Limited sample size. CONCLUSION(S): The high incidence of thromboembolic events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.

0	Association Between Social Vulnerability and a County's Risk for Becoming a COVID-19 Hotspot - United States, June 1-July 25, 2020. Poverty, crowded housing, and other community attributes associated with social vulnerability increase a community's risk for adverse health outcomes during and following a public health event (1). CDC uses standard criteria to identify U.S. counties with rapidly increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspot counties) to support health departments in coordinating public health responses (2). County-level data on COVID-19 cases during June 1-July 25, 2020 and from the 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) were analyzed to examine associations between social vulnerability and hotspot detection and to describe incidence after hotspot detection. Areas with greater social vulnerabilities, particularly those related to higher representation of racial and ethnic minority residents (risk ratio [RR] = 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-6.4), density of housing units per structure (RR = 3.1; 95% CI = 2.7-3.6), and crowded housing units (i.e., more persons than rooms) (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.8-2.3), were more likely to become hotspots, especially in less urban areas. Among hotspot counties, those with greater social vulnerability had higher COVID-19 incidence during the 14 days after detection (212-234 cases per 100,000 persons for highest SVI quartile versus 35-131 cases per 100,000 persons for other quartiles). Focused public health action at the federal, state, and local levels is needed not only to prevent communities with greater social vulnerability from becoming hotspots but also to decrease persistently high incidence among hotspot counties that are socially vulnerable.	false
0	Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States. Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective(s): To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Result(s): At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.Copyright © 2020 Paltiel AD et al.

0	[Retrospective study on a CoViD-19 outbreak that developed in February during a dinner in the municipality of Capannori (Lucca).]. The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In January the disease spread rapidly to other regions and beyond Chinese borders until it reached Italy where, on February 21, the first case of non-imported contagion was found. On the same date, as the commercial activities were still regularly open, the dinner, which saw as protagonists the participants of this retrospective study, took place. Of the 49 people attending the event, 47 joined the study. The participants of this study were all males, with an average age of 57 years old, all asymptomatic during the dinner. The participants voluntarily underwent serological or swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 and answered questions from our telephone interview. From the data obtained it emerges that 26 people (55.3%), after the dinner, developed one or more symptoms. The most frequently encountered symptom was fever, present in 76.9% of the symptomatic. 26 people were positive on the diagnostic tests (55.3% of the total examined), 24 of them were symptomatic. The conceivable R0 (the basic reproduction number) is higher than the one present in the literature (7.7 vs 3.8), this is probably due to the conditions in which the dinner took place (not ventilated environment, absence of safety distances, absence of personal protective equipment).	false
0	Our Experience with Using WatchPat (Itamar Medical, Ltd.), Home Sleep Testing (HST) for the Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea in Advanced Heart Failure Patients. Introduction: Sleep apnea is widely reported as an independent predictor for the development of heart failure (HF), with a 2.6-fold increase in incidence after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and smoking. The accepted gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis is polysomnography (PSG); however, access to PSG is limited and more so in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. WatchPAT Home Sleep Testing (WPHST) has been validated to accurately detect both obstructive (OSA) as well as central sleep apnea (CSA) in the general population. However, to date no studies have reported its use in the advanced HF population. Method(s): This was a single center, retrospective, observational analysis, beginning December of 2019-April 2020. All subjects that screened positive on the STOP-BANG sleep apnea questionnaire and assigned the HST were analyzed. Result(s): 62 subjects (HF, LVAD, Orthotopic Heart Transplant [OHT]) were assigned HST. 93% (n=58) completed testing. 77% (n=7/9) of patients with LVAD had testing that was deemed inconclusive, thus patients with LVAD were censored from our analysis. Of the 44 patients that tested positive for at least mild OSA, 32 % (n=14) of the patients were post OHT. Over 45% of both OHT and HF patients tested, were documented to have severe sleep apnea (See table1). Discussion(s): WatchPat is the only HST that proports calculations of total sleep time. It appears to be a viable option for advanced HF and OHT patients with limited access to in-lab PSG. However, WPHST was unable to provide conclusive data for LVAD patients, hypothesized due to lack of native pulsatility. Strikingly, severe sleep apnea was documented in >45% of all patients, and no significant differences when comparing OHT patients to the advanced heart failure population. Continued research and emphasis on testing and treatment of HF patients being considered for advanced therapies is warranted, especially with the current proclivity towards minimum contact post Covid19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	New Strategy against COVID-19: L-Serine Doped QDs for Fast Detection of COVID-19 and Blocking of S-Protein. To detect COVID-19, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is usually used but there is a number of faulty tests or an inexact diagnostic, especially in the primordial period of infection. In this regard, the optical response of hybrid quantum dots (QDs): L-serine is presented for the first time as a new and rapid method of detection. QDs were further conjugated with anti-infectious viruses' antibodies. The detection of a target analyte is increased due to the fact that the final formed hybrid system is exposed to doses of L-serine optically active. QDs acts as L-Serine's host. This last will trap the virus and emerges less/high photoluminescence (PL) response depending on the L-serine, virus, and doping concentrations. Such rapid optical treatment will inform us of the infection state faster and more efficiently than ELISA tests. The fluorescence properties of the new hybrid system permit a control of coronavirus with a limit of detection LOD similar to 80 EID/50 mu l thanks to families of clusters induced by L-serine's molecules. Families of L-serine clusters with inhomogeneous densities can block the S-protein in COVID-19. Moreover, the detection can be issued by trapping the virus with the same dopant.	false
0	Effect of Ergothioneine on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Endothelial Injury. Ergothioneine (ET) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that is synthesized by non-yeast fungi and certain bacteria. ET is not synthesized by animals, including humans, but is avidly taken up from the diet, especially from mushrooms. In the current study, we elucidated the effect of ET on the hCMEC/D3 human brain endothelial cell line. Endothelial cells are exposed to high levels of the cholesterol oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and this process is thought to mediate pathological inflammation. 7KC induces a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and an increase in apoptosis and necrosis in the endothelial cells. A relocalization of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, towards the nucleus of the cells was also observed. These effects were significantly attenuated by ET. In addition, 7KC induces marked increases in the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), as well as COX2 enzymatic activity, and these were significantly reduced by ET. Moreover, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ET were significantly reduced by co-incubation with an inhibitor of the ET transporter, OCTN1 (VHCL). This shows that ET needs to enter the endothelial cells to have a protective effect and is unlikely to act via extracellular neutralizing of 7KC. The protective effect on inflammation in brain endothelial cells suggests that ET might be useful as a nutraceutical for the prevention or management of neurovascular diseases, such as stroke and vascular dementia. Moreover, the ability of ET to cross the blood-brain barrier could point to its usefulness in combatting 7KC that is produced in the CNS during neuroinflammation, e.g. after excitotoxicity, in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and possibly COVID-19-related neurologic complications.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	How should diagnostic kits development adapt quickly in COVID 19-like pandemic models? Pros and cons of sensory platforms used in COVID-19 sensing. As COVID-19 has reached pandemic status and the number of cases continues to grow, widespread availability of diagnostic testing is critical in helping identify and control the emergence of this rapidly spreading and serious illness. However, a lacking in making a quick reaction to the threat and starting early development of diagnostic sensing tools has had an important impact globally. In this regard, here we will review critically the current developed diagnostic tools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the different types through the discussion of their pros and cons such as nucleic acid detection tests (including PCR and CRISPR), antibody and protein-based diagnosis tests. In addition, potential technologies that are under development such as on-site diagnosis platforms, lateral flow, and portable PCR units are discussed. Data collection and epidemiological analysis could also be an interesting factor to incorporate with the emerging technologies especially with the wide access to smartphones. Lastly, a SWOT analysis and perspectives on how the development of novel sensory platforms should be treated by the different decision-makers are analyzed. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Frequency of coronavirus NL63 infection in children with upper respiratory infection by real-time PCR. Background: Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a new respiratory virus associated with acute respiratory infection in children. Infection with this virus is usually accompanied by upper and lower infections of the respiratory tract in adults. Objective(s): In a retrospective study, we investigated the incidence of coronavirus infection in children under the age of five years. Method(s): We collected 138 specimens (nasal and throat swabs) from children less than five-years-old with acute respiratory infection from October 2018 to December 2019. Then, HCoV-NL63 was investigated using real-time PCR. Result(s): Out of 138 samples, 33 (23.9%) were positive for coronavirus NL63, including 21 (63.6%) male samples and 12 (36.4%) female samples. There was no significant correlation between gender and positivity for coronavirus infection (P > 0.05). However, the association of clinical symptoms with the virus was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This study was conducted for the first time in Kerman Province. In this study, the frequency of coronavirus NL63 was evaluated among children with acute respiratory infection with a highly sensitive method, real-time PCR. The prevalence of this virus was 33%, which was more frequent than in similar studies.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).	false
0	Development and evaluation of a serological test for diagnosis of COVID-19 with selected recombinant spike proteins. Serological test is a valuable diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed GICA for detection of total antibodies could be a powerful complement to the current RNA tests for COVID-19.	false
0	Delirium and encephalopathy in severe COVID-19: A cohort analysis of ICU patients. Background: Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. We aimed at describing delirium and neurological symptoms of COVID-19 in ICU patients. Method(s): We conducted a bicentric cohort study in two French ICUs of Strasbourg University Hospital. All the 150 patients referred for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 between March 3 and May 5, 2020, were included at their admission. Ten patients (6.7%) were excluded because they remained under neuromuscular blockers during their entire ICU stay. Neurological examination, including CAM-ICU, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in some of the patients with delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The primary endpoint was to describe the incidence of delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The secondary endpoints were to describe the characteristics of delirium, to compare the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in patients with and without delirium and/or abnormal neurological symptoms. Result(s): The 140 patients were aged in median of 62 [IQR 52; 70] years old, with a median SAPSII of 49 [IQR 37; 64] points. Neurological examination was normal in 22 patients (15.7%). One hundred eighteen patients (84.3%) developed a delirium with a combination of acute attention, awareness, and cognition disturbances. Eighty-eight patients (69.3%) presented an unexpected state of agitation despite high infusion rates of sedative treatments and neuroleptics, and 89 (63.6%) patients had corticospinal tract signs. Brain MRI performed in 28 patients demonstrated enhancement of subarachnoid spaces in 17/28 patients (60.7%), intraparenchymal, predominantly white matter abnormalities in 8 patients, and perfusion abnormalities in 17/26 patients (65.4%). The 42 electroencephalograms mostly revealed unspecific abnormalities or diffuse, especially bifrontal, slow activity. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed inflammatory disturbances in 18/28 patients, including oligoclonal bands with mirror pattern and elevated IL-6. The CSF RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one patient. The delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were responsible for longer mechanical ventilation compared to the patients without delirium/neurological symptoms. Delirium/neurological symptoms could be secondary to systemic inflammatory reaction to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and relevance: Delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients are a major issue in ICUs, especially in the context of insufficient human and material resources.

0	Deconstructing syndemics: The many layers of clustering multi-comorbidities in people living with HIV. The HIV epidemic has dramatically changed over the past 30 years; there are now fewer newly infected people (especially children), fewer AIDS-related deaths, and more people with HIV (PWH) receiving treatment. However, the HIV epidemic is far from over. Despite the tremendous advances in anti-retroviral therapies (ART) and the implementation of ART regimens, HIV incidence (number of new infections over a defined period of time) and prevalence (the burden of HIV infection) in certain regions of the world and socio-economic groups are still on the rise. HIV continues to disproportionally affect highly marginalized populations that constitute higher-risk and stigmatized groups, underserved and/or neglected populations. In addition, it is not uncommon for PWH to suffer enhanced debilitating conditions resulting from the synergistic interactions of both communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While research utilizing only a comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the biological settings of the co-occurring conditions from a molecular and mechanistic view, harmful interactions between comorbidities are often overlooked, particularly under adverse socio-economical and behavioral circumstances, likely prompting disease clustering in PWH. Synergistic epidemics (syndemics) research aims to capture these understudied interactions: the mainly non-biological aspects that are central to interpret disease clustering in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities only framework. Connecting population-level clustering of social and health problems through syndemic interventions has proved to be a critical knowledge gap that will need to be addressed in order to improve prevention and care strategies and bring us a step closer to ending the HIV epidemic.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	The role of Interleukin-4 in COVID-19 associated male infertility - A hypothesis. COVID-19 is a present-day complex pandemic infection with unpredictable levels of morbidity and mortality in various global populations. COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-alpha and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients. So, in this hypothesis, we focused on the role of IL-4 in COVID-19 patients associated with male infertility via Th2 cells and JAK-STAT signaling.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	The duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in patients recovering from COVID-19. The knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) shedding is highly relevant to the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Deep nasopharyngeal swabs repeatedly collected from a cohort of one hundred patients with COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). The median period of viral genome detectability was 15 days. Furthermore, the authors tested the hypothesis on the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the period in which the viral genome is detectable. They did not find any statistically significant difference in the duration of viral clearance between patients with asymptomatic to mild disease or severe disease.	false
0	Elucidating the Pivotal Immunomodulatory and Anti-Inflammatory Potentials of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are derivatives of 4-aminoquinoline compounds with over 60 years of safe clinical usage. CQ and HCQ are able to inhibit the production of cytokines such as interleukin-(IL-) 1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-22. Also, CQ and HCQ inhibit the production of interferon-(IFN-) and IFN-gamma and/or tumor necrotizing factor-(TNF-) . Furthermore, CQ blocks the production of prostaglandins (PGs) in the intact cell by inhibiting substrate accessibility of arachidonic acid necessary for the production of PGs. Moreover, CQ affects the stability between T-helper cell (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokine secretion by augmenting IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, CQ is capable of blocking lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) triggered stimulation of extracellular signal-modulated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in human PBMCs. HCQ at clinical levels effectively blocks CpG-triggered class-switched memory B-cells from differentiating into plasmablasts as well as producing IgG. Also, HCQ inhibits cytokine generation from all the B-cell subsets. IgM memory B-cells exhibits the utmost cytokine production. Nevertheless, CQ triggers the production of reactive oxygen species. A rare, but serious, side effect of CQ or HCQ in nondiabetic patients is hypoglycaemia. Thus, in critically ill patients, CQ and HCQ are most likely to deplete all the energy stores of the body leaving the patient very weak and sicker. We advocate that, during clinical usage of CQ and HCQ in critically ill patients, it is very essential to strengthen the CQ or HCQ with glucose infusion. CQ and HCQ are thus potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Copyright © 2020 Seidu A. Richard et al.	false
0	COVID-19 in a Patient Treated for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Persistent Viral Shedding with No Cytokine Storm. Introduction: The coronavirus disease COVID-19 is considered a pandemic disease that has developed rapidly all over the world. As of today, it is unclear whether immunosuppression confers an increased risk for pulmonary complications, or conversely, whether it can be a protective factor with respect to a cytokine storm., Case description: We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with rituximab who was infected with COVID-19 pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case has been reported in the literature with similar characteristics. The patient had a non-classic evolution of clinical symptoms with persistent fever and viral shedding, in addition to a negative serology., Conclusion: This case emphasizes the management and immunity response to COVID-19 pneumonia in such patients. Data are still needed regarding patients who have prolonged B-cell depletion, which may put the patient at a higher risk for reinfection., LEARNING POINTS: Demonstration of the immunity response to COVID-19 pneumonia in an immunosuppressed patient.To highlight the management and evolution of such rare cases during this pandemic.

0	The Clinical Manifestations and Interval Changes of Reverse-Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reactions among Different Specimens of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients. BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a number of cases and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been reported worldwide. In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention., METHODS: The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads., RESULTS: From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.	false
0	Muscle strength and physical performance in patients without previous disabilities recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated skeletal muscle strength and physical performance (1min- STS and SPPB tests), dyspnea, fatigue and Single Breath Counting at discharge from a post-acute Covid Department, in patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia who had no locomotor disability prior to the infection.Quadriceps and biceps were weak in 86% and 73% of patients, respectively. Maximal Voluntary Contraction for quadriceps was 18.9 (6.8) Kg and for biceps 15.0 (5.5) Kg, i.e. 57 and 69% of the predicted normal value (%pred). The number of chair rises in the 1min-STS was 22.1 (7.3) (63% pred), while the SPPB score was 7.9 (3.3) (68% pred). At the end of the 1min-STS test, 24% of patients showed exercise-induced desaturation. The SBC count was 35.4 (12.3), i.e. 71.8% that of healthy controls. Mild-to-moderate dyspnea and fatigue were found after ADL [Borg score 0.5 (0-2) and 1 (0-2)] and after the 1min-STS [Borg score 3 (2-5) and 1 (0-3)]. Significant correlations were observed between muscle strength and physical performance indices (R from 0.31 to 0.69). The high prevalence of impairment in skeletal muscle strength and physical performance in hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia without prior locomotor disabilities suggests the need for rehabilitation programs after discharge.	false
0	Incidence of acute coronary syndrome during national lock-down: insights from nationwide data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: Urgent recognition and treatment are needed in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), however this may be difficult during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with a national lock-down. We aimed to examine the incidence of ACS after national lock-down., METHODS: The Danish government announced national lock-down on March 11 2020 and first phase of reopening was announced on April 6. Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified first-time ACS admissions in A) January 1 - May 7 2017-2019, and B) January 1 - May 6 2020. Incidence rates of ACS admissions per week for the 2017-2019-period and the 2020-period were computed and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed using Poisson regression analysis., RESULTS: The number of ACS admissions were 8,204 (34.6% female, median age 68.3 years) and 2,577 (34.0% female, median age 68.5 years) for the 2017-2019- and 2020-period, respectively. No significant differences in IRRs were identified for weeks 1-9 (January 1 - March 4) for 2020 compared with week 1-9 for 2017-2019. In 2020, significant lower IRRs were identified for week 10 (March 5-11) IRR=0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.87), week 11 (12-18 March) IRR=0.68 (0.56-0.84), and week 14 (2 - 8 April) IRR=0.79 (0.65-0.97). No significant differences in IRRs were identified for week 15-18 (April 9 - May 6). In subgroup analysis, we identified that the main result was driven by male patients, and patients >=60 years., CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic with an established national lock-down we identified a significant decline around 30% in the incidence of ACS admissions. Along with the reopening of society, ACS admissions were stabilized at levels equal to previous years. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 on patients with rheumatic complications of cancer immunotherapy: results of a registry survey. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) block negative regulatory molecules, such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1, in order to mount an antitumor response. T cells are important for antiviral defense, but it is not known whether patients with cancer treated with ICI are more or less vulnerable to viral infections such as COVID-19. Furthermore, immunosuppressive treatment of immune-related adverse events (irAE) may also impact infection risk. Rheumatic irAEs are often persistent, and can require long-term treatment with immunosuppressive agents. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection and assess changes in ICI and immunosuppressive medication use among patients enrolled in a prospective rheumatic irAE registry during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 16 2020, following the 'surge' of COVID-19 infections in the New York Tri-State area, we sent a 23-question survey to 88 living patients enrolled in a single institutional registry of patients with rheumatic irAE. Questions addressed current cancer and rheumatic irAE status, ICI and immunosuppressant medication use, history of COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosed infection. A follow-up survey was sent out 6 weeks later. Sixty-five (74%) patients completed the survey. Mean age was 63 years, 59% were female, 70% had received anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy and 80% had had an irAE affecting their joints. Six patients (10%) had definite or probable COVID-19, but all recovered uneventfully, including two still on ICI and on low-to-moderate dose prednisone. Of the 25 on ICI within the last 6 months, seven (28%) had their ICI held due to the pandemic. In patients on immunosuppression for irAE, none had changes made to those medications as a result of the pandemic. The incidence of COVID-19 was no higher in patients still on ICI. Ten percent of rheumatic irAE patients developed COVID-19 during the NY Tri-state 'surge' of March-April 2020. Oncologists held ICI in a quarter of the patients still on them, particularly women, those on anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy, and those who had had a good cancer response. The incidence of COVID-19 was no higher on patients still on ICI. None of the patients on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biological immunosuppressive medications developed COVID-19.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Background: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurs very infrequently; however, with the significantly greater comorbidity burden and acuity of patients with diabetes undergoing coronary angiography/angioplasty (CA), the inherent risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis may be significantly increased. Additionally, significant variations in contemporary practice pattern around peri-CA metformin use still continue to exist. Methods and Results: This is a pilot, single-center, open-labelled, randomized comparison of metformin continuation or 48-hour interruption following CA (Saskatoon, Clinical Trials.gov 03980990). All patients had metformin continued to the time of the angiogram. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, history of chronic liver disease, severe chronic kidney disease (eGFR<30 or on dialysis) or requiring coronary artery bypass graft surgery following CA were ineligible for inclusion. Planned enrollment of 500 patients had been anticipated for the calendar year (June 2019-June 2020), and stratified at randomization by in/out-patient status. The primary outcome included lactic acidosis (lactate >=5mmol/L +/- bicarbonate <18mmol/l) at 48-72 hours after CA. Key secondary outcomes included: absolute lactate levels, acute kidney injury (AKI, >=25% or 27mumol/L rise at 48-72 hours) and all-cause mortality at 1-week. Continuous variables are expressed as medians (25th, 75th percentile) and categorical variables as frequency (%). At study interruption (March 12/20, COVID-19) 312 patients had been randomized, of whom 52% presented with an acute coronary syndrome (n= 161/312; STEMI 11%). Baseline characteristics were balanced across the two groups, including the proportion treated with PCI (Table 1). Follow up lactate levels were available in: continued arm 71% (n=112/157), interrupt arm 67% (n=104/155). No patients in either arm had serum lactate >=5mmol/L, however, metformin continuation compared with a 48-hour interruption had significantly higher median lactate levels (1.70 [1.15, 2.2] vs. 1.40 [1.2, 1.8], p=0.02); no between-group differences were evident for serum bicarbonate (26.0 [24, 28] mmol/L vs. 25.0 [24, 27] mmol/l, p=0.15). No differences were evident in the rates of AKI (7.7% vs. 8.3% p= 1.0). No patients died in either treatment arm at 1-week (vital status available for all 312 patients). Conclusion(s): Conclusion(s): In this interim analysis of contemporary treated patients with diabetes, all of whom had metformin continued up to CA, metformin continuation compared with a 48-hour interruption was not associated with clinically relevant lactic acidosis. Continued metformin use however appears to associate with higher 48-72-hour lactate levels, without differences in AKI or all-cause mortality at 1-week. Trial completion is anticipated with COVID-19 pandemic resolution. [Formula presented] Royal University Hospital FoundationCopyright © 2020	false
0	Admission Hyperglycemia in Non-diabetics Predicts Mortality and Disease Severity in COVID-19: a Pooled Analysis and Meta-summary of Literature. In the latter part of 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China. In less than a year, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 27 million people and claimed more than 800,000 deaths worldwide. Diabetes is a highly prevalent chronic metabolic disease, and recent reports have suggested a possible existence of COVID-19 related new-onset diabetes. Hyperglycemia induces an inflammatory state in the body, which coupled with coronavirus associated immune response is a possible explanation for clinical worsening of patients. We present a summary and pooled analysis of available evidence to ascertain the relationship between hyperglycemia in undiagnosed diabetics and outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Our results showed that hyperglycemia in non-diabetics was associated with higher risk of severe/critical illness (OR 1.837 (95% CI 1.368-2.465, P < 0.001) and mortality (2.822, 95% CI 1.587-5.019, P < 0.001) compared with those with normal values of blood glucose. The management of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 poses significant challenges in clinical practice, and the need to develop strategies for optimal glucose control in these patients cannot be overlooked.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID-19: estimation based on a virtual case. BACKGROUND: Recently, low dose radiotherapy delivered to the whole lung has been proposed as treatment for the pneumonia due to COVID-19. Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease., METHODS: Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy-1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable., RESULTS: The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose <=0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID., CONCLUSIONS: A RT dose <=0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (<=1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses <=0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.	false
0	Presenting Characteristics, Treatment Patterns, and Outcomes among Patients with Venous Thromboembolism during Hospitalization for COVID-19. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, limited data exist on patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and short-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. This is a prospective multinational study of patients with incident VTE during the course of hospitalization for COVID-19. Data were obtained from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbolica (RIETE) registry. All-cause mortality, VTE recurrences, and major bleeding during the first 10 days were separately investigated for patients in hospital wards versus those in intensive care units (ICUs). As of May 03, 2020, a total number of 455 patients were diagnosed with VTE (83% pulmonary embolism, 17% isolated deep vein thrombosis) during their hospital stay; 71% were male, the median age was 65 (interquartile range, 55-74) years. Most patients (68%) were hospitalized in medical wards, and 145 in ICUs. Three hundred and seventeen (88%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-91%) patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis at the time of VTE diagnosis. Most patients (88%) received therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin, and 15 (3.6%) received reperfusion therapies. Among 420 patients with complete 10-day follow-up, 51 (12%; 95% CI: 9.3-15%) died, no patient recurred, and 12 (2.9%; 95% CI: 1.6-4.8%) experienced major bleeding. The 10-day mortality rate was 9.1% (95% CI: 6.1-13%) among patients in hospital wards and 19% (95% CI: 13-26%) among those in ICUs. This study provides characteristics and early outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. Additional studies are needed to identify the optimal strategies to prevent VTE and to mitigate adverse outcomes associated. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.	false
0	Nanobodies-Useful Tools for Allergy Treatment?. In the last decade single domain antibodies (nanobodies, VHH) qualified through their unique characteristics have emerged as accepted and even advantageous alternative to conventional antibodies and have shown great potential as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Currently nanobodies find their main medical application area in the fields of oncology and neurodegenerative diseases. According to late-breaking information, nanobodies specific for coronavirus spikes have been generated these days to test their suitability as useful therapeutics for future outbreaks. Their superior properties such as chemical stability, high affinity to a broad spectrum of epitopes, low immunogenicity, ease of their generation, selection and production proved nanobodies also to be remarkable to investigate their efficacy for passive treatment of type I allergy, an exaggerated immune reaction to foreign antigens with increasing global prevalence.© Copyright © 2020 Flicker, Zettl and Tillib.	false
0	TCT CONNECT-218 Transcatheter Therapies For COVID-19. Background: Current strategies for COVID-19 therapy involve the systemic administration of drugs. While pharmaceutical treatments continue to be evaluated, device-based therapies have yet to be explored. We propose several transcatheter-based approaches for the treatment of COVID-19. Method(s): Four transcatheter-based solutions were explored in their potential uses for COVID-19 therapy: local drug delivery, energy-based and photodynamic therapy, and neuromodulation. Result(s): First is local, catheter-directed delivery of therapeutics directly to the lungs. A localized delivery of therapeutics could increase the bioavailability of drug(s) at the site of action, in comparison to systemic delivery alone. A second approach is light-based therapy. Considering the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and vasculoprotective characteristics of visible light energy (380 to 750 nm), a localized, light-based catheter therapeutic approach could prove to be effective. Given the distinct features of COVID-19 disease progression and its attack on hemoglobin and porphyrins, we suggest the infusion of porphyrin-based photosensitizers (PS). COVID-19 has an affinity for PS and would attach to these molecules, which would reduce hypoxic symptoms and allow for their deactivation through the photoactivation or sonoactivation of PS molecules. A third approach considers that several studies have demonstrated that viruses hold electrical charges. Neutralizing the charge of the virus within an electrical field is feasible to reduce the viral load using pacing wires and catheters placed near lungs. A final approach is the neuromodulation of the host inflammatory response. In a small preclinical study, the release of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced following transcutaneous low intensity focused ultrasound treatment of the spleen. Conclusion(s): Several catheter-based therapies for COVID-19 were discussed. It should be noted that in all approaches, the combination of a catheter-based therapy with systemic pharmaceutical therapy is recommended. Robust clinical trials with clinically meaningful and relevant endpoints will be needed to assess the feasibility and safety of these approaches. Categories Other: COVID-19Copyright © 2020	false
0	The inhaled steroid ciclesonide blocks SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by targeting the viral replication-transcription complex in cultured cells. Here, we screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and MERS-CoV replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 muM. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under the microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for treatment of MERS and COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	Longitudinal analysis of serology and neutralizing antibody levels in COVID19 convalescents. BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is crucial for diagnosis of prior infection and predicting future immunity., METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens., RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers., CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Myocardial Injury Is Associated with Higher Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 pandemic, a global health disaster, has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality across the globe since emerging on December 2019. Studies have shown that cardiovascular manifestations and complications linked to COVID-19 can be attributed to unfavorable clinical outcome and poor prognosis. Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in participating centers between March and June 2020 were included. Data including demographics, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and interventions were collected. Mortality and clinical outcomes in patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. A total of 143 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included (86.7% male; age 49.36 +/- 15.32 years). Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, and rhythm disturbances were noted in 34.3% of the study population and 21.7% had cardiac injury. In comparison with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were older (59 [33-89] vs 47 [22-94] years; P < 0.0001) and had more co-morbidities and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors (hypertension in 61.3% vs 24.1%; P < 0.0001, chronic heart failure in 16.1% vs 0%; P < 0.00001, diabetes mellitus 54.8% vs 31.3%; P 0.015, COPD/asthma 19.4% vs 3.6%; P 0.002); more patients with cardiac injury required invasive mechanical ventilation (77.4% vs 38.4%; P 0.00012). Complications were more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (87% vs 42.9%; P < 0.00001), acute kidney injury (67.7% vs 11.6%; P < 0.00001), and anemia (38.7% vs 3.6%;P < 0.00001). The need for renal replacement therapy was also higher in patients with cardiac injury (48.4% vs 3.6%; P < 0.00001). Noticeably, patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (53.3% vs 7.1%; P < 0.00001). In summary, myocardial injury is common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Oman in relation to older patients with more CV risk factors and comorbidities, and is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality and unfavorable clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Testosterone in COVID-19 - foe, friend or fatal victim?. The evidence derived from observational studies suggests male gender, diabetes and central obesity to be risk factors associated with an increased COVID-19-related case fatality. The precise pathophysiology behind this gender difference in mortality outcomes remains unclear at this stage, although it is worth exploring a possible role of testosterone as one of the contributory factors. The observed role of androgens in transcription of transmembrane protease serine-2, which facilitates COVID-19 anchoring to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cell surface receptors, seems to suggest that higher testosterone levels might be detrimental for outcomes. On the other hand, men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and central obesity have an increased prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion induced by inflammatory cytokines being one of the postulated mechanisms. The increased COVID-19 case fatality in this cohort might perhaps reflect an underlying pro-inflammatory state, with low testosterone levels being either a surrogate marker of a poor metabolic state or playing a more active role in propagation of inflammation and thrombosis.Copyright © 2020 Touch Briefings.

0	Prevalence of stress in healthcare professionals during the covid-19 pandemic in Northeast Mexico: A remote, fast survey evaluation, using an adapted covid-19 stress scales. The world is currently subjected to the worst health crisis documented in modern history: an epidemic led by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At the epicenter of this crisis, healthcare professionals continue working to safeguard our well-being. To the regular high levels of stress, COVID-19 adds even more so to healthcare professionals in particular, depending on their area, specialty, and type of work. Here we investigated what are the tendencies or areas most affected. Through an adaptation of the original COVID-stress scales, we developed a remote, fast test designed for healthcare professionals in the northeastern part of Mexico, an important part of the country with economic and cultural ties to the United States. Our results showed four key correlations as highly dependent: work area-xenophobia (p < 0.045), work with COVID patients-traumatic stress (p < 0.001), total number of COVID patients per day-traumatic stress (p < 0.027), and total number of COVID patients-compulsive checking and reassurance. Overall, we concluded that normal levels of stress have increased (mild-moderate). Additionally, we determine that the fear of being an asymptomatic patient (potential to spread without knowing) continues being a concern.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Severe COVID-19 patients with liver injury a seven-case series. We present the case details of seven patients diagnosed with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV, hereafter COVID-19) with hepatic injury. Most of these patients were elderly and had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and other underlying health conditions prior to admission for COVID-19. Liver injury occurred in all seven cases during the course of the disease. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels initially increased (1.2-times to 2.0-times the normal value, respectively) in the second week. The liver function recovered in all patients within one week of conventional liver protection treatment. Elevated serum transaminase levels in these patients were due to the COVID-19 infection but could also be related to systemic immune response caused by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and hepatocyte damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia. COVID-19 is highly infectious and mainly affects the lungs. In some cases, especially in patients with severe disease type, COVID-19 may also cause liver injury. The liver function of patients with severe COVID-19 should be very carefully monitored, especially if the patients are elderly and have underlying comorbidities.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

0	COVID-19 Outbreak in a Hemodialysis Center: A Retrospective Monocentric Case Series. Background: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to patients treated with kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Moreover, the impact of the disease on hemodialysis centers, the patients, and the health care workers is still not completely understood. Objective(s): We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design(s): A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting(s): A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patient(s): A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients' characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Method(s): Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and chi2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Result(s): Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P =.4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P =.3). Advanced age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were all found to be significantly related to death. Of the 18 infected health care professionals, 13 (72%) were symptomatic and 2 (11%) were hospitalized. There was no reported death among the health care workers. Limitation(s): Limited follow-up time compared with the course of the disease along with a small sample size. Conclusion(s): Patients treated with KRT show a high mortality rate secondary to COVID-19. CVD and age are shown to impact survival. Proactive measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the virus in such facilities. Trial Registration: Not applicable as this is a retrospective study.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Liver and Kidney Transplant During a 6-Month Period in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Center Experience. Objectives: With the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, many studies have indicated that elective surgeries should be postponed. However, post-ponement of transplants may cause diseases to get worse and increase the number in wait lists. We believe that, with precautions, transplant does not pose a risk during pandemic. Here, we aimed to evaluate our transplant results, which we safely performed during a 6-month pandemic period. Materials and Methods: Until September 2020, 3140 kidney and 667 liver transplants have been performed in our centers. We evaluated 38 kidney transplants and 9 liver transplants procedures performed during the pandemic (March 1 to September 2, 2020). Recipient and donor candidates were screened for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction and thoracic computed tomography. All recipients had routine immunosuppressive protocol. During hospitalization at our COVID-19-free transplant facility, we restricted the interactions during multidisciplinary rounds. Results: During the pandemic, 38 kidney transplants with an average length of hospital stay of 8.1 days were performed. Mean serum creatinine values of recipients were 0.91, 0.86, and 0.74 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. During the pandemic, 9 living donor liver transplants (1 adult, 8 pediatric) were performed with an average length of hospital stay of 17.1 days. Mean serum total bilirubin levels were 0.9, 0.5, and 0.4 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. Mean serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were 38.1, 28.3, and 22.3 U/L on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. All recipients and donors were successfully discharged. Only 1 liver recipient died (on day 55 after discharge as a result of oxalosis-induced heart failure). Conclusions: According to our results, when precautions are taken, transplant does not pose a risk to patients during the pandemic period. We attribute the safety and success shown to our newly developed protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Rotational thromboelastometry results are associated with care level in COVID-19. High prevalence of thrombotic events in severely ill COVID-19 patients have been reported. Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment. The primary aim of this study was to test whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) at admission indicates hypercoagulopathy and predicts the disease severity, assessed as care level, in COVID-19 patients. The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: (1) regular wards or (2) wards with specialized ventilation support. Conventional coagulation tests, blood type and ROTEM were taken at admission. 60 patients were included; age 61 (median), 67% men, many with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with in patients at regular wards (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present early in patients with mild to moderate disease, and more pronounced in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Non-O blood types were not overrepresented in COVID-19 positive patients. ROTEM variables showed hypercoagulopathy at admission and this pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity. If this feature is to be used to predict the risk of thromboembolic complications further studies are warranted.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false

0	Anti-spike, Anti-nucleocapsid and Neutralizing Antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 Inpatients and Asymptomatic Individuals. A better understanding of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response is necessary to finely evaluate commercial serological assays but also to predict protection against reinfection and to help the development of vaccines. For this reason, we monitored the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in infected patients. In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients 2 weeks post-symptom onset and that the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2, we also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 samples from asymptomatic individuals that were shown SARS-CoV-2 seropositive using commercial serological tests. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau 2 weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients but they were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic patients. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 does not induce a prolonged neutralizing antibody response. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.	false
0	Can data from paediatric cohorts solve the COVID-19 puzzle?. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is significantly more severe in adults than in children. The biological reasons for this difference remain to be elucidated. We have compared the most recent virological and immunological data related to COVID-19 between adults and children and contrasted this with earlier data from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the related SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. Based on these available data, a number of hypotheses are proposed to explain the difference in COVID-19 clinical outcomes between adults and children. NF-kB may be a key factor that could explain the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in adults as well as rare complications associated with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in paediatric COVID-19 patients.Copyright: © 2020 Do et al.

0	Prevalence of Diabetes, Management and Outcomes among Covid-19 Adult Patients Admitted in a Specialized Tertiary Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This retrospective study aimed to characterize comorbidities and associated with mortality among hospitalized adults with Covid-19 managed as perthe Saudi Ministry of Health protocol in a specialized tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Medical records of 300 adult patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection and admitted in King Salman Hospital (KSH) from May 1 to July 31 2020 were included. Medical history, management and outcomes were noted. Males significantly outnumber females (259 versus 41). South Asians comprise 41% of all admitted patients. Mortality rate was 10% and highest among Saudi males (28.9%). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was the most common comorbidity (45.7%). Almost all patients (99%) had pneumonia. Patients >50 years were three times more likely to die (confidence interval, CI 1.3-6.9; p=0.01) from Covid-19. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio OR 19.4, CI-1.5-260.0; p=0.02) and acute kidney injury (OR 11.7, CI-4.7-28.6; p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher mortality. Dexamethasone use significantly improved the final outcome based on net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) (p<0.05). In this single-center study, T2DM was very common among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Patients >50 years, those with congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury are at higher risk for worse Covid-19 outcome. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

0	Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via close contact and respiratory droplets among human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mice. We simulated 3 transmission modes, including close-contact, respiratory droplets and aerosol routes, in the laboratory. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be highly transmitted among naive human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice via close contact because 7 of 13 naive hACE2 mice were SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositive 14 days after being introduced into the same cage with 3 infectedhACE2 mice. For respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from 3 of 10 naive hACE2 mice showed seropositivity 14 days after introduction into the same cage with 3 infected-hACE2 mice, separated by grids. In addition, hACE2 mice cannot be experimentally infected via aerosol inoculation until continued up to 25 minutes with high viral concentrations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Preventing vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic: UK definitions of vitamin D sufficiency and recommended supplement dose are set too low. There is growing evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with risk of COVID-19. It is therefore distressing that there is major disagreement about the optimal serum level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and appropriate supplement dose. The UK Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has set the lowest level for defining sufficiency (10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L) of any national advisory body or scientific society and consequently recommends supplementation with 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day. We have searched for published evidence to support this but not found it. There is considerable evidence to support the higher level for sufficiency (20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and the American Institute of Medicine and hence greater supplementation (20 micrograms or 800 IU per day). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the UK typically fall by around 50% through winter. We believe that governments should urgently recommend supplementation with 20-25 micrograms (800-1,000 IU) per day.

0	Healthcare utilization patterns among persons who use drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Persons with drug use disorders are an underserved and stigmatized population, and the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate these issues. The discussion around those with drug use disorders in the midst of the pandemic has focused on the need to ensure uninterrupted treatment access; however, very few in this population actually receive treatment, and retention is a substantial issue among those who do. Evidence from other chronic conditions suggests persons at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications are foregoing care due to fear of contracting the virus. Persons with drug use disorders tend to fall into this high-risk category, and thus may be avoiding healthcare facilities. Our data suggest this is true. If so, adverse outcomes, and increased severity of use disorders and associated health complications, could become prevalent. Clinicians should identify persons with drug use disorders who may be foregoing treatment, and engage them using methods that minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

0	The association of ABO blood group with indices of disease severity and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19. Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) suggest a protective effect of anti-A antibodies against viral cell entry that may hold relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether ABO blood groups are associated with different severities of COVID-19. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis and nested prospective observational substudy of critically ill patients with COVID-19. We collected data pertaining to age, sex, comorbidities, dates of symptom onset, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), standard laboratory parameters, and serum inflammatory cytokines. National (N = 398671; P = .38) and provincial (n = 62246; P = .60) ABO blood group distributions did not differ from our cohort (n = 95). A higher proportion of COVID-19 patients with blood group A or AB required mechanical ventilation (P = .02) and CRRT (P = .004) and had a longer ICU stay (P = .03) compared with patients with blood group O or B. Blood group A or AB also had an increased probability of requiring mechanical ventilation and CRRT after adjusting for age, sex, and presence of >=1 comorbidity. Inflammatory cytokines did not differ between patients with blood group A or AB (n = 11) vs O or B (n = 14; P > .10 for all cytokines). Collectively, our data indicate that critically ill COVID-19 patients with blood group A or AB are at increased risk for requiring mechanical ventilation, CRRT, and prolonged ICU admission compared with patients with blood group O or B. Further work is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of inpatients with Coronavirus disease 2019 and acute ischemic stroke: from epidemiology to outcomes. Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) is currently the most frequently reported neurological complication of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article will elaborate on the clinical features of inpatients with COVID-19 and AIS and the pathophysiological mechanism of AIS under the background of COVID-19. Through a detailed search of relevant studies, we found that the incidence of AIS among COVID-19 patients varied from 0.9% to 4.6%, and AIS has been observed in many people without underlying diseases and cardiovascular risk factors as well as young people. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of COVID-19 patients with AIS was higher than historical AIS patients, and the proportion of large vessel occlusion (LVO) was about 64.2%. COVID-19 patients with AIS have commonly high levels of D-D dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. The pooled mortality of COVID-19 patients with AIS was 38% and the mortality of LVO patients is higher (45.9%). Compared with COVID-19-negative AIS patients in the same period in 2020 and 2019, COVID- 19 patients with AIS had a worse prognosis.

0	A spatiotemporal analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on child abuse and neglect in the city of Los Angeles, California. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) has created an urgent need to identify child abuse and neglect (CAN) and efficiently allocate resources to improve the coordination of responses during a public health crisis. Objective(s): To provide unique insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of CAN in relation to COVID-19 outcomes and identify areas where CAN has increased or decreased during the pandemic. Participant(s): Children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Setting(s): CAN incidents in the city of Los Angeles. Method(s): Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the implementation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored. Result(s): There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion(s): Our findings reinforce the utility of developing intervention strategies that minimize harm to children by targeting resources to specific challenges facing families enduring the COVID-19 experience.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Antibody kinetics and serologic profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infection using two serologic assays. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging threat worldwide. This study aims to assess the serologic profiles and time kinetics of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with COVID-19 using two immunoassays., METHODS: A total of 97 samples serially collected from 17 patients with COVID-19 and 137 negative control samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using the AFIAS COVID-19 Ab (Boditech Med Inc., Chuncheon, Republic of Korea) and the EDI TM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit (Epitope Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA)., RESULTS: With both assays, IgM and IgG rapidly increased after 7 days post symptom onset (PSO). IgM antibody levels reached a peak at 15-35 d PSO and gradually decreased. IgG levels gradually increased and remained at similar levels after 22-35 d. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgM/IgG for <=14d PSO were 21.4%/35.7~57.1% and increased to 41.2~52.9%/88.2~94.1% at >14 d PSO with specificities of 98.5%/94.2% for AFIAS COVID-19 Ab and 100.0%/96.4% for EDI TM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit. Among 137 negative controls, 12 samples (8.8%) showed positive or indeterminate results., CONCLUSIONS: The antibody kinetics against SARS-CoV-2 are similar to common findings of acute viral infectious diseases. Antibody testing is useful for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 d PSO, detecting past infection, and epidemiologic surveys.	false

0	Outpatient Ultrafiltration to Prevent Hospital Readmission During Covid 19 Pandemic in Diuretic Intolerant Patient: Case Study. Introduction: Heart Failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults greater than 65 years of age in the U.S. and results in over 1,000,000 hospitalizations annually. Despite advances in medical therapeutics, mortality remains high. Adjustments in workflow across hospital systems have been instituted to reduce HF hospitalizations. Ambulatory HF clinics have helped in this regard. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need to minimize utilization of hospital resources and limit patient hospital admissions is paramount. Inpatient ultrafiltration (UF) has been utilized to improve congestion in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Less is known of outpatient utilization of UF in the ambulatory HF patient. We present a case of outpatient UF to reduce congestion in an ambulatory HF patient to minimize hospitalization in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. Case: A 70-year-old female with HF preserved ejection fraction, combined pre and post pulmonary capillary hypertension, with chronic dyspnea on continuous home oxygen, who presented to the HF clinic. The patient had previous multiple hospitalizations due to recurrent congestion, with therapies limited by dermatologic biopsy proven allergy to sulfa based diuretics. She had failed various diuretic regimens with recurrent desquamating whole body rash. She had recurrent weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and again was refractory to outpatient therapies. Given her co-morbidities, she was deemed high risk for COVID-19 exposure. A decision to proceed with outpatient UF was made. The day of outpatient HF clinic visit, we placed a brachial dual lumen 16-gauge extended length catheter. A heparin drip was initiated thirty minutes prior to the start of UF per protocol. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl and estimated GFR was 44. Initial outpatient session was performed over a total of 4-hours with isolated veno-venous UF utilizing the Aquadex Flex Flow system at a rate of 200 cc/hr fluid removal. The patient completed a total of 4 sessions, and total fluid removal was 4950mL. (Table 1) The patient had immediate improvement in symptoms. Discussion(s): UF is a method of decongestion that can be used as an alternative to loop diuretics. Simplified UF devices can utilize peripheral venous access, low blood flows, and small extracorporeal blood volume. Previous experience with intermittent outpatient UF utilizing peritoneal dialysis and hemofiltration has been reported, though not widely utilized. This is the first case to report the use of the Aquadex Flex Flow system to provide outpatient UF therapies in the COVID-19 era. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing cardiac and pulmonary disease, including congestive HF, increase risk of serious complications from exposure to SARS-COVID-2 virus. We report a novel case of minimizing exposure risk of a congested HF patient using outpatient isolated veno-venous UF in the ambulatory setting.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Chinese Residents' Perceptions During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Online Cross-Sectional Survey. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a global threat due to substantial morbidity and mortality, and health education strategies need to be adjusted timely to prevent a possible epidemic rebound., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 among individuals coming to, returning to, or living in the Jiangsu Province of China, and realize the impact of epidemic development on public's perceptions., METHODS: In this study, an online self-designed questionnaire was used between February 15 and April 21, 2020. Factors influencing the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score for COVID-19 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) and its 95% credible interval were calculated and compared with the daily participation number and protection scores., RESULTS: A total of 52,066 participants were included in the study; their average knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were 25.58 (SD 4.22), 24.05 (SD 4.02), 31.51 (SD 2.84), and 90.02 (SD 8.87), respectively, and 65.91% (34,315/52,066) of them had a total protection score above 90 points. For the knowledge and skill sections, correct rates of questions on medical observation days, infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, cough or sneeze treatment, and precautions were higher than 95%, while those of questions on initial symptoms, transmission routes, selection of disinfection products, and measures of home quarantine were relatively low: 62.01%, 71.32%, 71.81%, and 76.90%, respectively. For the actual behavior section, 97.93% of participants could wear masks properly when going out. However, 19.76% could not disinfect their homes each week, and 18.42% could not distinguish the initial symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19. The regression analyses showed that the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were influenced by sex, age, educational level, occupation, and place of residence at different degrees (P<.001). The government, television shows, and news outlets were the main sources for protection knowledge, and the information released by the government and authoritative medical experts was considered the most reliable. The current information needs included the latest epidemic development, disease treatment progress, and daily protection knowledge. The Rt in the Jiangsu Province and Chinese Mainland dropped below 1, while the global Rt remained at around 1. The maximal information coefficients (MICs) ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that public's perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic development., CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of the participants had better COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. It is then necessary to apply different health education measures based on the characteristics of resuming work and study to guide some specific populations to improve their protection perceptions ultimately to prevent the possible rebound of COVID-19., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Short term, high-dose vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 disease: a randomised, placebo-controlled, study (SHADE study). BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has an immunomodulatory role but the effect of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known., AIM: Effect of high dose, oral cholecalciferol supplementation on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance., DESIGN: Randomised, placebo-controlled., PARTICIPANTS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D<20 ng/ml) individuals., INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to receive daily 60 000 IU of cholecalciferol (oral nano-liquid droplets) for 7 days with therapeutic target 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml (intervention group) or placebo (control group). Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded. 25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7, and cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D <50 ng/ml in the intervention arm. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory markers fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin and (CRP), ferritin were measured periodically., OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21 and change in inflammatory markers., RESULTS: Forty SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were randomised to intervention (n=16) or control (n=24) group. Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 8.6 (7.1 to 13.1) and 9.54 (8.1 to 12.5) ng/ml (p=0.730), in the intervention and control group, respectively. 10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml by day-7 and another two by day-14 [day-14 25(OH)D levels 51.7 (48.9 to 59.5) ng/ml and 15.2 (12.7 to 19.5) ng/ml (p<0.001) in intervention and control group, respectively]. 10 (62.5%) participants in the intervention group and 5 (20.8%) participants in the control arm (p<0.018) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation (intergroup difference 0.70 ng/ml; P=0.007) unlike other inflammatory biomarkers., CONCLUSION: Greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection turned SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative with a significant decrease in fibrinogen on high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation., TRIAL REGISTER NUMBER: NCT04459247.

0	Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in an elderly liver transplant patient infected by COVID-19: a case report. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic gripped the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all populations. Immunosuppressed patients have greater risk for opportunistic infections. However, the understanding regarding the biological characteristics of SARSCoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients remains unclear. Herein, we present a case of prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in a liver transplant patient with COVID-19. A 61-year-old male post liver transplant was confirmed COVID-19 infection on day 10 of illness onset. The patient has received immunosuppressive treatment for over 11 years and has a history of hypertension for 10 years. With antiviral treatment and temporary discontinuation of tacrolimus immunosuppression, he had complete clinical symptoms relieve on day 24. However, recurrently positive tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were presented on day 35 and on day 39 after two consecutive negative tests. IgG antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive with IgM negative on day 41. The final shedding duration lasted 52 days. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 should be a matter of concern and might attribute to long-term immunosuppression. Therefore, dynamic surveillance and prolonged quarantine are required for immunocompromised individuals. Further data should be collected to investigate if there is a universal prolonged shedding window of SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients.	false
0	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CRITICALLY ILL YOUNG ADULT PATIENTS. SESSION TITLE: Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: As the novel coronavirus continues to affect over 200 countries, resulting in greater than 350,000 deaths to date, older age is known to confer increased risk for severe disease. However, younger patients may be affected by severe disease as well, and limited literature focuses on the characteristics of these patients. Within a cohort of the first 137 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care public hospital in the first month of the outbreak in New York City, we found a higher proportion of younger patients than previously reported. This case series describes baseline demographics, ICU course, and outcomes of 29 consecutive, critically ill patients under age 50 with known COVID-19. METHOD(S): This retrospective observational study includes adults 18 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our ICU between March 10 and April 7, 2020. Data were manually abstracted from electronic health records. RESULT(S): The majority of our cohort was male (23/29, 79.5%) and had an elevated BMI >25 (23/29, 79.5%). We found a high prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, similar to rates reported in other cohorts of COVID-19 patients. However, 37.9% (11/29) of our cohort had no known medical conditions at presentation. This subset was entirely male, three quarters were Hispanic, 3 had obesity, 7 were overweight, and 1 had normal BMI. By the April 22 follow-up, 12/29 (41%) patients had died, 13/29 (45%) had been discharged from the ICU, and 4/29 (14%) were still in the ICU. 4/26 (15%) patients required initiation of renal replacement therapy. 25/29 (86%) patients required mechanical ventilation and 23/29 (79%) required pressors. One patient was supported on VV ECMO. 19/29 (66%) met criteria for ARDS. CONCLUSION(S): Evidence thus far suggests that advanced age increases the risk of severe COVID-19 disease; however, we found that critical illness and death were not limited to higher-risk age groups. While smoking is a proposed risk factor for COVID-19 severity, we found that more than half of the patients with documented smoking status had no smoking history. Interestingly, 38% of patients under age 50 had no past medical history on presentation to the hospital, but more than half were overweight and an additional third had obesity. Obesity has been proposed as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in younger patients, suggesting that, in populations with high prevalence of obesity such as the United States, COVID-19 may have a more severe effect on younger populations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These initial findings support a need for additional research into the risk factors for younger COVID-19 patients to progress to critical illness and death.

Background: COVID-19 has been the catalyst for a quantum shift in our professional and personal lives, literally and figuratively within the blink of an eyelash. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been profoundly impacted by this disruption at all levels, especially those working in high-stress specialties, such as cardiology, in resource-deprived and population-dense areas in developing countries, such as India. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of HCWs working in a high-stress, high-turnover cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) of a tertiary care center in India. Questionnaires, results, and conclusions detailed in this presentation. Considering the fact that India has not even reached the peak of the pandemic, the negative psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on HCWs of the cardiovascular community is highly concerning and disheartening. Simplistic, sustainable long-term action plans are the need of the hour. We must use the cataclysm wrought by COVID-19 to plug our broken healthcare systems. For that, our frontline warriors should be in the best state of physical, mental, and emotional well-being to face up to this challenge. The time to take action is NOW!! Methods: Evaluate the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on HCWs working in a highly-stressed environment with high patient burden and turnover rates (45 bedded CICU including 15 step-down beds; average occupancy 90% to 100%).

0	Changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement due to COVID-19 and depressive symptomatology: A cross-sectional a population-based study. BACKGROUND: The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants., METHODS: We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology., RESULTS: The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI=10.3-15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score., CONCLUSION: The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.

0	Head-to-head evaluation on diagnostic accuracies of six SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. In this study, we evaluated and compared six SARS-CoV-2 serology kits including the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, Beckman Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, OCD Vitros OCD Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assay, Roche Elecsys Anti SARS-CoV-2 assay, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total assay, and cPass surrogate viral neutralising antibody assay. A total of 336 non-duplicated residual serum samples that were obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients (n=173) on PCR and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic were used for the study. These were concurrently analysed on the different immunoassay platforms and correlated with clinical characteristics. Our results showed all assays had specificity ranging from 99.3% to 100.0%. Overall sensitivity across all days of symptoms, in descending order were OCD (49.1%, 95% CI 41.8-56.5%), cPass (44.8%, 95% CI 37.5-52.3%), Roche (41.6%, 95% CI 34.5-49.0%), Siemens (39.9%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%), Abbott (39.8%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%) and Beckman (39.6%, 95% CI 32.5-47.3%). Testing after at least 14 days from symptom onset is required to achieve AUCs greater than 0.80. OCD and cPass performed the best in terms of sensitivity for >21 days symptoms with 93.3% (95% CI, 73.5-99.2%) and 96.7% (95% CI, 82.8-99.9%), respectively. Both also shared the greatest concordance, kappa 0.963 (95% CI 0.885-1.0), p<0.001, and had the lowest false negative rates. Serology results should be interpreted with caution in certain cases. False negatives were observed in a small number of individuals with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive therapy, pauci-symptomatic or who received antiretroviral therapy. In conclusion, all assays exhibited excellent specificity and total antibody assays with spike protein configurations generally outperformed nucleocapsid configurations and IgG assays in terms of diagnostic sensitivity.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia	false
0	Hyperinflammation and the utility of immunomodulatory medications in children with COVID-19. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally coupled with the relatively high case-fatality rate has led to immediate need for therapeutic intervention to prevent and treat COVID-19 disease. There is accumulating evidence that morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 may be exacerbated by a dysregulated host immune response resulting in significant hyperinflammation and cytokine release. The aim of this review is to describe the basis for the immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to examine current investigations into immunomodulatory therapies aimed at targeting the excessive host immune response.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Thoracic surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Madrid, Spain: single-centre report. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 cases and the postoperative outcomes of patients who had thoracic surgery during the beginning and at the highest point of transmission in our community. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed patients who had undergone elective thoracic surgery from 12 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 and were symptomatic or tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection within 14days after surgery, with a focus on their complications and potential deaths. RESULT(S): Out of 101 surgical procedures, including 57 primary oncological resections, 6 lung transplants and 18 emergency procedures, only 5 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were identified, 3 in the immediate postoperative period and 2 as outpatients. All 5 patients had cancer; the median age was 64years. The main virus-related symptom was fever (80%), and the median onset of coronavirus disease 2019 was 3days. Although 80% of the patients who had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 required in-hospital care, none of them were considered severe or critical and none died. CONCLUSION(S): These results indicate that, in properly selected cases, with short preoperative in-hospital stays, strict isolation and infection control protocols, managed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, a surgical procedure could be performed with a relatively low risk for the patient.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	The intriguing course of coronavirus and its age dependent variation in the disease outcome-a concise update. Coronavirus is part of a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that infect mammals. COVID-19 pandemic which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] has affected hundreds of thousands of people worldwide with a rapid spreading and mutating strain of the virus. Morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infections vary extensively from asymptomatic, mild to deadly and critical. Strangely, children were found to be protected from severe or deadly critical infections due to various reasons, on the other hand elderly with co-morbidities and immunocompromised adults were the most affected by this virus. Children with COVID-19 infection also present with similar symptoms as adults such as fever, dry cough, runny nose and nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, abdominal pain and fatigue or may remain asymptomatic. Children have been found to harbour large amounts of virus and can probably transmit viruses even when they are asymptomatic hence can be a prominent carrier of the disease. Even though many studies have been conducted to ascertain the reasons for the differential consequences of the disease in adults and children, the present review was done to throw light and fill the gap on the age determined variations in the outcome of covid-19.Copyright © 2020, J.

0	Corona Virus Infectious Disease 19 (COVID-19) in Various Reviews. The current COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. It accesses host cells through the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which is expressed by endothelial cells (EC) and very abundantly expressed in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 uses a surface glycoprotein (peplomer) called a spike to access host cells and ACE2 has been revealed to be a co-receptor for coronavirus entry. The antigen presentation of SARS-CoV mainly depends on the MHC I molecule, but MHC II also contributes to the presentation. Based on the mechanism of a common acute viral infection, the antibody profile against the SARS-CoV virus contains characteristic pattern of IgM and IgG production. By the end of week 12, SARS-specific IgM antibodies disappear, whereas IgG antibodies can last in a longer period of time, which shows IgG antibodies can mainly hold a protective role, and SARS-specific IgG antibodies mainly are S-specific and N-specific antibodies. Clinical manifestations are not only found in mucosa in the airways but also in the cardiovascular system, kidneys, central nervous system, pregnancy, skin, oral cavity and digestive system. The diagnose of clinical presentation of COVID-19 is mainly based on a history of epidemiology, clinical manifestations of pneumonia symptoms (for example, fever, dry cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath) and several additional examinations, include detection of nucleic acids, CT scanning, immune identification technology (POCT) ) IgM / IgG, related to enzymes, immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and blood culture.Copyright © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

0	Chest CT in COVID-19: What the Radiologist Needs to Know. Chest CT has a potential role in the diagnosis, detection of complications, and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Implementation of appropriate precautionary safety measures, chest CT protocol optimization, and a standardized reporting system based on the pulmonary findings in this disease will enhance the clinical utility of chest CT. However, chest CT examinations may lead to both false-negative and false-positive results. Furthermore, the added value of chest CT in diagnostic decision making is dependent on several dynamic variables, most notably available resources (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] tests, personal protective equipment, CT scanners, hospital and radiology personnel availability, and isolation room capacity) and the prevalence of both COVID-19 and other diseases with overlapping manifestations at chest CT. Chest CT is valuable to detect both alternative diagnoses and complications of COVID-19 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure), while its role for prognostication requires further investigation. The authors describe imaging and managing care of patients with COVID-19, with topics including (a) chest CT protocol, (b) chest CT findings of COVID-19 and its complications, (c) the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT and its role in diagnostic decision making and prognostication, and (d) reporting and communicating chest CT findings. The authors also review other specific topics, including the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the World Health Organization case definition, the value of performing RT-PCR tests, and the radiology department and personnel impact related to performing chest CT in COVID-19. ©RSNA, 2020.	false
0	"Coronavirus COVID- 19: A critical review of its history, pathogenesis, transmission, diagnosis and treatment. The outbreak of the deadly virus (novel coronavirus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) that emerged in December 2019, remained a controversial subject of intense speculations regarding its origin, became a worldwide health problem resulting in serious coronavirus disease of 2019 (acronym COVID-19). The concern regarding this new viral strain ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2"" (acronym SARS-CoV-2) and diseases it causes (COVID-19) is well deserved at all levels. The incidence of COVID-19 infection and infectious patients are increasing at a high rate. Coronaviruses (CoVs), enclosed positive-sense RNA viruses, are distinguished by club-like spikes extending from their surface, an exceptionally large genome of RNA, and a special mechanism for replication. Coronaviruses are associated with a broad variety of human and other animal diseases spanning from enteritis in cattle and pigs and upper chicken respiratory disease to extremely lethal human respiratory infections. With world health organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 as pandemic, we deemed it necessary to provide a detailed review of coronaviruses discussing their 2019 Novel Coronavirus, history, current situation, coronavirus classification, pathogenesis, structure, mode of action, diagnosis and treatment, the effect of environmental factors, risk reduction and guidelines to understand the virus and develop ways to control it.

0	Guidance for Restarting Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy in Patients Who Withheld Immunosuppressant Medications During COVID-19. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] are frequently treated with immunosuppressant medications. During the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic, recommendations for IBD management have included that patients should stay on their immunosuppressant medications if they are not infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], but to temporarily hold these medications if symptomatic with COVID-19 or asymptomatic but have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. As more IBD patients are infected globally, it is important to also understand how to manage IBD medications during convalescence while an individual with IBD is recovering from COVID-19. In this review, we address the differences between a test-based versus a symptoms-based strategy as related to COVID-19, and offer recommendations on when it is appropriate to consider restarting IBD therapy in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19. In general, we recommend a symptoms-based approach, due to the current lack of confidence in the accuracy of available testing and the clinical significance of prolonged detection of virus via molecular testing.

0	Are patients with asthma and COPD preferred targets of COVID-19?. The coronavirus pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an infectious respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first identified in patients from Wuhan, China. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spread swiftly around world and infected more than 25 million people and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD appear to be a risk factor for COVID-19; however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to resolve them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medication used against SARS-CoV-2 may have greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions, already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss the importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.	false
0	The Role of Molecular Chaperones in Virus Infection and Implications for Understanding and Treating COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic made imperative the search for means to end it, which requires a knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the multiplication and spread of its cause, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many viruses use members of the hosts' chaperoning system to infect the target cells, replicate, and spread, and here we present illustrative examples. Unfortunately, the role of chaperones in the SARS-CoV-2 cycle is still poorly understood. In this review, we examine the interactions of various coronaviruses during their infectious cycle with chaperones in search of information useful for future research on SARS-CoV-2. We also call attention to the possible role of molecular mimicry in the development of autoimmunity and its widespread pathogenic impact in COVID-19 patients. Viral proteins share highly antigenic epitopes with human chaperones, eliciting anti-viral antibodies that crossreact with the chaperones. Both, the critical functions of chaperones in the infectious cycle of viruses and the possible role of these molecules in COVID-19 autoimmune phenomena, make clear that molecular chaperones are promising candidates for the development of antiviral strategies. These could consist of inhibiting-blocking those chaperones that are necessary for the infectious viral cycle, or those that act as autoantigens in the autoimmune reactions causing generalized destructive effects on human tissues.	false
0	Treatment for COVID-19: An overview. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a characteristic hyperinflammatory response, vascular damage, microangiopathy, angiogenesis and widespread thrombosis. Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Variable Performance in 6 Commercial SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays May Affect Convalescent Plasma and Seroprevalence Screening. OBJECTIVES: Serologic detection of prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is needed for definition of convalescent plasma donors, for confounding SARS-CoV-2 presentation, and for seroprevalence studies. Reliable serologic assays with independent validation are required., METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays from Beckman Coulter, Euroimmun (IgG, IgA), Roche, and Siemens (Centaur, Vista) were assessed for specificity (n = 184), sensitivity (n = 154), and seroconversion in a defined cohort with clinical correlates and molecular SARS-CoV-2 results., RESULTS: Assay specificity was 99% or greater for all assays except the Euroimmun IgA (95%). Sensitivity at more than 21 days from symptom onset was 84%, 95%, 72%, 98%, 67%, and 96% for Beckman Coulter, Centaur, Vista, Roche, Euroimmun IgA, and Euroimmun IgG, respectively. Average day of seroconversion was similar between assays (8-10 d), with 2 patients not producing nucleocapsid antibodies during hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies may be less reliably produced early in disease than spike protein antibodies. Assessment of convalescent plasma donors at more than 30 days from symptom onset and seroprevalence studies should use assays with defined sensitivity at time points of interest because not all assays detected antibodies reliably at more than 30 days.

0	Higher levels of IL-6 early after tocilizumab distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors in COVID-19 pneumonia: A possible indication for deeper targeting of IL-6. Introduction: The most serious COVID-19 deriving from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a cytokine release storm and it is associated with worse outcomes. In COVID-19 patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL-6 preliminarily resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL-6 24 to 48 hours before and 12 to 48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors were performed. Result(s): Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL-6 was not different at baseline (P =.41), while 24 to 48 hours post-tocilizumab IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (2398.5 [430.5-9372] vs 290.5 [58.5-1305.5] pg/mL, P =.022). Serum IL-6 post-tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors (area under the curve, 0.815; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.99, P =.02). Conclusion(s): Repeated measurement of the serum level of IL-6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish nonsurvivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

When this pandemic started to unfold with drastic changes all over the world, children being silent observers became silent victims of the pandemic. The number of children being diagnosed with COVID-19 is far less as compared to adults, however the stress of an ongoing pandemic is evident in pediatric population as well. Anxiety, depression, fear in children are few of the main challenges we have to face. World Health Organization, Center for Disease Control and UNICEF have also expressed their concerns over the pandemic's mental health and psycho-social consequences for children. Practical strategies should be adopted at individual, institutional and national level to counter the ill effects in a timely manner.Copyright © 2020, Pakistan Pediatric Journal.

0	Antiviral therapy of acute respiratory infections in children during coronavirus pandemic: A review of studies and clinical experience. In the beginning of summer 2020, were observed some positive trends in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, which made it possible to ease quarantine measures in several countries. This inevitably increases contacts between children of different ages and the incidence of various acute respiratory infections. Considering non-specific clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children, the prevalence of mild and moderate forms in the pediatric population, and difficulties associated with differential diagnosis between respiratory monoinfections and mixed infecions during the pandemic, it is necessary to use direct action antiviral drugs from the first days of the disease. This review focuses on antiviral effects of umifenovir evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials and the possibility of its use in children aged 2 years and older.Copyright © 2020, Dynasty Publishing House.

0	Role of aerosols in the spread of covid-19-a review. The COVID-19 pandemic was identified in late 2019 at Wuhan, China. Its outbreak causes respiratory illness. It is considered to be a potential zoonotic disease and is asymptomatic or flu-like.SARS is a new clinical entity of the COVID-19 outbreak. The other symptoms are fever, sore throat, cold. They spread through droplets, saliva, or sneeze. They are also transmitted to the child by placental transmission. The airborne transmission is by aerosols where droplets are >5microm. They become bioaerosols and are found to travel more than 100 meters. In experimental work, it is found that the particles of COVID can be detected 3 hours after no clinical setting. The only way to stop the spread is appropriate preventive measures like PPE, respiratory etiquette, and social distancing. There are some recent advances in the field to stop the spread of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the transmission and spread of coronavirus by aerosols and the various preventive measures used by medical practitioners to stop the spread of this pandemic.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false
0	Response to the Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) Pandemic Across Africa: Successes, Challenges, and Implications for the Future. Background The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed considerable lives. There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment. Alongside this, concerns that lockdown and other measures will have on prevention and management of other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are an increasing issue with rising morbidity and mortality rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that a lack of nets and treatment could result in up to 18 million additional cases of malaria and up to 30,000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective Document current prevalence and mortality rates from COVID-19 alongside economic and other measures to reduce its spread and impact across Africa. In addition, suggested ways forward among all key stakeholder groups. Our Approach Contextualise the findings from a wide range of publications including internet-based publications coupled with input from senior-level personnel. Ongoing Activities Prevalence and mortality rates are currently lower in Africa than among several Western countries and the USA. This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors. Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment. There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines. There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19. Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination. However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality. Conclusion There are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries. Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities. Countries are learning from each other.	false
0	Adaptation of advanced clinical virology assays from HIV-1 to SARS-CoV-2. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In response to the HIV-AIDS pandemic, great strides have been made in developing molecular methods that accurately quantify nucleic acid products of HIV-1 at different stages of viral replication and to assess HIV-1 sequence diversity and its effect on susceptibility to small molecule inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies. Here, we review how knowledge gained from these approaches, including viral RNA quantification and sequence analyses, have been rapidly applied to study SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic., RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood of infected individuals by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR); and, as in HIV-1 infection, there is growing evidence that the level of viral RNA in plasma may be related to COVID disease severity. Unlike HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly conserved limiting SARS-CoV-2 sequencing applications to investigating interpatient genetic diversity for phylogenetic analysis. Sensitive sequencing technologies, originally developed for HIV-1, will be needed to investigate intrapatient SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation in response to antiviral therapeutics and vaccines., SUMMARY: Methods used for HIV-1 have been rapidly applied to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 to understand pathogenesis and prognosis. Further application of such methods should improve precision of therapy and outcome.	false
0	The bumpy road to achieve herd immunity in COVID-19. Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection that is offered to the community when a large proportion of individuals contained in the community are immune to a certain infection. This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable. The duration of herd immunity is another issue while information on the long-term immune response against SARS-CoV2 is yet scarce. Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population. Without being exhaustive, throughout our paper we will elaborate on each of the hurdles encountered in developing herd immunity to SARS-Cov2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Coronavirus disease 2019 infection among children: Pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that may lead to respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Neonates and children are most vulnerable population to COVID-19 infection; however, the infection is usually milder and has a better prognosis in pediatric patients compared with adults. It remains unclear why pediatric population is less symptomatic than adults. Children frequently experience respiratory infections and their immune system is in developing stage. However, large proportion of the asymptomatic pediatric population may contribute to transmission. This review explores several aspects of COVID-19 infection such as its epidemiology, its molecular pathogenesis with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and inflammatory mediators, intrauterine vertical transmission, imaging findings, and complications like cytokine release syndrome (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). We also looked at prognostic factors and treatment modalities like corticosteroids, RNA replicate inhibitors, protease inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that is, acalabrutinib and convalescent plasma therapy. Since there is no strong evidence for the intrauterine transmission, early isolation should be performed to protect a neonate from a COVID-19 infected mother. Development of vaccine and an effective antiviral drug are the need of the hour.Copyright © by Georg Thieme Verlag KG.	false
0	Human genetic factors associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity. Abstract: Background: The emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 marked the synchronization of the world to a peculiar clock that is counting infected cases and deaths instead of hours and minutes. The pandemic, highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has indeed caused considerable morbidity and mortality and drastically changed our everyday lives. As we continue to become acquainted with the seventh coronavirus known to infect our species, a number of its characteristics keep surprising us. Among those is the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which ranges from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. Main body: Data, now from patient populations, are beginning to accumulate on human genetic factors that may contribute to the observed diversified disease severity. Therefore, we deemed it prudent to review the associations between specific human genetic variants and clinical disease severity or susceptibility to infection that have been reported in the literature to date (at the time of writing this article in early August 2020 with updates in mid-September). With this work, we hope (i) to assist the fast-paced biomedical research efforts to combat the virus by critically summarizing current knowledge on the potential role of host genetics, and (ii) to help guide current genetics and genomics research towards candidate gene variants that warrant further investigation in larger studies. We found that determinants of differing severity of COVID-19 predominantly include components of the immune response to the virus, while determinants of differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 mostly entail genes related to the initial stages of infection (i.e., binding of the cell surface receptor and entry). Conclusion(s): Elucidating the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection would allow for the stratification of individuals according to risk so that those at high risk would be prioritized for immunization, for example, if or when safe and effective vaccines are developed. Our enhanced understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms could also guide personalized therapeutics. Such knowledge is already beginning to provide clues that help explain, at least in part, current epidemiologic observations regarding the typically more severe or benign disease course in older males and children, respectively.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, was first detected in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world. Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has been severe with more than half a million deaths over 6 months; in contrast, the HIV pandemic has resulted in over 32 million deaths worldwide over 40 years. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of COVID-19, summarizes its relationship to HIV, identifies synergies in our response, and suggests actions that can be taken to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious. Public health responses overlap between the two pandemics including the need for behavior change and containment strategies such as contact tracing. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, the path forward to controlling, preventing, and treating COVID-19 can be informed by lessons learned from HIV as we seek to control the spread of both viral pandemics.

0	Beyond dexamethasone, emerging immuno-thrombotic therapies for COVID-19. Host immunity is required to clear SARS-CoV-2, and inability to clear the virus because of host or pathogen factors renders those infected at risk of poor outcomes. Estimates of those who are able to clear the virus with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 remain unclear, and dependent on widespread testing. However, evidence is emerging that in severe cases, pathological mechanisms of hyperinflammation and coagulopathy ensue, the former supported by results from the RECOVERY trial demonstrating a reduction in mortality with dexamethasone in advanced COVID-19. It remains unclear whether these pathogenic pathways are secondary to a failure to clear the virus because of maladaptive immune responses or if these are sequential COVID-19 defining illnesses. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these cascades is essential to formulating rationale therapeutic approaches beyond the use of dexamethasone. Here, we review the pathophysiology thought to underlie COVID-19 with clinical correlates and the current therapeutic approaches being investigated.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: What is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible is SARS-CoV-2? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for viral infection? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, we performed a comparative study of four pathogenic viruses that primarily attack the respiratory system and may cause death, namely, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 strains). This comparative study provides a critical evaluation of the origin, genomic features, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, this evaluation may inform public health administrators and medical experts to aid in curbing the pandemic's progression.© Copyright © 2020 Abdelrahman, Li and Wang.	false
0	"The wide spectrum of Kawasaki-like disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Introduction: On June 2020, the first case of concurrent Covid-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) was published. After this first description, further works reported new cases of children affected by KD and KD-like syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical and biochemical features of these patients differed from the historical cohorts of KD, suggesting the possibility of a new multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome. Is still unclear if this new clinical entity, often referred as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), could be considered as part of the KD spectrum or is a new disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and uniquely linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors searched the available literature in MedLine (via Pubmed) with the terms (""coronaviruses"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""Kawasaki disease"") for English studies without any temporal limit. Areas covered: This review aims to comprehensively describe multisystem inflammatory syndromes affecting children during Coronaviruses outbreak, and to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of human Coronaviridae in KD and KD-like syndromes. Expert opinion: An increased incidence of PIMS-TS, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been reported, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a severe hyper-inflammatory syndrome in childhood. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are still unclear. Based on these findings, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered another trigger in the complex mosaic about the relationship among infectious agents and the occurrence of systemic hyper-inflammation related syndromes."	false

Objectives: To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and no criteria for hospitalisation. Trial design: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label controlled superiority trial. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:1 to the following strategies:Arm 1: Control armArms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial. Participant(s): Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale >=7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage >=B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations. Intervention and comparator: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalite), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. Main outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. Randomisation: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). Blinding (masking): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim ndegree3 and final) will be performed successively. Trial Status: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15th, 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15th, 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age >=65 replaced by age >=60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites. Trial registration: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22nd, 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10th, 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27).

0	Characteristics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections among ambulatory and hospitalized children and adolescents in an integrated health care system in Tennessee. Background Little is known regarding the full spectrum of illness among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection across ambulatory and inpatient settings. Methods Active surveillance was performed for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a quaternary care academic hospital laboratory in Tennessee from March 12-July 17, 2020. For symptomatic patients <=18 years of age, we performed phone follow-up and medical record review to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data on days 2, 7, and 30 after diagnosis and on day 30 for asymptomatic patients <=18 years. Daily and 7-day average test positivity frequencies were calculated for children and adults beginning April 26, 2020. Results SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 531/10327 (5.1%) specimens from patients <=18 years, including 46/5752 (0.8%) asymptomatic and 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic children. Cough (51%), fever (42%), and headache (41%) were the most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was uncommon (18/459 children; 4%); no children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period required intensive care unit admission. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 2 in 192/459 (42%), by day 7 in 332/459 (72%), and by day 30 in 373/396 (94%). The number of cases and percent positivity rose in late June and July in all ages. Conclusions In an integrated healthcare network, most pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were mild, brief, and rarely required hospital admission, despite increasing cases as community response measures were relaxed.	false
0	Genetic regulation of immune homeostatic lung leukocyte populations. Immune homeostasis is the state where the immune system maintains stability in the absence of insult. Much of the analysis of immune homeostasis has focused on systemic immunity, but it is also likely to be important in an organ specific manner. There is evidence that homeostatic immunity can affect subsequent responses to infection or vaccination. Since the lungs are a major site of infection, we used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic reference population to study the genetic regulation of the breadth of baseline immune cell populations in the lung and identify loci regulating these cells at the steady state. We found that all immune cell populations measured showed strong genetic (i.e. strain-specific) variation in cell type abundances. We identified 12 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in 12 immune cell populations or the relationships between cell populations. Given the role of various immune cells in the lungs during respiratory virus pathogenesis, we asked whether any of the mapped QTL correlated with influenza A virus (IAV) or Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease following infection in the same strains of mice. Notably, a locus we mapped for baseline abundance of CD8+ T cells in the lungs was associated with peak weight loss following IAV infection. Additionally, a locus mapped for variation in Ly6C+ monocyte/macrophage abundance was associated with SARS-CoV titer at days 2 and 4 post-infection. These data suggest that abundance of lung leukocyte populations prior to infection could serve as predictors of immune responses to respiratory viruses.	false
0	The COVID-19 pandemic through eyes of a NYC fertility center: a unique learning experience with often unexpected results. Affecting basic tenets of human existence such as health, economic as well as personal security and, of course, reproduction, the COVID-19 pandemic transcended medical specialties and professional disciplines. Yet, six months into the pandemic, there still exists no consensus on how to combat the virus in absence of a vaccine. Facing unprecedented circumstances, and in absence of real evidence on how to proceed, our organization early in the pandemic decided to act independently from often seemingly irrational guidance and, instead, to carefully follow a quickly evolving COVID-19 literature. Here described is the, likely, unique journey of a fertility center that maintained services during peaks of COVID-19 and political unrest that followed. Closely following publicly available data, we recognized relatively early that New York City and other East Coast regions, which during the initial COVID-19 wave between March and May represented the hardest-hit areas in the country, during the second wave, beginning in June and still in progress, remained almost completely unaffected. In contrast, south western regions, almost completely unaffected by the initial wave, were severely affected in the second wave. These two distinctively different infectious phenotypes suggested two likely explanations: The country was witnessing infections with two different SARS-CoV-2 viruses and NYC (along with the East Coast) acquired during the first wave much better immunity to the virus than south western regions. Both hypotheses since have been confirmed: East and West Coasts, indeed, were initially infected by two distinctively different lineages of the virus, with the East Coast lineage being 10-times more infectious. In addition, immunologists discovered an up to this point unknown long-term anti-viral innate (cellular) immune response which offers additional and much broader anti-viral immunity than the classical adaptive immunity via immobilizing antibodies that has been known for decades. Consequently, we predict that in the U.S., even in absence of an available vaccine, COVID-19, by September-October, will be at similarly low levels as are currently seen in NYC and other East Coast regions (generally < 1% test-positivity). We, furthermore, predict that, if current mitigation measures are maintained and no newly aggressive mutation of the virus enters the country, a significant fall-wave of COVID-19, in combination with the usual fall wave of influenza, appears unlikely. To continue serving patients uninterrupted throughout the pandemic, turned for all of our center's staff into a highly rewarding experience, garnered respect and appreciation from patients, and turned into an absolutely unique learning experience.	false
0	The Interaction of Natural and Vaccine-Induced Immunity with Social Distancing Predicts the Evolution of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The existence and nature of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are currently unknown; however, neutralizing antibodies are thought to play the major role and data from studying other coronaviruses suggest that partial clinical immunity lasting up to 1 year will occur postinfection. We show how immunity, depending on its durability, may work with current social practices to limit the spread of the virus. We further show that a vaccine that is 50% effective and taken by 50% of the population will prevent further loss of life, providing that social distancing is still practiced and that immunity does not wane quickly. IMPORTANCE The ability of our society to function effectively moving forward will depend on how the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is contained. Immunity to the virus will be critical to this equation. Copyright © 2020 Good and Hawkes.	false
0	A platform incorporating trimeric antigens into self-assembling nanoparticles reveals SARS-CoV-2-spike nanoparticles to elicit substantially higher neutralizing responses than spike alone. Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer-stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher-could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with 0.08 microg of SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticle elicited similar neutralizing responses as 2.0 microg of spike, which was ~ 25-fold higher on a weight-per-weight basis. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric viral antigens, with SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles inducing particularly potent neutralizing responses.	false
0	Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial. BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans. METHOD(S): We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18-80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18-59 years and >=60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 mug, 4 mug, or 8 mug on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18-59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 mug on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 mug on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459. FINDINGS: In phase 1, 192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53.7 years [SD 15.6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 mug [n=24], 4 mug [n=24], or 8 mug [n=24] for both age groups [18-59 years and >=60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18-59 years, one [4%] in the 2 mug group, one [4%] in the 4 mug group, and two [8%] in the 8 mug group; >=60 years, one [4%] in the 8 mug group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18-59 years (87.7 [95% CI 64.9-118.6], 2 mug group; 211.2 [158.9-280.6], 4 mug group; and 228.7 [186.1-281.1], 8 mug group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80.7 [65.4-99.6], 2 mug group; 131.5 [108.2-159.7], 4 mug group; and 170.87 [133.0-219.5], 8 mug group) compared with the placebo group (2.0 [2.0-2.0]). In phase 2, 448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41.7 years [SD 9.9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 mug on day 0 [n=84] or 4 mug on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 mug day 0; 18 [21%], 4 mug days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 mug days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 mug days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 mug days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 mug day 0; one [1%], 4 mug days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 mug days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 mug days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 mug days 0 and 14 (169.5, 95% CI 132.2-217.1), days 0 and 21 (282.7, 221.2-361.4), and days 0 and 28 (218.0, 181.8-261.3) schedules than the 8 mug day 0 schedule (14.7, 11.6-18.8; all p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 mug vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 mug dose or 4 mug dose on days 0 and 14.

0	BCG revaccination of health workers in Brazil to improve innate immune responses against COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Objectives: The BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiania (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. Trial design: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. Participant(s): The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiania - Goias, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. Intervention and comparator: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. Main outcomes: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. Randomisation: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. Blinding (masking): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated. Trial Status: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021. Trial registration: The protocol number was registered on August 5th, 2020 at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clinicos). Register number: RBR-4kjqtg and WHO trial registration number UTN: U1111-1256-3892.

0	Safety and Immunogenicity of Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States. METHOD(S): In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 mug, 20 mug, 30 mug, and 100 mug). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 mug of BNT162b1), participants received one dose. RESULT(S): A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples. CONCLUSION(S): The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2-3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

0	COVID-19 in Neonates: A Call for Standardized Testing. The limited evidence on neonatal coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact. Testing of neonates with perinatal or postnatal exposure to COVID-19 infection plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, management and institution of infection prevention measures thereby cutting off the chain of epidemic transmission. A recently concluded online neonatal COVID-19 conference conducted by the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India and a nationwide online survey pointed to substantial variation in neonatal testing strategies. We, herein, summarize the relevant literature about the incidence and outcomes of neonatal COVID-19 and call for a universal and uniform testing strategy for exposed neonates. We anticipate that the testing strategy put forth in this article will facilitate better management and safe infection prevention measures among all units offering neonatal care in the country.	false
0	Generation of Chicken IgY against SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein and Epitope Mapping. This new decade has started with a global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), precipitating a worldwide health crisis and economic downturn. Scientists and clinicians have been racing against time to find therapies for COVID-19. Repurposing approved drugs, developing vaccines and employing passive immunization are three major therapeutic approaches to fighting COVID-19. Chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY) has the potential to be used as neutralizing antibody against respiratory infections, and its advantages include high avidity, low risk of adverse immune responses, and easy local delivery by intranasal administration. In this study, we raised antibody against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in chickens and extracted IgY (called IgY-S) from egg yolk. IgY-S exhibited high immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 S, and by epitope mapping, we found five linear epitopes of IgY-S in SARS-CoV-2 S, two of which are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV S. Notably, epitope SIIAYTMSL, one of the identified epitopes, partially overlaps the S1/S2 cleavage region in SARS-CoV-2 S and is located on the surface of S trimer in 3D structure, close to the S1/S2 cleavage site. Thus, antibody binding at this location could physically block the access of proteolytic enzymes to S1/S2 cleavage site and thereby impede S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage, which is crucial to subsequent virus-cell membrane fusion and viral cell entry. Therefore, the feasibility of using IgY-S or epitope SIIAYTMS-specific IgY as neutralizing antibody for preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is worth exploring.

0	The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein as a drug and vaccine target: Structural insights into its complexes with ACE2 and antibodies. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has so far resulted in more than 1.1 M deaths and 40 M cases worldwide with no confirmed remedy yet available. Since the first outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, researchers across the globe have been in a race to develop therapies and vaccines against the disease. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other previously identified Coronaviridae family members, encodes several structural proteins, such as spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, that are responsible for host penetration, binding, recycling, and pathogenesis. Structural biology has been a key player in understanding the viral infection mechanism and in developing intervention strategies against the new coronavirus. The spike glycoprotein has drawn considerable attention as a means to block viral entry owing to its interactions with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor. Here, we review the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with ACE2 and antibodies. Structural information of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 and antibodies can provide key input for the development of therapies and vaccines against the new coronavirus.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	A SARS-CoV-2 variant with the 12-bp deletion at E gene. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing and has become an important public health threat. This disease is caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and so far, little is known about this virus. In this study, by using plaque purification, we purified two SARS-CoV-2 virus strains from the same specimen, one named F8 containing a 12-bp deletion in the E gene and the other named 8X containing the wild-type E gene. There was no significant difference in the viral titer and infectivity of these two strains. The S protein content of the F8 viral culture was 0.39 mug/ml, much higher than that of 8X. An inactivated vaccine made from the F8 strain could trigger high levels of the IgG titer and neutralizing antibody titer, which could last for at least 6 weeks and were significantly higher than those from the 8X strain at 1 and 3 weeks post vaccination, respectively. In conclusion, we reported that both the E gene mutant and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated from the same clinical sample by plaque purification. A 12-bp deletion in the E gene was important for SARS-CoV-2 replication and immunogenicity.	false
0	A computational study to disclose potential drugs and vaccine ensemble for COVID-19 conundrum. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-COV-2, a virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, is considered a potential candidate for the design of new drugs and vaccines. The protein is central to several critical events in virus production, with its highly druggable nature and rich antigenic determinants making it an excellent anti-viral biomolecule. Docking-based virtual screening using the Asinex anti-viral library identified binding of drug molecules at three specific positions: loop 1 region, loop 2 region and beta-sheet core pockets, the loop 2 region being the most common binding and stable site for the bulk of the molecules. In parallel, the protein was characterized by vaccine design perspective and harboured three potential B cell-derived T cell epitopes: PINTNSSPD, GVPINTNSS, and DHIGTRNPA. The epitopes are highly antigenic, virulent, non-allergic, non-toxic, bind with good affinity to the highly prevalent DRB*0101 allele and show an average population coverage of 95.04%. A multi-epitope vaccine ensemble which was 83 amino acids long was created. This was highly immunogenic, robust in generating both humoral and cellular immune responses, thermally stable, and had good physicochemical properties that could be easily analyzed in in vivo and in vitro studies. Conformational dynamics of both drug and vaccine ensemble with respect to the receptors are energetically stable, shedding light on favourable conformation and chemical interactions. These facts were validated by subjecting the complexes to relative and absolute binding free energy methods of MMGB/PBSA and WaterSwap. A strong agreement on the system stability was disclosed that supported ligand high affinity potential for the receptors. Collectively, this work sought to provide preliminary experimental data of existing anti-viral drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19 infections and a new peptide-based vaccine for protection against this pandemic virus.

0	N-terminally truncated nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a better serological marker than whole nucleocapsid protein in evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a serious public health crisis, and no specific treatments or vaccines are available yet. A nucleocapsid protein (NP)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection method is not only important in disease diagnosis, but is required for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy during the development of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we expressed both the NP and N-terminally truncated NP (DELTAN-NP) of SARS-CoV-2 in an Escherichia coli expression system and described the purification of the soluble recombinant NP and DELTAN-NP in details. The identities of the NP and DELTAN-NP were confirmed with mass spectrometry. We then used immunoglobulin G detection ELISAs to compare the sensitivity of NP and DELTAN-NP in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DELTAN-NP showed greater sensitivity than NP in the analysis of serially diluted sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with inactive SARS-CoV-2 and in human sera diluted 1:400. DELTAN-NP showed a positive detection rate similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in human sera. We conclude that DELTAN-NP is a better serological marker than NP for evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"Is ""no test is better than a bad test""? Impact of diagnostic uncertainty in mass testing on the spread of COVID-19. Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle epidemics. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus."	false
0	Critical complications of COVID-19: A descriptive meta-analysis study. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus infection that has rapidly spread worldwide, causing a pandemic. The main objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of the most common symptoms and complications of COVID-19. All relevant studies on the clinical complications of COVID-19 have been identified by searching two web databases (i.e., PubMed and Scopus). Afterward, the relevant data were extracted from the selected studies, and then analyzed by the STATA (Version 14) random-effects model. The 30 studies selected for our meta-analysis covered 6,389 infected patients. The prevalence rates of the most common symptoms were as follows: fever: 84.30% (95% CI: 77.13-90.37; I2 = 97.74%), cough: 63.01% (95% CI: 57.63-68.23; I2 = 93.73%), dyspnea: 37.16% (95% CI: 27.31-47.57%; I2 = 98.32%), fatigue: 34.22% (95% CI: 26.29-42.62; I2 = 97.29%), and diarrhea: 11.47% (95% CI: 6.96-16.87; I2 = 95.58%). Moreover, the most prevalent complications were found to be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with 33.15% (95% CI: 23.35-43.73; I2 = 98.56%), arrhythmia with 16.64% (95% CI: 9.34-25.5; I2 = 92.29%), acute cardiac injury with 15.68% (95% CI: 11.1-20.97; I2 = 92.45%), heart failure with 11.50% (95% CI: 3.45-22.83; I2 = 89.48%), and acute kidney injury (AKI) with 9.87% (95% CI: 6.18-14.25; I2 = 95.64%). In this study, we assessed the prevalence of the main clinical complications of COVID-19, and found that following respiratory complications, cardiac and renal complications are the most common clinical complications of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Vakili et al.

0	Testing of asymptomatic individuals for fast feedback-control of COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of a priori non-symptomatic but infectious humans (either by random or cohort testing) significantly improves the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to intervention strategies relying on data from symptomatic cases only. This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feedback is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to Anderson-localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.	false
0	Systematic Review on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: It Is Time to Take Stock. Background & Aims: Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes. Conclusion(s): Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute	false
0	Possible vertical transmission and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mothers with COVID-19: A living systematic review. Current evidence suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is predominantly transmitted from human-to-human. However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/ MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95%CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, 6 studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/ M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95%CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49AU/mL (range: 7.25AU/mL-140.32AU/mL) and 3.79AU/mL (range: 0.16AU/mL-45.83AU/mL), p = 0.0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

0	The mental health of healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review. Purpose: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is widely spreading all over the world, causing mental health problems for most people. The medical staff is also under considerable psychological pressure. This study aimed to review all research carried out on the mental health status of health care workers (HCWs) to bring policymakers and managers' attention. Method(s): A literature search conducted through e-databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) from December 2019 up to April 12th 2020. All cross- sectional studies published in English which assessed the health workers' psychological well-being during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included. Study quality was analyzed using NHLBI Study Quality assessment tools. Result(s): One hundred relevant articles were identified through systematic search; of which eleven studies were eligible for this review. Their quality score was acceptable. The lowest reported prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among HCWs was 24.1%, 12.1%, and 29.8%, respectively. In addition, the highest reported values for the aforementioned parameters were 67.55%, 55.89%, and 62.99%, respectively. Nurses, female workers, front-line health care workers, younger medical staff, and workers in areas with higher infection rates reported more severe degrees of all psychological symptoms than other health care workers. Moreover, vicarious traumatization in non-front-line nurses and the general public was higher than that of the front-line nurses. Conclusion(s): During SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the health care workers face aggravated psychological pressure and even mental illness. It would be recommended to the policymakers and managers to adopt the supportive, encouragement & motivational, protective, and training & educational interventions, especially through information and communication platform.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Obesity aggravates COVID-19: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. AIMS: This review aimed to evaluate the impact of obesity on the onset, exacerbation, and mortality of COVID-19; and compare the effects of different degrees of obesity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to find articles published between December 1, 2019, and July 27, 2020. Only observational studies with specific obesity definition were included. Literature screening and data extraction were conducted simultaneously by two researchers. Random-effects model was used to merge the effect quantity. Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were used to deal with the heterogeneity among studies., RESULTS: Forty-one studies with 219543 subjects and 115635 COVID-19 patients were included. Subjects with obesity were more likely to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.37-1.63, I2 = 69.2%); COVID-19 patients with obesity had a higher incidence of hospitalization (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.33-1.78, I2 = 60.9%); Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with obesity had a higher incidence of ICU admission (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.24-1.77, I2 = 67.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.31-1.65, I2 = 18.8%), and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.26, I2 = 74.4%). A higher degree of obesity also indicated a higher risk of almost all the above events. Region may be one of the causes of heterogeneity., CONCLUSIONS: Obesity could promote the occurrence of the whole course of COVID-19. A higher degree of obesity may predict a higher risk. Further basic and clinical therapeutic researches need to be strengthened. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Sleep problems during COVID-19 pandemic by population: a systematic review and meta-analysis. STUDY OBJECTIVES: No systematic review or meta-analysis has yet been conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of sleep problems among the general population, healthcare workers, or COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to assess the impact and prevalence of sleep problems among those categories., METHODS: APA PsycINFO; Cochrane; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); EBSCOhost; EMBASE; Google Scholar; MEDLINE; ProQuest Medical; ScienceDirect; Scopus; and Web of Science from 01 November 2019 to 05 July 2020. Additionally, four preprints servers (medRxiv.org; Preprints.org; psyarxiv.com; arXiv.org; biorxiv.org) were also searched for papers accepted after peer-review but not yet published and indexed. There was no language restriction. The random-effect models meta-analysis model were used with the DerSimonian and Laird methodology., RESULTS: Forty-four papers, involving a total of 54,231 participants from 13 countries, were judged relevant and contributed to the systematic review and meta-analysis of sleep problems during COVID-19. The global pooled prevalence rate of sleep problems among all populations was 35.7% [95%CI 29.4-42.4%]. COVID-19 patients appeared to be the most affected group, with a pooled rate of 74.8% [95%CI 28.7-95.6%]. Healthcare workers and the general population had comparative rates of sleep problems with rates of 36.0% [95%CI 21.1-54.2%] and 32.3% [95%CI 25.3-40.2%], respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic is high and approximately affect 40% of people from the general and healthcare populations. COVID-19 active patients appeared to have higher prevalence rates of sleep problems. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.	false
0	State-wise prevalence of COVID 19 in India by using machine learning approaches. Coronavirus is one of the world's most critical issues, till date. Comprehension of causative variables such as mellitus, heart-related issues, asthma, blood pressure, etc., including the intrinsic transmission mechanisms of the disease, COVID 19 and its eradication are important for neurological investigation. Hence, the advance of appropriate modeling approaches and methods applied to current corona information on the pervasiveness of the pandemic and other serious illness aspects, is taking consideration. The prevalence of COVID 19 in India has reached epidemic proportions, and this disease is becoming a significantly increasing case in India. In this work, polynomial regression analysis methods employ to to forecast the number of COVID 19 corona patients. In this, we described a decision tree, polynomial and random forest classification of disease in COVID 19 incidences modelling and forecasting in India and a predicted prevalence of high level of confidence.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Protection against SARS-CoV-2 by BCG vaccination is not supported by epidemiological analyses. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases. BCG vaccination has recently been proposed as a strategy to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, supported by its potential to boost innate immunity and initial epidemiological analyses which observed reduced severity of COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccination policies. Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our epidemiological findings do not provide evidence to correlate overall BCG vaccination policy with the spread of CoV-2 and its associated mortality.	false
0	Factors Associated With US Adults' Likelihood of Accepting COVID-19 Vaccination. Importance: The development of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has progressed at unprecedented speed. Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. Objective(s): To examine the factors associated with survey participants' self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. Result(s): A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10000 to 1 in 1000000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: -0.13 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.11]; UK: -0.04 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.	false
0	A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders in Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background There is not enough evidence to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health disorders among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: In the present systematic review, a search process was conducted to screen the databases of ProQuest, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and MEDLINE for the relevant articles published between 2019 and 2020. The quality of the articles was assessed by the STROBE checklist. Results: From the relevant studies, 15 were selected for review. The results showed the prevalence of anxiety was between 3.8 to 17.5% in Asian countries, with the lowest in Iran (3.8%) and the highest in Sri Lanka (17.5 %). The prevalence of anxiety was from 23.9 to 72% in Western countries, with the lowest in the USA (23%) and the highest in Canada (72%). In two of the studies in China, the prevalence of anxiety was from 3.09 to 29.6% and of depression from 5.2 to 40%. The incidence rate of self-harm thoughts as a result of the epidemic was significantly high (RR=2.85, 95% CI= 1.70, 8.85, P=0.005). Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety was from 3.8 to 17.5% in Asian countries and from 23.9 to 72% in Western countries. The prevalence of depression was from 5.2 to 40%. Moderate levels of anxiety and depression were reported in Western countries compared with Asian countries. Depression and anxiety should be regularly screened in obstetrics and gynecology wards following the current epidemic to ensure optimal mental health during pregnancy and infancy.	false

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally to most countries. In Japan, the first COVID-19 patient was identified on January 15, 2020. By June 30, the total number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 reached 18,000. The impact of molecular detection of pathogens is significant in acute-care settings where rapid and accurate diagnostic measures are critical for decisions in patient treatment and outcomes of infectious diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), are the most established gene amplification tools and have a comprehensive range of clinical applications, including detecting a variety of pathogens, even novel agents causing emerging infections. Because SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded RNA genome, reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) has been broadly employed for rapid and sensitive quantitative measurements of viral RNA copy numbers. The RT-qPCR method, however, still requires time-consuming reactions with two different enzymes in addition to isolation of RNA from patient samples, limiting the numbers of testing institutions for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Japan is known to have performed a relatively small number of PCR tests as well as confirmed cases among developed nations; as of June 30, 2020, approximately 390,000 people in Japan had undergone PCR tests. Given the devastating impact on medical services and the scale of demand for diagnostic testing of COVID-19, it has been proposed that academic settings such as basic research departments in university/college can be engaged in diagnosing, especially in university hospitals or academic medical centers. In collaboration with established diagnostic laboratories, academic facilities can divert their function to detecting virus from patients with suspected COVID-19, adopting existing specialized expertise in virus handling, molecular work, and data analysis. This in-house testing strategy facilitates the rapid diagnosing of thousands of samples per day and reduces sample turnaround time from 1 week to less than 24 h. This review provides an overview of the general principles, diagnostic value, and limitations of COVID-19 diagnosis platforms in Japan, in particular in-house testing at academic settings.	false

Conventional piglets were inoculated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through different routes, including intranasal, intratracheal, intramuscular and intravenous ones. Although piglets were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and lacked lesions or viral RNA in tissues/swabs, seroconversion was observed in pigs inoculated parenterally (intramuscularly or intravenously).Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Challenging Concerns of Transgender Community Amidst COVID-19. A 30-year-old transgender woman was admitted to the dedicated COVID hospital. She presented with mild symptoms and had various psychosocial insecurities, which remained unattended on reaching our health-care facility. From being left alone by her peers, lack of proper deliverance of information, and the stigma attached to the gender issues made her anxious and fearful. Although there are studies showing the prevalence of psychosocial burden in transgender people, a comprehensive approach led by a palliative care physician is yet to be initiated.

0	What Proportion of Patients with Bone and Soft-Tissue Tumors Contracted Coronavirus-19 and Died From Surgical Procedures During the Initial Period of the COVID-19 Pandemic? Results From the Multicenter British Orthopaedic Oncology Society Observational St. BACKGROUND: Delivering uninterrupted cancer treatment to patients with musculoskeletal tumors has been essential during the rapidly evolving coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as delays in management can be detrimental. Currently, the risk of contracting COVID-19 in hospitals when admitted for surgery and the susceptibility due to adjuvant therapies and associated mortality due to COVID-19 is unknown, but knowledge of these potential risks would help treating clinicians provide appropriate cancer care., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in patients with musculoskeletal tumors admitted for surgery during the initial period of the pandemic? (2) What is the associated mortality in patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have contracted COVID-19? (3) Are patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have had neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) preoperatively at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19? (4) Is a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade in patients with musculoskeletal tumors associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when admitted to the hospital for surgery?, METHODS: This retrospective, observational study analyzed patients with musculoskeletal tumors who underwent surgery in one of eight specialist centers in the United Kingdom, which included the five designated cancer centers in England, one specialist soft tissue sarcoma center, and two centers from Scotland between March 12, 2020 and May 20, 2020. A total of 347 patients were included, with a median (range) age of 53 years (10 to 94); 60% (207 of 347) were men, and the median ASA grade was II (I to IV). These patients had a median hospital stay of 8 days (0 to 53). Eighteen percent (61 of 347) of patients had received neoadjuvant therapy (8% [27] chemotherapy, 8% [28] radiation, 2% [6] chemotherapy and radiation) preoperatively. The decision to undergo surgery was made in adherence with United Kingdom National Health Service and national orthopaedic oncology guidelines, but specific data with regard to the number of patients within each category are not known. Fifty-nine percent (204 of 347) were negative in PCR testing done 48 hours before the surgical procedure; the remaining 41% (143 of 347) were treated before preoperative PCR testing was made mandatory, but these patients were asymptomatic. All patients were followed for 30 days postoperatively, and none were lost to follow-up during that period. The primary outcome of the study was contracting COVID-19 in the hospital after admission. The secondary outcome was associated mortality after contracting COVID-19 within 30 days of the surgical procedure. In addition, we assessed whether there is any association between ASA grade or neoadjuvant treatment and the chances of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Electronic patient record system and simple descriptive statistics were used to analyze both outcomes., RESULTS: Four percent (12 of 347) of patients contracted COVID-19 in the hospital, and 1% (4 of 347) of patients died because of COVID-19-related complications. Patients with musculoskeletal tumors who contracted COVID-19 had increased mortality compared with patients who were asymptomatic or tested negative (odds ratio 55.33 [95% CI 10.60 to 289.01]; p < 0.001). With the numbers we had, we could not show that adjuvant therapy had any association with contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital (OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.20 to 4.38]; p = 0.93). Increased ASA grade was associated with an increased likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (OR 58 [95% CI 5 to 626]; p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: Our results show that surgeons must be mindful and inform patients that those with musculoskeletal tumors are at risk of contracting COVID-19 while admitted to the hospital and some may succumb to it. Hospital administrators and governmental agencies should be aware that operations on patients with lower ASA grade appear to have lower risk and should consider restructuring service delivery to ensure that procedures are performed in designated COVID-19-restricted sites. These measures may reduce the likelihood of patients contracting the virus in the hospital, although we cannot confirm a benefit from this study. Future studies should seek to identify factors influencing these outcomes and also compare surgical complications in those patients with and without COVID-19., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.	false
0	Guillain-Barre syndrome and COVID-19: an observational multicentre study from two Italian hotspot regions. OBJECTIVE: Single cases and small series of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide. We evaluated incidence and clinical features of GBS in a cohort of patients from two regions of northern Italy with the highest number of patients with COVID-19., METHODS: GBS cases diagnosed in 12 referral hospitals from Lombardy and Veneto in March and April 2020 were retrospectively collected. As a control population, GBS diagnosed in March and April 2019 in the same hospitals were considered., RESULTS: Incidence of GBS in March and April 2020 was 0.202/100 000/month (estimated rate 2.43/100 000/year) vs 0.077/100 000/month (estimated rate 0.93/100 000/year) in the same months of 2019 with a 2.6-fold increase. Estimated incidence of GBS in COVID-19-positive patients was 47.9/100 000 and in the COVID-19-positive hospitalised patients was 236/100 000. COVID-19-positive patients with GBS, when compared with COVID-19-negative subjects, showed lower MRC sum score (26.3+/-18.3 vs 41.4+/-14.8, p=0.006), higher frequency of demyelinating subtype (76.6% vs 35.3%, p=0.011), more frequent low blood pressure (50% vs 11.8%, p=0.017) and higher rate of admission to intensive care unit (66.6% vs 17.6%, p=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an increased incidence of GBS during the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy, supporting a pathogenic link. COVID-19-associated GBS is predominantly demyelinating and seems to be more severe than non-COVID-19 GBS, although it is likely that in some patients the systemic impairment due to COVID-19 might have contributed to the severity of the whole clinical picture.

0	Decrease of mobility, electricity demand, and NO2 emissions on COVID-19 times and their feedback on prevention measures. The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 2020 has affected human activities in a way never documented in modern history. As a consequence of the prevention measures implemented to contain the virus, cities around the world are experiencing a decrease in urban mobility and electricity demand that have positively affected the air quality. The most extreme cases for cities around the world show a decrease of 90, 40, and 70% in mobility, electricity demand, and NO2 emissions respectively. At the same time, the inspection of these changes along the evaluation of COVID-19 incidence curves allow to obtain feedback about the timely execution of prevention measures for this and future global events. In this case, we identify and discuss the early effort of Latin-American countries to successfully delay the spread of the virus by implementing prevention measures before the fast growth of COVID-19 cases in comparison to European countries.

0	COVID-19 and myositis - unique challenges for patients. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent effects on healthcare systems is having a significant effect on the management of long-term autoimmune conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the problems faced by patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)., METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was carried out with a focus on effects on disease control, continuity of medical care, drug procurance and prevalent fears in the patient population., RESULTS: Of the 608 participants (81.1% female, median (s.d.) age 57 (13.9) years), dermatomyositis was the most frequent subtype (247, 40.6%). Patients reported health-related problems attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 195, 32.1%); specifically 102 (52.3%) required increase in medicines, and 35 (18%) required hospitalization for disease-related complications. Over half (52.7%) of the surveyed patients were receiving glucocorticoids and/or had underlying cardiovascular risk factors (53.8%), placing them at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Almost one in four patients faced hurdles in procuring medicines. Physiotherapy, critical in the management of IIM, was disrupted in 214 (35.2%). One quarter (159, 26.1%) experienced difficulty in contacting their specialist, and 30 (4.9%) were unable to do so. Most (69.6%) were supportive of the increased use of remote consultations to maintain continuity of medical care during the pandemic., CONCLUSION: This large descriptive study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has incurred a detrimental effect on continuity of medical care for many patients with IIM. There is concern that delays and omissions in clinical care may potentially translate to poorer outcomes in the future. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	COVID-19 in Dialysis Patients: Outlasting and Outsmarting a Pandemic. COVID-19 has affected dialysis patients and dialysis patient care worldwide. In this issue of Kidney International, three reports highlight the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients, noting its high prevalence, particularly among in-center dialysis patients. This likely reflects patients' limited ability to physically distance as well as community exposures, including residence in areas with high rates of infection. Dialysis patients are at extremely high risk should they develop COVID-19, with short-term mortality of 20% or higher. Accordingly, it is imperative that the kidney community intervene to reduce the threat of COVID-19 in the vulnerable population by focusing on modifiable factors, including universal masking of patients and staff and enhanced screening, including testing asymptomatic patients for COVID-19 in times of high local prevalence.Copyright © 2020.

0	Stretching and break-up of saliva filaments during speech: A route for pathogen aerosolization and its potential mitigation. Speech is a potent route for viral transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic. Informed mitigation strategies are difficult to develop since no aerosolization mechanism has been visualized yet in the oral cavity. Here we show with high-speed imaging how phonation of common stop consonants, found in most of the world's spoken languages, form and extend salivary filaments in a few milliseconds as moist lips open or when the tongue separates from the teeth. Both saliva viscoelasticity and airflow associated with the plosion of stop consonants are essential for stabilizing and subsequently forming centimeter-scale thin filaments, tens of microns in diameter, that break into speech droplets. Moreover, these plosive consonants induce vortex rings that drive meter-long transport of exhaled air, tying this mechanism to transport associated with speech. We demonstrate that a similar mechanism of aerosolization occurs during the vibration of reeds in wind instruments and may occur during the flapping of the glottis folds. Finally, our research suggests a mitigation of droplet production during speech by using a lip balm.	false
0	Etiology of fever in returning travelers and migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Numerous publications focus on fever in returning travelers, but there is no known systematic review considering all diseases, or all tropical diseases causing fever. Such a review is necessary in order to develop appropriate practice guidelines., OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives of this review were i) to determine the etiology of fever in travelers/migrants returning from (sub) tropical countries as well as the proportion of patients with specific diagnoses, and ii) to assess the predictors for specific tropical diseases., METHOD: Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched with terms combining fever AND travel/migrants. All studies focusing on causes of fever in returning travelers and/or clinical and laboratory predictors of tropical diseases were included. Meta-analyses were performed on frequencies of etiological diagnoses., RESULTS: 10064 studies were identified; 541 underwent full-text review; 30 met criteria for data extraction. Tropical infections accounted for 33% of fever diagnoses, with malaria causing 22%, dengue 5% and enteric fever 2%. Non-tropical infections accounted for 36% of febrile cases, with acute gastroenteritis causing 14% and respiratory tract infections 13%. Positive likelihood ratios demonstrated that splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia were respectively 5-14, 3-11 and 5-7 times more likely in malaria than non-malaria patients. High variability of results between studies reflects heterogeneity in study design, regions visited, participants' characteristics, setting, laboratory investigations performed, and diseases included., CONCLUSION: Malaria accounted for one fifth of febrile cases, highlighting the importance of rapid malaria testing in febrile returning travelers, followed by other rapid tests for common tropical diseases. High variability between studies highlights the need to harmonize study designs and to promote multi-center studies investigating predictors of diseases, including of lower incidence, which may help to develop evidence-based guidelines. The use of clinical decision support algorithms by health workers which incorporate clinical predictors, could help standardize studies as well as improve quality of recommendations.

0	Impact of Protein Corona on Noncovalent Molecule-Gold Nanoparticle-Based Sensing. Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based sensors have been extensively applied for sensing or imaging. It is known that a protein shell named protein corona (PC) formed around the nanomaterials could not only block the desired function of nanomaterials but also affect their behavior, which is a hot and important issue needing consideration. Therefore, we hypothesize that the formation of PC around AuNPs could inevitably affect the AuNP-based target assay. In this work, the effects of PC on the detection results in sensors based on AuNPs were studied. Three types of noncovalent molecule-AuNP sensors including AuNP-dichlorofluorescein, AuNP-aptamer, and AuNP-antibody-DNA were constructed, and several typical proteins (bovine serum albumin, fibrinogen, hemoglobin, and beta-lactoglobulin), milk, and fetal bovine serum were selected as models for the formation of PCs. This study shows that the PC could cause the loss of detection signals (up to 80%) and result in positive deviation of the measuring value compared with the true value. Moreover, the loss of detection signals could also increase the limits of detection (almost 10 times), decreasing the sensitivity of the three types of sensors, as proposed in this work compared to that without PC. Moreover, the polyethylene glycol backfilling strategy could not resolve the negative effects of PC on noncovalent molecule-AuNP sensors. The impacts of PC on detection results from noncovalent molecule-AuNP sensors would cause misdiagnosis or wasted production, which needs careful reconsideration of the AuNP-based detection in application fields like clinic diagnosis, food safety control, and so forth.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 presence in the saliva, tears and cerumen of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: The emergence of a new coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 from China led to a global pandemic. The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: The study included 38 COVID-19 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples. Saliva, tear and cerumen samples were taken from the patients within 72 hours of the first RT-PCR test. SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 gene regions were studied with single-step RT-PCR in all samples., RESULTS: Among the studied samples, the highest positivity rate was in saliva (76.3%) followed by tears (55.3%) and cerumen (39.5%). Viral load in saliva was also significantly higher compared to tears and cerumen (p<0.001), while there was no significant difference between tears and cerumen. Higher viral load in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples was associated with higher viral load in tears, but not in saliva or cerumen. Half of the saliva, tear and cerumen samples obtained from asymptomatic patients contained SARS-CoV-2 genome., CONCLUSION: The virus was detected in the saliva, tears and cerumen samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The potential role of these bodily fluids on viral spread needs to be studied. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Contextualizing cardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Acute cardiac injury incidence in COVID-19 is about 13 times higher in the ICU/severely ill than in less critical patients. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities seem to be more prone to develop higher acuity of the infection, and myocardial injury has been reported amongst them in up to 15% of those hospitalized and up to 30% of ICU-admitted ones. The symptoms of over ischemia/heart failure may be challenging to distinguish as dyspnoea and chest discomfort overlap with those due to COVID-19. Therefore, beside close monitoring with ECG, biomarkes and, in case of demonstrated cardiac involvement, echocardiography, strategies to improve myocardial oxygen delivery should be promptly applied. The cytokine release with complement and iNO dysregulation are established mechanisms potentially leading to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, making sepsis per se one of the potential mechanism leading to acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the hyper-inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is likely be responsible of both pulmonary in-situ platelet aggregation and deep thrombosis potentially leading to severe pulmonary embolism and right ventricular failure. Besides the customary antithrombotic prophylaxis for critical patients, D-dimer levels and tighter coagulation monitoring are recommended and should guide the choice for anticoagulation treatment. We summarize the current knowledge regarding cardiovascular involvement in patient with COVID-19.	false
0	Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Echo-Estimated Right and Left Heart Filling Pressures in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. Objectives: The prevalence of elevated right and left heart filling pressures in coronavirus disease 2019 is not well characterized. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and concurrent elevated left heart filling pressure in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 patients has evidence of pulmonary hypertension associated with elevated left heart filling pressure on transthoracic echocardiography., Design: Retrospective cohort study., Setting: Academic tertiary-care center., Patients: Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent clinical transthoracic echocardiography., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: The exposure variable of interest was right ventricular systolic pressure, calculated using the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as right ventricular systolic pressure greater than 40 mm Hg. Left heart filling pressure was estimated with Nagueh's method for pulmonary artery occlusion pressure using E/e' ratio, and normal was considered pulmonary artery occlusion pressure less than 16 mm Hg. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between the patients with and without pulmonary hypertension. A total of 73 patients (median age 66 yr [57-75 yr]; 46% women) were included. Median right ventricular systolic pressure was 39 mm Hg (interquartile range, 32-50 mm Hg), and 36 patients (49.3%) had evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to require ICU admission (86% vs 65%; p = 0.035) and have acute respiratory distress syndrome (72% vs 49%; p = 0.0053) than those without. In-hospital mortality was 26% for those with pulmonary hypertension compared with 14% for those without (p = 0.19). Patients with pulmonary hypertension had higher median-estimated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (17.4 mm Hg [12.7-21.3 mm Hg] vs 12.1 mm Hg [10.0-14.1 mm Hg]; p = 0.0008), and elevated left heart filling pressure was present in 59% of those with pulmonary hypertension., Conclusions: Pulmonary hypertension is common in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Left ventricular filling pressure is elevated in over half of those with pulmonary hypertension and may represent a target to reduce right ventricular afterload and potentially improve outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019.

0	Assessing COVID-19 risk, vulnerability and infection prevalence in communities. BACKGROUND: The spread of coronavirus in the United States with nearly five and half million confirmed cases and over 170,000 deaths has strained public health and health care systems. While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19., METHODS: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19., ANALYSIS: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses., RESULTS: All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<rho<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level. Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County's population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk., CONCLUSION: Policymakers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.	false
0	Echocardiographic abnormalities and predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: the ECHOVID-19 study. Aims: The present study had two aims: (i) compare echocardiographic parameters in COVID-19 patients with matched controls and (2) assess the prognostic value of measures of left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in relation to COVID-19 related death. Methods and Results: In this prospective multicentre cohort study, 214 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent an echocardiographic examination (by pre-determined research protocol). All participants were successfully matched 1:1 with controls from the general population on age, sex, and hypertension. Mean age of the study sample was 69 years, and 55% were male participants. LV and RV systolic function was significantly reduced in COVID-19 cases as assessed by global longitudinal strain (GLS) (16.4% +/- 4.3 vs. 18.5% +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (2.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001), and RV strain (19.8 +/- 5.9 vs. 24.2 +/- 6.5, P = 0.004). All parameters remained significantly reduced after adjusting for important cardiac risk factors. During follow-up (median: 40 days), 25 COVID-19 cases died. In multivariable Cox regression reduced TAPSE [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.07-1.31], P = 0.002, per 1 mm decrease], RV strain (HR = 1.64, 95%CI[1.02;2.66], P = 0.043, per 1% decrease) and GLS (HR = 1.20, 95%CI[1.07-1.35], P = 0.002, per 1% decrease) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death. TAPSE and GLS remained significantly associated with the outcome after restricting the analysis to patients without prevalent heart disease. Conclusion(s): RV and LV function are significantly impaired in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with matched controls. Furthermore, reduced TAPSE and GLS are independently associated with COVID-19-related death.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Access to Care During a Pandemic: Improving Planning Efforts to Incorporate Community Primary Care Practices and Public Health Stakeholders. An effective community response during a pandemic requires public health infrastructure and capacity, the availability of technology and supplies, a knowledgeable and prepared workforce, as well as an incident management and leadership plan. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, care providers were challenged by information gaps, supply shortages, and lack of resource coordination in caring for patients, which affected their ability to care for patients. As an emergency unfolds in a community, preemptive planning is needed to prevent barriers to quality patient care, support disease surveillance and contact tracing, and optimize the use of limited resources ranging from personal protective equipment to disease testing and hospital care. The experience of primary health-care providers during this pandemic provides useful information for understanding the gaps in emergency planning and management during a public health emergency.Copyright © 2020 Policy Studies Organization	false
0	Association of cardiac biomarkers and comorbidities with increased mortality, severity, and cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients: A meta-regression and decision tree analysis. Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has a deleterious effect on several systems, including the cardiovascular system. We aim to systematically explore the association of COVID-19 severity and mortality rate with the history of cardiovascular diseases and/or other comorbidities and cardiac injury laboratory markers. Method(s): The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to estimate pooled results from the 56 studies. The prognostic performance of cardiac markers for predicting adverse outcomes and to select the best cutoff threshold was estimated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining cardiac markers with demographic and clinical features was applied to predict mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19. Result(s): A meta-analysis of 17 794 patients showed patients with high cardiac troponin I (OR = 5.22, 95% CI = 3.73-7.31, P <.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 2.84-4.66, P <.001) were more likely to develop adverse outcomes. High troponin I more than 13.75 ng/L combined with either advanced age more than 60 years or elevated AST level more than 27.72 U/L was the best model to predict poor outcomes. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 severity and mortality are complicated by myocardial injury.

The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials-including for COVID-19-of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Nutritional Risk Screening Tools for Older Adults with COVID-19: A Systematic Review. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high risk of malnutrition, primarily in older people; assessing nutritional risk using appropriate screening tools is critical. This systematic review identified applicable tools and assessed their measurement properties. Literature was searched in the MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases. Four studies conducted in China met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes ranged from six to 182, and participants' ages from 65 to 87 years. Seven nutritional screening and assessment tools were used: the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), the MNA-short form (MNA-sf), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), the Geriatric NRI (GNRI), and modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score. Nutritional risk was identified in 27.5% to 100% of participants. The NRS-2002, MNA, MNA-sf, NRI, and MUST demonstrated high sensitivity; the MUST had better specificity. The MNA and MUST demonstrated better criterion validity. The MNA-sf demonstrated better predictive validity for poor appetite and weight loss; the NRS-2002 demonstrated better predictive validity for prolonged hospitalization. mNUTRIC score demonstrated good predictive validity for hospital mortality. Most instruments demonstrate high sensitivity for identifying nutritional risk, but none are acknowledged as the best for nutritional screening in older adults with COVID-19.	false
0	A mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic-SIIR model: Effects of asymptomatic individuals. A new mathematical model called SIIR model is constructed to describe the spread of infection by taking account of the characteristics of COVID-19 and is verified by the data from Japan. The following features of COVID-19: (a) there exist presymptomatic individuals who have infectivity even during the incubation period, (b) there exist asymptomatic individuals who can freely move around and play crucial roles in the spread of infection, and (c) the duration of immunity may be finite, are incorporated into the SIIR model. The SIIR model has the advantage of being able to explicitly handle asymptomatic individuals who are delayed in discovery or are extremely difficult to be discovered in the real world. It is shown that the conditions for herd immunity in the SIIR model become more severe than those in the SIR model; that is, the presence of asymptomatic individuals increases herd immunity threshold (HIT).	false
0	Vaccine development against coronavirus (2003 to present): An overview, recent advances, current scenario, opportunities and challenges. Background and aim: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/target sites for designing of vaccine against SARSCoV- 2 virus based on prior-art. (c) 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

0	Viral Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 over the preclinical, clinical, and postclinical period. BACKGROUND: It is necessary to know the viral kinetics and conduct epidemiologic investigations of confirmers to prevent the spread of the new infectious disease COVID-19 to the community. To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiologic link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19., RESULTS: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0-5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was lowest in clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred(Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more., CONCLUSION: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. Since there is very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in rheumatic patients and evaluation of the effect of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. One of the most controversial issues among rheumatologists is the best approach to managing a rheumatic patient (RP) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in RPs compared to the general population and to relatively assess the potential role of RPs' treatment regimen against COVID-19. In a cross-sectional study, all RPs with an updated medical record between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020, at the rheumatology clinic of Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Qom, Iran were included (as the case group), and the prevalence of COVID-19 was compared to the paired control group-individuals without RDs, randomly selected from the Qom Health Network's database. Qom was the first city in Iran in which COVID-19 was identified and spread rapidly. Both groups were paired regarding sex, age, and underlying severe conditions. The prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in RPs than the control group (p = 0.028). Moreover, patients who were under treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents seemed to possess a lower risk for COVID-19. Two RPs died from COVID-19, both of whom had granulomatosis and polyangiitis (GPA). The prevalence of COVID-19 in the RPs was lower than the control group, which could be associated with more adherence to the quarantine and social distancing rules by RPs and stricter routine follow-ups than the general population. Besides, taking DMARDs, such as leflunomide, might possess a protective effect against severe COVID-19, probably as a result of preventing cytokine storm.	false
0	Age-structured model for COVID-19: Effectiveness of social distancing and contact reduction in Kenya. Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Kenya reported its first case on March 13, 2020 and by March 16, 2020 she instituted physical distancing strategies to reduce transmission and flatten the epidemic curve. An age-structured compartmental model was developed to assess the impact of the strategies on COVID-19 severity and burden. Contacts between different ages are incorporated via contact matrices. Simulation results show that 45% reduction in contacts for 60-days period resulted to 11.5-13% reduction of infections severity and deaths, while for the 190-days period yielded 18.8-22.7% reduction. The peak of infections in the 60-days mitigation was higher and happened about 2 months after the relaxation of mitigation as compared to that of the 190-days mitigation, which happened a month after mitigations were relaxed. Low numbers of cases in children under 15 years was attributed to high number of asymptomatic cases. High numbers of cases are reported in the 15-29 years and 30-59 years age bands. Two mitigation periods, considered in the study, resulted to reductions in severe and critical cases, attack rates, hospital and ICU bed demands, as well as deaths, with the 190-days period giving higher reductions.

0	Prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The preventive and compulsory social isolation (ASPO by its acronym in Spanish) as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic flattened the contagion curve. However, its prolonged implementation could have a negative effect on the mental health of the population. The objective of our study was to observe this effect on the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression in a cardiovascular patients' sample and to associate the results with risk factors and/or coronary artery disease. On day 90 of ASPO, 3542 participants answered an electronic questionnaire that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. The average age of the sample was 60.2 +/- 14 years (54.7% women). The prevalence of anxiety was 13.5 % (n = 480), depression 16.7% (n = 592), and 44% of participants with depression had symptoms of anxiety (composite disorder). The female sex was more affected (anxiety 18.8% vs. 13.3% and depression 19.1% vs. 13.7%, p <0.0001). Both disorders were inversely associated with age, with participants = 40 years being more affected than those >= 71 years (anxiety 24.6% vs. 9%; depression 19.6% vs. 15.3%; p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis found no association with risk factors and/or cardiovascular disease. However, anxiety and depression were associated with risk behaviors: sedentary lifestyle, increased smoking and use of psychotropic drugs. In conclusion, the increase in the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression could be due to the prolonged implementation of ASPO. The age group of young adults (<= 40 years) was the one most affected.	false
0	Presurgical Screening of Asymptomatic Patients Undergoing Maxillofacial Surgery in the Wake of COVID-19 Pandemic. A novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), distinguished in Wuhan City at the end of December 2019, is producing a rapidly progressing health crisis in the world due to this number of patients are increasing and treating them is becoming a dilemma. Asymptomatic patient, COVID-19 can pose a problem and risk for both health care worker and other patients. Objective: To Identify Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients Coming For Maxillofacial Surgery and developing a management plan for these patients. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at a Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic in a Private setting of Lahore, From 1st March 2020 to 30 June 2020, for a period of 04 months. Total of 55 Patients were considered according to age, gender, trauma and pathology; patients were screened using PCR and chest xray. Patients were treated according to protocol proposed. Results: The mean age of patients was 33.41 +/- 11.34 years. There were 34 (61.81%) male patients and 21 (38.1%) female patient. Cause of admission was oral and maxillofacial trauma, oral cancer, orthognathic surgery and oroantral fistula. Among these 40(72.72 %) patient tested positive despite being asymptomatic, 15 (27.27 %) tested negative for COVID-19 PCR. Chest x-ray of 26(47.27%) patients shows mild changes while 29(52.57%) showed normal chest x-ray. Conclusion: Asymptomatic patient of COVID-19 pose a risk to high risk maxillofacial surgery procedures. Proper screening should be performed and proposed management plan should be followed to decrease transmission.	false
0	"Specificity and positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing in a low prevalence setting. OBJECTIVES: When SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is low, many positive test results are false positives. Confirmatory testing reduces overdiagnosis and nosocomial infection and enables real-world estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value. This study estimates these parameters to evaluate the impact of confirmatory testing, and to improve clinical diagnosis, epidemiological estimation and interpretation of vaccine trials. METHOD(S): Over one month, we took all respiratory samples from our laboratory with a patient's first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay or in-house RT-PCR platform), and repeated testing using two platforms. Samples were categorised by source, and by whether clinical details suggested COVID-19 or corroborative testing from another laboratory. We estimated specificity and positive predictive value using maximum likelihood-based approaches. RESULT(S): Of 19,597 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 107. 52 corresponded to first-time detection (0.27% of tests on samples without previous detection); further testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA >=1 time (""confirmed"") in 29 (56%), and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (""not confirmed"") in 23 (44%). Depending upon assumed parameters, point estimates for specificity and positive predictive value were 99.91%-99.98% and 61.8%-89.8% respectively using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 97.4%-99.1% and 20.1%-73.8% respectively using an in-house assay. CONCLUSION(S): Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 is highly specific. Nevertheless, when prevalence is low a significant proportion of initially positive results fail to confirm and confirmatory testing substantially reduces false positive detections. Omitting additional testing in samples with higher prior detection probabilities focuses testing where clinically impactful and minimises delay.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd."	false
0	Interleukin-6 receptor blockade with subcutaneous tocilizumab improves coagulation activity in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Many COVID-19 patients develop a hyperinflammatory response which activates blood coagulation and may contribute to the occurrence of thromboembolic complications. Blockade of interleukin-6, a key cytokine in COVID-19 pathogenesis, may improve the hypercoagulable state induced by inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor on coagulation parameters., METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed moderate to critical COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation, who received a single 324 mg subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab on top of standard of care were enrolled in this analysis. Coagulation parameters were measured before tocilizumab and at day 1, 3, and 7 after treatment. All patients were followed-up for 35 days after admission or until death., RESULTS: 70 patients (mean age 60 years, interquartile range 52-75) were included. Treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels (-56%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -68% to -44%), fibrinogen (-48%; 95%CI, -60% to -35%), C-reactive protein (-93%; 95%CI, -99% to -87%), prothrombin time (-4%; 95%CI,-9% to 0.8%), and activated thromboplastin time (-4%; 95%CI,-8.7% to 0.8%), and an increase in platelet count (34%; 95%CI, 23% to 45%). These changes occurred already one day after treatment with sustained reductions throughout day 7. The improvement in coagulation was consistently observed in patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose anticoagulants, and was paralleled by a rapid improvement in respiratory function., CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous tocilizumab was associated with significant improvement of blood coagulation parameters independently of thromboprophylaxis dose.

Symptom overlap between COVID-19 and lung cancer may complicate diagnostic evaluation. We aimed to investigate the incidence, symptoms, differential diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients., Methods: To determine an at-risk population for COVID-19, we retrospectively identified lung cancer patients receiving longitudinal care within a single institution in the 12 months (4/1/19 - 3/31/20) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, including an ""active therapy population"" treated within the last 60 days of this period. Among patients subsequently referred for COVID-19 testing, we compared symptoms, laboratory/radiographic findings, and outcomes of positive versus negative patients., Results: Between 4/1/2019-3/31/2020, 696 patients received longitudinal care, including 406 (58%) in the active therapy population. Among 55 patients referred for COVID-19 testing, 24 (44%) were COVID-19 positive, representing a cumulative incidence of 3.4% (longitudinal population) and 1.5% (active therapy population). Compared to COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a supplemental oxygen requirement (11% vs. 54%, p=0.005) and to have typical COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings (5 vs. 56%, p=0.001). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in presenting symptoms. Among COVID-negative patients, alternative etiologies included treatment-related toxicity (26%), atypical pneumonia (22%), and disease progression (22%). Sixteen COVID-19-postive patients (67%) required hospitalization, and 7 (29%) died from COVID-related complications., Conclusions: COVID-19 was infrequent in this lung cancer population, but these patients experienced high rates of morbidity and mortality. Oncologists should maintain a low threshold for COVID-19 testing in lung cancer patients presenting with acute symptoms. Copyright © 2020 The Authors."	false
0	Awareness of pandemic disease among rural population - A survey. The aim of the study is to create awareness on pandemic disease among rural populations. Pandemic is pathogens that are transmitted via direct contact between the susceptible and the infective populations. Respiratory infection disease such as influenza are a major public health issue best dealt with by preventive messages generally emphasise improved hand hygiene, face mask use by infected persons, and social distancing measures, including avoiding crowds during pandemic. In this survey 81.2% of the rural population were aware about pandemic diseases, 17.8% of the population not aware about pandemic diseases.78.2% of the population knew that coronavirus is pandemic diseases. 20.8% of the population did not know that coronavirus is a pandemic disease. 83.2% of the population were aware about coronavirus. 15.8% of the population were not aware about coronavirus. The present survey shows there is a less awareness of pandemic disease among the rural population. Therefore, awareness should be developed to spread knowledge in the rural population and especially to those who are more susceptible to become infected.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Incidence and risk factors of kidney impairment on patients with COVID-19: A meta-analysis of 10180 patients. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus is pandemic around the world. Several researchers have given the evidence of impacts of COVID-19 on the respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system. Studies still have debated on kidney injury of COVID-19 patients. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of kidney impairment with the development of COVID-19., METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and MedRxiv databases were searched until May 1, 2020. We extracted data from eligible studies to summarize the clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of kidney injury on COVID-19 infection patients and further compared the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mean differences of three biomarkers between in ICU/severe and non-ICU/non-severe cases. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method., RESULTS: In the sum of 24 studies with 10180 patients were included in this analysis. The pooled prevalence of AKI, increased serum creatinine (Scr), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased D-dimer, proteinuria and hematuria in patients with COVID-19 were 16.2%, 8.3%, 6.2%, 49.8%, 50.1% and 30.3% respectively. Moreover, the means of Scr, BUN and D-dimer were shown 6.4-folds, 1.8-folds and 0.67-folds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in corresponding non-ICU/non-severe patients. The prevalence of AKI was about 30 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/non-severe cases., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we assessed the incidences of the clinic and laboratory features of kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. And kidney dysfunction may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients developing into the severe condition. In reverse, COVID-19 can also cause damage to the kidney.	false
0	Prevalence and characteristics of Brazilians aged 50 and over that received a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over half a million deaths worldwide. Brazil has been particularly impacted, registering more than 1.3 million infections and 57,000 deaths by late June 2020. Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite the descriptive and preliminary nature of these findings, results reported here suggest the need for more targeted approaches to enhance personal protection and provide greater viral testing options, especially for older, sicker and more vulnerable adults in Brazil.	false
0	Fighting and chasing the rogue virus-covid19. The novel coronavirus of 2019, COVID-19, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread from its origin Wuhan,China to the rest of the world. It is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in China lately, they have increased exponentially in other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran. In India, the COVID-19 trajectory appears assured to change modes. While the number of incidents grew slowly in February, they doubled in just five days in mid-March from 100 to more than 236, and now at the end of April, the cases reported are 29,435. These numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing. . The Indian government declared a countrywide shutdown for a period of 3 weeks from 24th of March to help prevent the spread of the virus. Most of the affected people had connection with flyers from covid-19 affected countries; some of them had no such interaction, indicating that community transmission could have started in several parts of India. Thus, an important collective goal is to reduce the outbreak and to flatten the peak of the outbreak curve. Cooperation is a crucial tool in the COVID-19 battle. There is a need to identify and find a way around the particular threats, the overarching cultural and social patterns in our area. This article discusses the tactics that should build for handling the crisis.Copyright © 2020, J. K. Welfare and Pharmascope Foundation. All rights reserved.	false
0	[Six cases of acute pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19]. Rising from the province of Wuhan in China, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 broke out in winter 2019, causing a global pandemic. In most cases reported, COVID-19 symptoms include cough, dyspnea, myalgia and asthenia. In some cases, the disease can also cause severe respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to thromboembolic event such as pulmonary embolism. Moreover, there is an overlap between signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and COVID-19, which brings a challenge for the diagnosis and could potentially be fatal. Nevertheless, the incidence rate of pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19 is currently not known. In this paper we describe six cases of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19.	false
0	[Covid-19 and diabetes]. Diabetes is one of the most important comorbidities linked to the severity of infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The prevalence of diabetic patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two-to-threefold higher than that observed in non-diabetic patients and a risk of progressing to critical or fatal disease is increased by a factor of 3 to 4 in patients with diabetes. Multiple mechanisms link diabetes as a risk factor of severe COVID-19, including both diabetes-related (such as hyperglycaemia) and diabetes-associated (such as immune dysfunction, obesity and hypertension) components. Optimising glycaemic control to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 appears important but challenging and the best choice of antidiabetic treatment remains to be established, even if an early introduction of insulin in type 2 diabetes patients with COVID-19 is encouraged upon admission to the hospital. Future investigations are necessary to improve both the management and the prognosis in these very high risk patients.	false

0	Impact of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been associated with unfavourable pregnancy outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the human coronavirus family, and since this infection shows a pandemic trend it will involve many pregnant women., AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on maternal and neonatal outcomes., SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 8th May 2020. Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19., CONTENT: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70-100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1-20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72-94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0-6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates had a positive nasopharyngeal swab; one out of five neonates had elevated concentrations of serum IgM and IgG, but a negative swab., IMPLICATIONS: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, COVID-19 should not be considered as an indication for elective caesarean section. Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

0	Universal influenza vaccines: Shifting to better vaccines. Influenza virus causes acute upper and lower respiratory infections and is the most likely, among known pathogens, to cause a large epidemic in humans. Influenza virus mutates rapidly, enabling it to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Furthermore, influenza viruses can cross from animals to humans, generating novel, potentially pandemic strains. Currently available influenza vaccines induce a strain specific response and may be ineffective against new influenza viruses. The difficulty in predicting circulating strains has frequently resulted in mismatch between the annual vaccine and circulating viruses. Low-resource countries remain mostly unprotected against seasonal influenza and are particularly vulnerable to future pandemics, in part, because investments in vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling are concentrated in high-resource countries. Antibodies that target conserved sites in the hemagglutinin stalk have been isolated from humans and shown to confer protection in animal models, suggesting that broadly protective immunity may be possible. Several innovative influenza vaccine candidates are currently in preclinical or early clinical development. New technologies include adjuvants, synthetic peptides, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vectors, messenger RNA, viral vectors, and attenuated or inactivated influenza viruses. Other approaches target the conserved exposed epitope of the surface exposed membrane matrix protein M2e. Well-conserved influenza proteins, such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein, are mainly targeted for developing strong cross-protective T cell responses. With multiple vaccine candidates moving along the testing and development pipeline, the field is steadily moving toward a product that is more potent, durable, and broadly protective than previously licensed vaccines.Copyright © 2016 World Health Organization.	false
0	Ribosome display technology: Applications in disease diagnosis and control. Antibody ribosome display remains one of the most successful in vitro selection technologies for antibodies fifteen years after it was developed. The unique possibility of direct generation of whole proteins, particularly single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs), has facilitated the establishment of this technology as one of the foremost antibody production methods. Ribosome display has become a vital tool for efficient and low-cost production of antibodies for diagnostics due to its advantageous ability to screen large libraries and generate binders of high affinity. The remarkable flexibility of this method enables its applicability to various platforms. This review focuses on the applications of ribosome display technology in biomedical and agricultural fields in the generation of recombinant scFvs for disease diagnostics and control.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Prevalence, incidence, and outcomes across cardiovascular diseases in homeless individuals using national linked electronic health records. AIMS: The risk and burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are higher in homeless than in housed individuals but population-based analyses are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, incidence and outcomes across a range of specific CVDs among homeless individuals., METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linked UK primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and validated phenotypes, we identified homeless individuals aged >=16 years between 1998 and 2019, and age- and sex-matched housed controls in a 1:5 ratio. For 12 CVDs (stable angina; unstable angina; myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; unheralded coronary death; heart failure; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm), we estimated prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality post-diagnosis, comparing homeless and housed groups. We identified 8492 homeless individuals (32 134 matched housed individuals). Comorbidities and risk factors were more prevalent in homeless people, e.g. smoking: 78.1% vs. 48.3% and atrial fibrillation: 9.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001. CVD prevalence (11.6% vs. 6.5%), incidence (14.7 vs. 8.1 per 1000 person-years), and 1-year mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.08, P < 0.001] were higher, and onset was earlier (difference 4.6, 95% CI 2.8-6.3 years, P < 0.001), in homeless, compared with housed people. Homeless individuals had higher CVD incidence in all three arterial territories than housed people., CONCLUSION: CVD in homeless individuals has high prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality risk post-diagnosis with earlier onset, and high burden of risk factors. Inclusion health and social care strategies should reflect this high preventable and treatable burden, which is increasingly important in the current COVID-19 context. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Oropharyngeal candidiasis in hospitalised COVID-19 patients from Iran: Species identification and antifungal susceptibility pattern. Background: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major healthcare threat. Apparently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is armed by special abilities to spread and dysregulate the immune mechanisms. The likelihood of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) development in COVID-19 patients with a list of attributable risk factors for oral infections has not yet been investigated. Objective(s): We here aim to investigate the prevalence, causative agents and antifungal susceptibility pattern of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: A total of 53 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with OPC were studied. Relevant clinical data were mined. Strain identification was performed by 21-plex PCR and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Antifungal susceptibility testing to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin was performed according to the CLSI broth dilution method. Result(s): In 53 COVID-19 patients with OPC, cardiovascular diseases (52.83%) and diabetes (37.7%) were the principal underlying conditions. The most common risk factor was lymphopaenia (71%). In total, 65 Candida isolates causing OPC were recovered. C albicans (70.7%) was the most common, followed by C glabrata (10.7%), C dubliniensis (9.2%), C parapsilosis sensu stricto (4.6%), C tropicalis (3%) and Pichia kudriavzevii (=C krusei, 1.5%). Majority of the Candida isolates were susceptible to all three classes of antifungal drugs. Conclusion(s): Our data clarified some concerns regarding the occurrence of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients. Further studies should be conducted to design an appropriate prophylaxis programme and improve management of OPC in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH	false
0	High HIV prevalence in an early cohort of hospital admissions with COVID-19 in Cape Town, South Africa. Background. South Africa (SA) has a high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis. Cape Town was the SA metropole most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early observational data from Africa may provide valuable insight into what can be expected as the pandemic expands across the continent. Objectives. To describe the prevalence, clinical features, comorbidities and outcome of an early cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted with COVID-19. Methods. This was a descriptive observational study of an early cohort of adults with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted from 25 March to 11 May 2020. Results. Of 116 patients (mean age 48 years, 61% female) admitted, 24 were HIV-positive (21%). The most common symptoms reported were cough (n=88; 73%), shortness of breath (n=78; 69%), fever (n=67; 59%), myalgia (n=29; 25%) and chest pain (n=22; 20%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=46; 41%), diabetes mellitus (n=43; 38%), obesity (n=32; 28%) and HIV (n=24; 21%). Mortality was associated with older age (mean (standard deviation) 55 (12) years v. 46 (14) years; p<0.01); the presence of hypertension or hypertension along with diabetes and/or obesity; lower partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; and higher urea level, white cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. The overall survival rate for all hospital admissions was 86/116 (73%). In this early cohort, survival was similar in patients with HIV (n=18; 75%) compared with those without HIV (n=67; 75%) (p=1). Of the 74 patients admitted to the wards, 63 (85%) survived, whereas 22 of 42 (52%) admitted to the intensive care unit survived. Conclusions. Patients with HIV infection represented a large proportion of all COVID-19 admissions. The presentation and outcome of patients with HIV did not differ significantly from those of patients without HIV.	false

0	Endothelial barrier integrity in COVID-19-dependent hyperinflammation: Does the protective facet of platelet function matter?. The characteristic feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19 disease) is that its course is asymptomatic or mild in the majority of cases, while increasing age and/or underlying cardiovascular diseases predispose for a severalfold increased case fatality rate.1 This association has not been explained as yet, and several potential mechanisms have been put forward to uncover why the course of the disease is more severe in elderly patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors and/or cardiovascular diseases. Some hypotheses have been proposed, including the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2), accelerated ageing of the immune system, or other mechanisms linked to comorbidities.1 However, it has been recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced endotheliitis and microvascular endothelium pathology could contribute to vascular bed dysfunction in different organs and to fatal clinical sequelae in COVID-19 patients.2 Indeed, in patients who died from COVID-19, severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, and microangiopathy were detected,3 pointing to the important role of vascular pathophysiology and alterations in endothelial function in COVID-19 disease. In fact, a biomarker of endothelial activation and altered endothelial permeability, angiopoietin-2, was found to be a good predictive factor for severe cases of COVID-194 disease underscoring important pathophysiological role of vascular endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19, with its distinct vascular endotype.5 Here we suggest that the severity of COVID-19, increasing with patient age and/or the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities, might also be associated with the impairment of platelet-dependent mechanisms preserving the integrity of the endothelial barrier. Indeed, platelet-dependent endothelium-protective mechanisms play an important role in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions,6 and might safeguard the endothelial barrier of the pulmonary microcirculation alongside COVID-19-induced hyperinflammation. These protective mechanisms might be hampered or lost, particularly in patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction with inhibited platelet function or evolving thrombocytopenia, which was reported to predict severe cases of COVID-19.7Copyright © 2020 Oxford University Press.

0	40 days and 40 nights: Clinical characteristics of major trauma and orthopaedic injury comparing the incubation and lockdown phases of COVID-19 infection. Aims: The first death in the UK caused by COVID-19 occurred on 5 March 2020. We aim to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of major trauma and orthopaedic patients admitted in the early COVID-19 era., Methods: A prospective trauma registry was reviewed at a Level 1 Major Trauma Centre. We divided patients into Group A, 40 days prior to 5 March 2020, and into Group B, 40 days after., Results: A total of 657 consecutive trauma and orthopaedic patients were identified with a mean age of 55 years (8 to 98; standard deviation (SD) 22.52) and 393 (59.8%) were males. In all, 344 (approximately 50%) of admissions were major trauma. Group A had 421 patients, decreasing to 236 patients in Group B (36%). Mechanism of injury (MOI) was commonly a fall in 351 (52.4%) patients, but road traffic accidents (RTAs) increased from 56 (13.3%) in group A to 51 (21.6%) in group B (p = 0.030). ICU admissions decreased from 26 (6.2%) in group A to 5 (2.1%) in group B. Overall, 39 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with mean age of 73 years (28 to 98; SD 17.99) and 22 (56.4%) males. Common symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and pyrexia. Of these patients, 27 (69.2%) were nosocomial infections and two (5.1%) of these patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission with 8/39 mortality (20.5%). Of the patients who died, 50% were older and had underlying comorbidities (hypertension and cardiovascular disease, dementia, arthritis)., Conclusion: Trauma admissions decreased in the lockdown phase with an increased incidence of RTAs. Nosocomial infection was common in 27 (69.2%) of those with COVID-19. Symptoms and comorbidities were consistent with previous reports with noted inclusion of dementia and arthritis. The mortality rate of trauma and COVID-19 was 20.5%, mainly in octogenarians, and COVID-19 surgical mortality was 15.4%.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:330-338.

0	Lung ultrasound is a reliable diagnostic technique to predict abnormal CT chest scan and to detect oxygen requirements in COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID-19 pneumonia can be severe, with an unpredictable evolution and high mortality prevalence in older patients. The diagnosis is usually performed by RT-PCR or CT chest scan. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been proposed as an alternative method to monitor patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To assess the diagnostic performance of LUS, we performed LUS using a portable device and adapting a protocol already used in Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We used the score obtained with the index we created to assess for LUS diagnostic performance as compared to lung CT chest scan and to predict for oxygen requirements. Daily bedside LUS was easy to perform and microbiologically safe. LUS was 89% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting CT chest scan abnormalities, and 95% sensitive and 67% specific in detecting oxygen requirements. This is the first report on the diagnostic performance of LUS as compared to CT chest scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and assessments of oxygen requirements by LUS. LUS could help in the orientation of dyspneic patients to intensive care. It could also be proposed when there is limited access to CT scan in the context of a pandemic crisis, or to implement clinical lung examinations for outpatient follow-up.	false
0	Severe ischemic complications in Covid-19-A case series. Introduction: Covid-19 has the propensity to result in a wide array of manifestations. Recently, thromboembolic complications of Covid-19 have been denoted in literature. We report 5 cases of Covid-19 positive patients with no significant comorbidities who developed 1st time episodes of either; acute limb ischemia or bowel ischemia. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective observational study analyzing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of five Covid-19 positive patients. Five patients aged 38-60 presented to our institution from 1st April to 1st June and were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, subsequently developing severe vascular complications. None of our patients included had any history of thromboembolism nor risk factors that could justify the presentations. Presentation of cases: Patient 1; presented with bowel ischemia as a first presentation. Patient 2 and 3 developed unsalvageable lower limb ischemia secondary to partial to complete occlusion of infra-renal aorta. Patient 4 presented with acute upper limb ischemia due to complete occlusion of the axillary and brachial artery. Patient 5 developed bilateral lower limb unsalvageable ischemia secondary to aortic bifurcation occlusion. All patients tested Covid-19 positive upon admission, and received standard care. Discussion and conclusion: The thromboembolic complications seen in our cases were devastating and resulted in significant mortality and morbidity. All vessels affected were medium-large vessels. None of our cases had any significant predisposing medical conditions or history of thromboembolic or ischemic events. A high index of suspicion is necessary when evaluating such patients regardless of thromboembolic history. Appropriate anticoagulation regimens are essential. Our cases add to the currently increasing severe thromboembolic complications of Covid-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Severe immunosuppression and not a cytokine storm characterizes COVID-19 infections. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality have been attributed to a pathologic host response. Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN- and monocyte TFN-alpha production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN- and TNF-alpha observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN- production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.	false
0	UV light dosage distribution over irregular respirator surfaces. Methods and implications for safety. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global decrease in personal protective equipment (PPE), especially filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5x55x33cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58x41x15cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17x9 x 4cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17x6 x 5cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.	false
0	Epidemiological Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease Patients in Northwest China: High-Volume Research From Low Population Density Regions. Background: Few studies have reported the transmission characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in low-density populations. This study has therefore analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Northwestern China, an area with low population density. Methods: From January 21 to March 11, 2020, data from patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in areas of Northwestern China with lower population densities were retrospectively analyzed. Certain variables were categorized as numbers and percentages, with the ratio between resident patients (no history of going out during the epidemic) and imported patients representing the contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19. Hospitalization time was also calculated. Results: A total of 617 COVID-19 patients were reported in Northwestern China, and the morbidity and mortality rates of 0.000005 and 0.011, respectively. Further analysis showed that the morbidity was inversely proportional to population density and distance from Wuhan City. This study enrolled 473 confirmed cases; among these patients, there were 248 residents and 225 imported cases with a ratio of 1:1. The youngest and oldest patients were 1 and 94 years of age, respectively, with a median age of 42 years. Fifteen (3.2%) patients were children or infants. Two patients were pregnant, and one patient gave birth to a healthy baby with negative results during her disease course. About 17.3% of patients (82 cases) were healthy carriers without any symptoms during their disease course. One male patient (0.2%) had recurrence of a positive test result 4 days after discharge. The median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 2.0 to 43.0 days. Further analysis showed that age (P = 0.03) and severity status (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with hospitalization time. Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in the regions with a low population density were lower than those of the national average in China. All populations were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic patients with positive results should be taken seriously, and the hospitalization time of patients is associated with their age and severity status.

0	Clinical characteristics, comorbidities and outcomes among persons with HIV hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. BACKGROUND: There are limited data describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes among US persons with HIV (PWH) requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): We performed a case series of all PWH sequentially admitted with COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 at three hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. Sociodemographic, clinical and HIV-associated characteristics were collected. RESULT(S): Of 530 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized during this period, 20 occurred among PWH (3.8%). The median age was 57 (Q1-Q3, 48-62) years, 65% were men, and 85% were non-Hispanic Black. Presenting median symptom duration was 5 (Q1-Q3, 3-7) days; cough (90%), fever (65%), malaise (60%) and dyspnea (60%) were most common. On admission, 40% of patients required oxygenation support and 65% had an abnormal chest radiograph. Median length of hospitalization was 5 (Q1-Q3, 4-12) days, 30% required intensive care, 15% required intubation, and 15% died. Median CD4 cell count prior to admission was 425 (Q1-Q3, 262-815) cells/mul and 90% of patients had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml. Half of the patients had at least five comorbidities; hypertension (70%), dyslipidemia (60%) and diabetes (45%) were most prevalent. All three patients who died had CD4 cell count more than 200, HIV suppression and each had a total of five comorbidities. CONCLUSION(S): The multisite series in the Southern United States provides characteristics and early outcomes of hospitalized PWH with COVID-19. Nearly all patients had controlled HIV and a high comorbidity burden. Additional study of COVID-19 among PWH is needed to determine the role of age, comorbidities and HIV control in mediating COVID-19 presentation and its sequelae.	false
0	A Guide to COVID-19: a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic. In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS. Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces. Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the United States and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis. Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.Copyright © 2020 Federation of European Biochemical Societies	false
0	Chloroquine and COVID-19: Should we care about ototoxicity?. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first described in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It was named by the World Health Organization as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it garnered unprecedented attention from public health researchers around the world, and studies analyzing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapy have arisen in the last 2 months. Objective To review the literature and describe updated facts about the ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an important side effect that can be present in patients with COVID-19 treated with these drugs. Data Synthesis The most typical treatment regimen is 5 days of hydroxychloroquine at daily doses of 400 to 600 mg. There is no randomized clinical trial that can prove so far the efficacy of this medication, and few studies have evaluated adverse events potentially linked to their use in patients with COVID-19. While there is no concrete evidence on the incidence of ototoxicity using chloroquine in the short term, we need to consider that, as a pandemic disease, millions of patients with COVID-19 may receive this treatment, and ototoxicity can be a possible adverse event. Conclusion Despite the urgent global situation caused by the COVID-19, the risk of irreversible hearing loss may outweigh the unproven benefit of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, especially in patients with mild forms of COVID-19, who may be cured with supportive treatment. The potential hearing loss that can be caused by these medications may advise against their use in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 by Thieme Revinter Publicacoes Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	false
0	Sociodemographic and Clinical Features in Patients Presented With Accidental and Deliberate Self-Poisoning: A Comparative Study from Lady Reading Hospital Medical Teaching Institution, Peshawar, Pakistan. Objectives To evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients presented with acute self-poisoning at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. Methods and Patients A comparative study was conducted at Lady Reading Hospital MTI between May 2018 to May 2019 for a duration of 12 months. All patients diagnosed with acute self-poisoning were included in the study. Patients with inconclusive diagnosis, who were dead prior to the arrival to the hospital, or had an incomplete history of poison exposure were excluded from the study. At the time of arrival to the emergency department, the patient was first stabilized. Patients were grouped into two according to the type of exposure, i.e., accidental self-poisoning and deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded in a preformed proforma. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The mortality rate in patients with accidental poisoning was 9.62%, whereas it was 26.28% in DSP patients. Data were stratified according to the mode of poisoning, i.e., accidental vs DSP, and variables were assessed in patients who did not survive. It was found that 60% of patients who died in the accidental group were aged 0-15 years. In contrast, only one patient between aged 0-15 years died in the DSP group and the majority of the deaths occurred in those aged 25.1-35 years (31 [75.6%]). Conclusions In conclusion, women more often attempted suicide, whereas males suffered accidental poisoning more frequently. Firstly, we found a female predominance in the DSP group, whereas males were more prevalent in with young children experiencing accidental poisoning. Longer time from ingestion of poison to the arrival is associated with poor patient prognosis. Copyright © 2020, Zadran et al.	false
0	Development of a Rapid Focus Reduction Neutralization Test Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged human coronavirus that has escalated to a pandemic. There are currently no approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe respiratory illness or death. Defining the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for understanding disease progression, long-term immunity, and vaccine efficacy. Here we describe two methods for evaluating the neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The basic protocol is a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), which involves immunostaining infected cells with a chromogen deposit readout. The alternate protocol is a modification of the FRNT that uses an infectious clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 virus expressing a fluorescent reporter. These protocols are adapted for use in a high-throughput setting, and are compatible with large-scale vaccine studies or clinical testing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Basic Protocol: Focus reduction neutralization test Alternate Protocol: mNeonGreen-based focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT-mNG).

0	Knowledge, attitude, practices, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among serving personnel of a large military garrison: a quick online cross-sectional survey. Background: There is a deluge of information available and circulated about COVID-19, during the ongoing course of the pandemic. This study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, practices, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among serving soldiers. Method(s): A quick cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a web portal and social media platform, wherein a pretested questionnaire was uploaded. Responses were collected for 3 days. Data were analyzed using Epi Info software. Result(s): A total of 1231 serving personnel participated in the survey, 133 (10.80%) officers, 144 (11.69%) Junior Commissioned Officers, and 954 (77.49%) Other Ranks. The prevalence of correct knowledge was more than 80% (range 81.47-88.13) except 29.97% regarding transmission by food and water. A statistically significant association (all P values < 0.05) was found with increasing age and education. Social distancing was an effective method as per 93.54%, and 81.38% thought that the response measures were adequate. Handwashing was the only practice which demonstrated a statistically significant association across change in all 3, i.e. age (P = 0.001), education (P = 0.005) and rank (P = 0.022). In the affective domain, increased perception of anxiousness, worriedness, and not feeling relaxed was found in the responses. Conclusion(s): Levels of knowledge, positive attitude, and practice are high among serving soldiers, however feeling of anxiousness and worry prevail. Aggressive, continuous, relevant target population-oriented Information Education and Communication is the need of the hour, with structured and programmed interventions for positive mental health during course of the pandemic and this has been implemented in our area.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Long-term positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ribonucleic acid and therapeutic effect of antivirals in patients with coronavirus disease: Case reports. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared a pandemic. We herein report four COVID-19 cases with long-term positive viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) for about 61 days. Despite treatment with recombinant human interferon, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients, arbidol, etc., nucleic acid results were still positive for SARS-CoV-2. After treatment with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNVr, 100/100 mg, once daily), all four patients showed two to three consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA and were thus discharged from hospital. Therefore, DNVr may be a potentially effective antiviral for COVID-19 patients with long-term positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Copyright © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

0	Treating exuberant, non-resolving inflammation in the lung; implications for acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19. While COVID-19, the disease driven by SARS-CoV-2 has ignited interest in the host immune response to this infection, it has also highlighted the lack of treatment options for the damaging inflammatory responses driven by pathogens that precipitate the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). With the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of a second winter spike alongside seasonal flu, the need for effective and targeted anti-inflammatory agents is even more pressing. Here we discuss the aetiology of COVID-19 and the common signalling pathways driven by SARS-CoV-2, namely p38 MAP kinase. We highlight that p38 MAP kinase becomes elevated with increasing age, thereby driving many of the inflammatory pathways that precipitate death in old people with the added drawback of impairing vaccine efficacy in this susceptible age group. Finally, we review drugs available to inhibit p38 MAP kinase, their risks-versus-benefits as well as suggested dosing regimen to combat over-exuberant innate immune responses and potentially reverse vaccine inefficacy in older patients.

0	A prospective study on the incidence of postponed time-sensitive urological procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to patient preference. BACKGROUND: The risk of acquiring perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection is concerning for surgeons and patients., AIMS: In this study, we investigate the incidence of postponed, medically necessary, time-sensitive urological procedures due to a patient's unwillingness to proceed to a recommended surgical intervention during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic., METHODS: We prospectively monitored all patients undergoing elective urological surgery during the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The primary outcome measurement was incidence of postponed, medically necessary, urological procedures due to the patient's decision not to proceed to a recommended urological intervention (16th of March-5th of June 2020). The secondary outcome measurements were the type of delayed procedure and duration of postponement., RESULTS: During the initial 12-week period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 155 elective urgent urological procedures were scheduled after pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 screening. In total, 140 procedures were performed and 15 (10%) patients intentionally delayed their urological procedure due to the perceived risk of acquiring nosocomial perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. The duration for procedural delays is currently 42 +/- 23 (range: 15-80) days. The most frequently postponed procedures among patients unwilling to proceed to surgery are urgent endourological procedures due to symptomatic urolithiasis (n = 7/15)., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence for patients postponing urological procedures due to the risk of acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 is 10%. Endourological procedures for urolithiasis are the most frequently postponed procedures by patients. This study demonstrates that a subset of patients will decline urgent urological surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.	false
0	Chaotic-map based authenticated security framework with privacy preservation for remote point-of-care. The challenge of COVID-19 has become more prevalent across the world. It is highly demanding an intelligent strategy to outline the precaution measures until the clinical trials find a successful vaccine. With technological advancement, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has extended its significant role in the development of remote medical point-of-care (RM-PoC). WMSN is generally located on a communication device to sense the vital signaling information that may periodically be transmitted to remote intelligent pouch This modern remote system finds a suitable professional system to inspect the environment condition remotely in order to facilitate the intelligent process. In the past, the RM-PoC has gained more attention for the exploitation of real-time monitoring, treatment follow-up, and action report generation. Even though it has additional advantages in comparison with conventional systems, issues such as security and privacy are seriously considered to protect the modern system information over insecure public networks. Therefore, this study presents a novel Single User Sign-In (SUSI) Mechanism that makes certain of privacy preservation to ensure better protection of multimedia data. It can be achieved over the negotiation of a shared session-key to perform encryption or decryption of sensitive data during the authentication phase. To comply with key agreement properties such as appropriate mutual authentication and secure session key-agreement, a proposed system design is incorporated into the chaotic-map. The above assumption claims that it can not only achieve better security efficiencies but also can moderate the computation, communication, and storage cost of some intelligent systems as compared to elliptic-curve cryptography or RSA. Importantly, in order to offer untraceability and user anonymity, the RM-PoC acquires dynamic identities from proposed SUSI. Moreover, the security efficiencies of proposed SUSI are demonstrated using informal and formal analysis of the real-or-random (RoR) model. Lastly, a simulation study using NS3 is extensively conducted to analyze the communication metrics such as transmission delay, throughput rate, and packet delivery ratio that demonstrates the significance of the proposed SUSI scheme.

This clinical review paper discusses the pathophysiology of the pulmonary and cardiovascular manifestations of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ensuing implications on acute cardiovascular care in patients presenting with a severe COVID-19 syndrome admitted to an intensive acute cardiac care unit. The high prevalence of old age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease in patients who develop a severe to critical COVID-19 syndrome suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and an impaired innate immune response promote the development by the viral infection of an acute endothelialitis in the pulmonary microcirculation complicated by abnormal vasoconstrictor responses, luminal plugging by inflammatory cells, and intravascular thrombosis. This endothelialitis extends into the systemic circulation what may lead to acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, and thromboembolic complications both in the arterial and venous circulation. Ever since the first case reports from the city of Wuhan in China in December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues as a raging pandemic causing significant morbidity and mortality [1]. In this paper we provide a review of the epidemiological characteristics and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and formulate the hypothesis that endothelialitis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary and cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.	false

0	Back to basics: review on vitamin D and respiratory viral infections including COVID-19. Importance: As the scientific community is in a marathon in finding out the cure for COVID-19, in this crisis, it is essential for the physicians not to forget about the basics. Due to the pandemic crisis, in many nursing homes and hospitals, there established new policies on decreasing unnecessary medications to minimize cross-contamination. Sometimes these policies are making providers avoid essential drugs such as Vitamins, including Vitamin D. In this paper, we try to emphasize the importance of Vitamin D in COVID-19 and respiratory viral patients., Relevance: Vitamin D helps in decreasing the 'pro-inflammatory cytokines' in the lungs and acts in immunomodulatory function, and 'also it will increase the anti-inflammatory, antiviral responses of the respiratory epithelial cells during infection.', Conclusion: Due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and the increased morbidity and mortality with no appropriate therapy and vaccine, one must be cautious and do everything to help COVID-19 patients. In hospitals and other health care settings to decrease cross-contamination, holding other non-essential medications is taking place. Discontinuing Vitamins could increase the mortality and morbidity of those affected, especially in deficient/insufficient individuals. Obtaining serum 25 (OH) D levels in all patients with viral respiratory infections, especially COVID-19, could help in the detection and treatment of Vitamin D deficiency and potentially decrease recovery time and improve outcome. Even though evidence suggests that vitamin D has the anti-inflammatory, antiviral properties, randomized double-blinded controlled trials are needed to verify this further, and to understand Vitamin D and COVID-19 better., Abbreviations: Vitamin D receptor-VDR; 25(OH)D- 25 hydroxyvitamin D; 1,25 (OH)D-1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D; 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D-1,25[OH]2 D or calcitriol; IU- International Units; Interferons stimulated genes- ISG; ARI- acute respiratory infection; RSV- respiratory syncytial virus; RTI- Respiratory tract infections; COPD-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; BMI-Basal metabolic index; USA-USA.

0	GM-CSF Neutralization With Lenzilumab in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Case-Cohort Study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia., METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use investigational new drug application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. We also identified a cohort of patients matched to the lenzilumab patients for age, sex, and disease severity. Study dates were March 13, 2020, to June 18, 2020. All patients were followed through hospital discharge or death., RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated with lenzilumab; 27 patients comprised the matched control cohort (untreated). Clinical improvement, defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale, was observed in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (P=.006). Similarly, the proportion of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen<315 mm Hg) was significantly reduced over time when treated with lenzilumab compared with untreated (P<.001). Significant improvement in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin 6) and markers of disease severity (absolute lymphocyte count) were observed in patients who received lenzilumab, but not in untreated patients. Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells 2 days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab., CONCLUSION: In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with faster improvement in clinical outcomes, including oxygenation, and greater reductions in inflammatory markers compared with a matched control cohort of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to validate these findings is ongoing (NCT04351152). Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	A case of Sars-Cov-2 infection in an HIV patient. Coronavirus disease 2019, which emerged in Wuhan in China in early December 2019, gradually spread across the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March, 12 2020. The disease shows a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic course to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Although data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in HIV-infected cases are still limited, it is thought that the presence of comorbidities is important for mortality and morbidity in infected cases. In this report, it was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient diagnosed with HIV for six years with negative HIV-1 viral load and a CD4 lymphocyte count of 240 cells/mm3Copyright © 2020 Bilimsel Tip Yayinevi.

0	A Pediatric Infectious Diseases Perspective of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children. Understanding the role that children play in the clinical burden and propagation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, is emerging. While the severe manifestations and acute clinical burden of COVID-19 have largely spared children compared with adults, understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, management, and prevention opportunities and the social and behavioral impacts on child health is vital. Foremost is clarifying the contribution of asymptomatic and mild infections to transmission within the household and community and the clinical and epidemiologic significance of uncommon severe post-infectious complications. Here, we summarize the current knowledge, identify resources, and outline research opportunities. Pediatric infectious diseases clinicians have a unique opportunity to advocate for the inclusion of children in epidemiological, clinical, treatment, and prevention studies to optimize their care as well as to represent children in the development of guidance and policy during pandemic response.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Antibody-Based Immunotherapeutic Strategies for COVID-19. Global efforts to contain the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) include the development of novel preventive vaccines and effective therapeutics. Passive antibody therapies using convalescent plasma, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrome-Corona-Virus-2)-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are among the most promising strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, several immunomodulatory antibodies acting via several mechanisms to boost the host immune defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as to avoid the harmful overreaction of the immune system are currently under clinical trial. Our main objective is to present the current most up-to-date progress in some clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. We highlight the pros and pitfalls of several SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunotherapeutics.	false
0	Development of Diagnostic Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2. One of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is to develop accurate and rapid diagnostic tests. There are a number of molecular, serological, and imaging methods that are used to diagnose this infection in hospitals and clinical settings. The purpose of this review paper is to present the available approaches for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and address the advantages and limitations of each detection method. This work includes studies from recent literature publications along with information from the manufacturer's manuals of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic products. Furthermore, supplementary information from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and World Health Organization (WHO) is cited. The viral components targeted for virus detection, the principles of each diagnostic technique, and the detection efficiency of each approach are discussed. The potential of using diagnostic tests that were originally developed for previous epidemic viruses is also presented.	false

Here, we provide an extensive overview of all reported COVID-19 cases in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in the Netherlands between 27 February and 9 June 2020, gathered by the Dutch MS Taskforce of the Netherlands Society of Neurology. A total of 86 MS patients were reported, 43 of whom tested positive for COVID-19. Of 43 patients who tested positive, 22 patients were hospitalized. Three intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and four deaths were reported. Our findings show no apparent difference in disease-modifying treatment (DMT) use and COVID-19 disease course in Dutch MS patients. In addition, a clear link between low lymphocyte count and severe disease was not observed.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.	false

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) and cognitive decline (CD) are costly, challenging to treat, highly prevalent among older adults, and worsen each other over time. We are iteratively developing Active-Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count aided by a Fitbit. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and signals of improvement in emotional, physical, and cognitive function when delivered in-person to this population., OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (Health Enhancement Program; HEP) in older adults with CP and CD. Due to COVID-19 and qualitative feedback from former participants, both programs are delivered in an entirely virtual format via live video (Zoom). Here, we describe our virtual study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design. We will evaluate feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and cognitive function., METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are randomized to one of two programs: AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, institutional registries, and IRB-approved flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate sealed envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via secure live video. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-minute walk test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via live video at baseline and post-intervention. Primary outcomes are a-priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative measures, adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional function, as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, pain-specific coping, mindfulness)., RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F, 11 HEP) across two rounds. Only two participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline, 1 before first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline. In the first round, attendance is high (11/12 completed all 4 sessions so far) and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5/6)., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention but need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body and activity program to older adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for the virtual assessments and intervention delivery will inform treatment development for older adults generally and those with CP-CD specifically, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond., CLINICALTRIAL: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04044183."	false
0	Impact of microbiota: A paradigm for evolving herd immunity against viral diseases. Herd immunity is the most critical and essential prophylactic intervention that delivers protection against infectious diseases at both the individual and community level. This process of natural vaccination is immensely pertinent to the current context of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection around the globe. The conventional idea of herd immunity is based on efficient transmission of pathogens and developing natural immunity within a population. This is entirely encouraging while fighting against any disease in pandemic circumstances. A spatial community is occupied by people having variable resistance capacity against a pathogen. Protection efficacy against once very common diseases like smallpox, poliovirus or measles has been possible only because of either natural vaccination through contagious infections or expanded immunization programs among communities. This has led to achieving herd immunity in some cohorts. The microbiome plays an essential role in developing the body's immune cells for the emerging competent vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. Frequency of interaction among microbiota, metabolic nutrients and individual immunity preserve the degree of vaccine effectiveness against several pathogens. Microbiome symbiosis regulates pathogen transmissibility and the success of vaccination among different age groups. Imbalance of nutrients perturbs microbiota and abrogates immunity. Thus, a particular population can become vulnerable to the infection. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to environmental enteropathy (EE). As a consequence, the generation of herd immunity can either be delayed or not start in a particular cohort. Moreover, disparities of the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries outside of developed countries are due to inconsistencies of healthy microbiota among the individuals. We suggested that pan-India poliovirus vaccination program, capable of inducing herd immunity among communities for the last 30 years, may also influence the inception of natural course of heterologous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, this anamnestic recall is somewhat counterintuitive, as antibody generation against original antigens of SARS-CoV-2 will be subdued due to original antigenic sin.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Convalescent plasma - Is it useful for treating SARS Co-V2 infection?. The world is challenged with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Although preventive measures such as social distancing, personal protective equipment and isolation would decrease the spread of the infection, a definitive treatment is still under way. Antivirals, immunisation, convalescent plasma (CP) and many more modalities are under trial, and there has been no definite answer to the management of COVID-19 infection. All patients so far have received the standard and symptomatic care. It is shown that the SARS-CoV 2 is a respiratory pathogen, and 80% of the infected patients would recover from the illness and it is the 20% of the infected patients require hospitalisation and even critical care. CP has been used to treat recent epidemic respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections with promising results. The CP of a recovered individual contains antibodies which neutralise the virus and decrease the viral replication in the patient. It is a classic adaptive immunotherapy and has been applied in the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases. CP is plasma taken from a person who has recovered from an infection, which contains neutralising antibodies against the said infection. Giving CP to susceptible individuals or infected patients is a form of passive antibody therapy and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, is expected to provide protection by viral neutralisation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. The adaptive response is to a specific antigen-binding array of molecules that are foreign to the host. The human response to viruses uses both the innate and the adaptive arms in its attempt to rid the host of the invading pathogen. The humoral response is a component of the adaptive immune response that allows for antibodies to bind to foreign invading pathogens, marks the pathogens and their toxins for phagocytosis and recruits further phagocytic cells to the site via the activation of the complement system and eventually prevents the pathogen from infecting target cells. Studies from Wuhan from various institutions during the research on COVID-19 infections during December 2019 have also shown promising results. Till date, randomised controlled studies for the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking, and many countries have invited institutions to participate in clinical trials. The Indian Council of Medical research and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Government of India, have allowed the use of CP as an investigational drug under a trial basis. Internationally, agencies such as the USFDA, American Association of Blood Banks, European Blood Safety and British Blood Transfusion Society have also come out with various guidelines for the use of CP in COVID-19 infection. This article will review the current guidelines for the use of CP and compare the various guidelines of different agencies.	false
0	Prophylactic Dressings for Maintaining Skin Integrity of Healthcare Workers When Using N95 Respirators While Preventing Contamination Due to the Novel Coronavirus: A Quality Improvement Project. PURPOSE: Extended use of N95 respirator masks is far more prevalent during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As WOC nurses, we were tasked with formulating procedures for protecting the facial skin integrity of healthcare workers (HCWs) using personal protective devices when caring for patients with suspected or active COVID-19, while avoiding contamination when the masks are donned or doffed. This quality improvement project describes how we approached this project within the limited time frame available as we cared for patients with established and suspected COVID-19., PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This project focused on HCW use of N95 respirator masks and dressings currently available in our facility. The 4 WOC nurses acted as quality improvement project directors and as participants. The setting for our project was our facility's simulation laboratory., APPROACH: We evaluated 6 topical products (an alcohol-free liquid acrylate, thin film dressing, thin hydrocolloid dressing, hydrocolloid blister care cushion, thin foam transfer dressing, and thick foam dressing) applied to skin in contact with 3 N95 respirators; all are available on our facility's formulary and all are in widespread clinical use. After the product was applied to the face and nose, the N95 respirator was donned and evaluated for fit. Participants then wore the devices for 10 hours and doffed the mask using established facility procedures. In order to evaluate for potential contamination including possible aerosolization, we applied a commercially available fluorescent lotion to simulate the presence of infectious particles. Contamination was assessed using an ultraviolet light for all dressings except for the alcohol-free liquid acrylate. We also evaluated cutaneous responses (skin integrity, irritation, comfort) during this period., OUTCOMES: We found that contamination of the simulated pathogen did not occur with removal of any of the protective products. No skin irritation was noted with any of the tested products after a 10-hour wear time underneath the N95 respirator masks, but mild discomfort was experienced with 3 of the dressings (thin film dressing and both hydrocolloid dressings)., CONCLUSION: Based on these experiences, we recommend application of an alcohol-free liquid acrylate film to prevent facial skin injury associated with friction from the extended use of an N95 respirator mask. We further recommend performing a fit test and user-performed seal check with the use of any topical dressing and especially those that add cushion. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend use of protective dressings to maintain skin integrity and protection from coronavirus infection as HCWs continue to provide care to all of patients under their care.	false

0	Detection-based prioritisation: Framework of multi-laboratory characteristics for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers based on integrated Entropy-TOPSIS methods. Context and background: Corona virus (COVID) has rapidly gained a foothold and caused a global pandemic. Particularists try their best to tackle this global crisis. New challenges outlined from various medical perspectives may require a novel design solution. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers show different health conditions and no symptoms; hence, a differentiation process is required to avert the risk of chronic virus carriers. Objective(s): Laboratory criteria and patient dataset are compulsory in constructing a new framework. Prioritisation is a popular topic and a complex issue for patients with COVID-19, especially for asymptomatic carriers due to multi-laboratory criteria, criterion importance and trade-off amongst these criteria. This study presents new integrated decision-making framework that handles the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19 and can detect the health conditions of asymptomatic carriers. Method(s): The methodology includes four phases. Firstly, eight important laboratory criteria are chosen using two feature selection approaches. Real and simulation datasets from various medical perspectives are integrated to produce a new dataset involving 56 patients with different health conditions and can be used to check asymptomatic cases that can be detected within the prioritisation configuration. The first phase aims to develop a new decision matrix depending on the intersection between 'multi-laboratory criteria' and 'COVID-19 patient list'. In the second phase, entropy is utilised to set the objective weight, and TOPSIS is adapted to prioritise patients in the third phase. Finally, objective validation is performed. Result(s): The patients are prioritised based on the selected criteria in descending order of health situation starting from the worst to the best. The proposed framework can discriminate among mild, serious and critical conditions and put patients in a queue while considering asymptomatic carriers. Validation findings revealed that the patients are classified into four equal groups and showed significant differences in their scores, indicating the validity of ranking. Conclusion(s): This study implies and discusses the numerous benefits of the suggested framework in detecting/recognising the health condition of patients prior to discharge, supporting the hospitalisation characteristics, managing patient care and optimising clinical prediction rule.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	"Tracing day-zero and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A compartmental modelling and numerical optimization approach. Introduction Italy became the second epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after China, surpassing by far China's death toll. The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case ""zero"" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ""effective"" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to ""forecast"" the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: *10% to *30%).Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Addictive Disorders: Focus on Opioid Dependence and Opioid Maintenance Treatment-The Bavarian Experience. Background: The covid-19 pandemic challenges patients with severe mental illnesses in many aspects. Curfews, quarantine and isolation are stressors that impair mental wellbeing and can lead to increases in substance use or relapse in patients with substance use disorders. Among the latter, patients with opioid use disorder are particularly vulnerable due to high prevalence of psychiatric or somatic comorbidities. On the other hand, both availability and access to health care is limited during the pandemic, which severely affects patients under opioid maintenance therapy (OMT). Aim(s): This report focusses on the Bavarian experience with opioid dependent patients and OMT. Conclusion(s): Measures to counteract the health risks for this group of patients require the maintenance of OMT facilities under safe conditions in terms of service, hygiene and risk of infection.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression and significance of SAA, CRP and FERR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 225 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to the North Hospital of First Hospital in Changsha, China, from 9th February 2020 to 7th March 2020 were enrolled. Their general data, laboratory test results and levels of SAA, CRP and FERR were extracted from electronic medical records., RESULTS: Age was an important risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in the patients. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in the levels of total protein, albumin, ALT and AST in liver function, UA in renal function, myocardial enzyme CK-MB and LDH, and immunoglobulin IgG and IgM. The levels of SAA, CRP, and FERR were significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis results showed that the AUC, from small to large, was as follows: SAA+CRP+FERR, CRP + FERR, SAA + CRP, SAA + FERR, SAA, FERR, and CRP, which indicated the benefit of the combination of the three indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of the three indicators were higher than those of the detection of any single indicator or two combined indicators. A Spearman correlation analysis of the data showed that the initial CRP/SAA, SAA/FERR, and CRP/FERR were positively correlated. The continuous results of SAA, CRP and FERR throughout the study period showed that the values of the severe group on a given day were higher than those of the non-severe group; the values of the two groups peaked on the 5th or 7th day and then decreased, and the decreasing trend of the severe group was more evident., CONCLUSIONS: SAA, CRP and FERR are sensitive serological indicators used to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. The combined detection of serum SAA, FERR, and CRP, which are positively related to COVID-19 infection, offers guiding significance for the occurrence of COVID-19 infection and the severity of the disease. Such detection provides effective detection indicators for the progress and prognosis of COVID-19; these indicators will enable effective intervention measures to be implemented in time and the rates of severe illness and mortality to be reduced.	false
0	[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after SARS-CoV-2 infection]. In the era of the coronavirus disease pandemic, a new disease entity named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has emerged. This is a case report of a seven-year-old boy with hyperinflammation and cardiac involvement, compatible with this disease entity. Antibody tests and symptoms indicated previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The patient was treated according to international guidelines with full symptom resolution. Awareness of this inflammatory syndrome should prompt immediate treatment and could possibly avoid fatal outcomes.	false
0	You can make a difference in the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin is a preparation of immune globulins containing antibodies given intravenously to patients with both inherited and acquired immunodeficiency disorders, such as primary immune deficiency diseases, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and bone marrow transplantation. This article discusses immune globulin products, routes of administration, and the role of the infusion nurse in the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin to the patient.	false
0	Best-practice IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin use in patients with sepsis. Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite treatment being in line with current guidelines, mortality remains high in those with septic shock. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent a promising therapy to modulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and can contribute to the elimination of pathogens. In this context, there is evidence of the benefits of immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-enriched immunoglobulin therapy for sepsis. This manuscript aims to summarize current relevant data to provide expert opinions on best practice for the use of an IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin) in adult patients with sepsis. Main text: Sepsis patients with hyperinflammation and patients with immunosuppression may benefit most from treatment with IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin). Patients with hyperinflammation present with phenotypes that manifest throughout the body, whilst the clinical characteristics of immunosuppression are less clear. Potential biomarkers for hyperinflammation include elevated procalcitonin, interleukin-6, endotoxin activity and C-reactive protein, although thresholds for these are not well-defined. Convenient biomarkers for identifying patients in a stage of immune-paralysis are still matter of debate, though human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related expression on monocytes, lymphocyte count and viral reactivation have been proposed. The timing of treatment is potentially more critical for treatment efficacy in patients with hyperinflammation compared with patients who are in an immunosuppressed stage. Due to the lack of evidence, definitive dosage recommendations for either population cannot be made, though we suggest that patients with hyperinflammation should receive an initial bolus at a rate of up to 0.6 mL (30 mg)/kg/h for 6 h followed by a continuous maintenance rate of 0.2 mL (10 mg)/kg/hour for >= 72 h (total dose >= 0.9 g/kg). For immunosuppressed patients, dosage is more conservative (0.2 mL [10 mg]/kg/h) for >= 72 h, without an initial bolus (total dose >= 0.72 g/kg). Conclusion(s): Two distinct populations that may benefit most from Pentaglobin therapy are described in this review. However, further clinical evidence is required to strengthen support for the recommendations given here regarding timing, duration and dosage of treatment.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Yield of Screening for COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients Before Elective or Emergency Surgery Using Chest CT and RT-PCR (SCOUT): Multicenter Study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the yield of preoperative screening for COVID-19 with chest CT and RT-PCR in patients without COVID-19 symptoms. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many centers are currently screening surgical patients for COVID-19 using either chest CT, RT-PCR or both, due to the risk for worsened surgical outcomes and nosocomial spread. The optimal design and yield of such a strategy are currently unknown. METHOD(S): This multicenter study included consecutive adult patients without COVID-19 symptoms who underwent preoperative screening using chest CT and RT-PCR before elective or emergency surgery under general anesthesia. RESULT(S): A total of 2093 patients without COVID-19 symptoms were included in 14 participating centers; 1224 were screened by CT and RT-PCR and 869 by chest CT only. The positive yield of screening using a combination of chest CT and RT-PCR was 1.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8-2.1]. Individual yields were 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2-1.1) for chest CT and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-1.7) for RT-PCR; the incremental yield of chest CT was 0.4%. In relation to COVID-19 community prevalence, up to ~6% positive RT-PCR was found for a daily hospital admission rate >1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, and around 1.0% for lower prevalence. CONCLUSION(S): One in every 100 patients without COVID-19 symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR; this yield increased in conjunction with community prevalence. The added value of chest CT was limited. Preoperative screening allowed us to take adequate precautions for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in a surgical population, whereas negative patients needed only routine procedures.	false
0	Respiratory tract infections among French Hajj pilgrims from 2014 to 2017. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common among Hajj pilgrims, but risk factors for RTIs and respiratory pathogen acquisition during the Hajj are not clearly identified. Based on previous studies, most frequent pathogens acquired by Hajj pilgrims were investigated: rhinovirus, human coronaviruses, influenza viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 485 pilgrims were included. 82.1% presented with RTIs. Respiratory chronic diseases were associated with cough, Influenza-like illness (ILI) and the acquisition of H. influenzae. Vaccination against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and influenza was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. pneumoniae and prevalence of ILI (aRR=0.53, 95%CI [0.39-0.73] and aRR=0.69, 95%CI [0.52-0.92] respectively). Individuals carrying rhinovirus and H. influenzae-S. pneumoniae together were respectively twice and five times more likely to have respiratory symptoms. Individual with H. influenzae-K. pneumoniae carriage were twice (p=0.04) as likely to develop a cough. The use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus (aRR=0.75, 95%CI [0.57-0.97]). Results could be used to identify pilgrims at increased risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Results also confirm the effectiveness of influenza and IPD vaccinations in reducing ILI symptoms and acquisition of S. pneumoniae carriage respectively.	false
0	Do Paramedics Have a Professional Obligation to Work During a Pandemic? A Qualitative Exploration of Community Member Expectations. OBJECTIVES: Previous research has identified a lack of clarification regarding paramedic professional obligation to work. Understanding community expectations of paramedics will provide some clarity around this issue. The objective of this research was to explore the expectations of a sample of Australian community members regarding the professional obligation of paramedics to respond during pandemics. METHOD(S): The authors used qualitative methods to gather Australian community member perspectives immediately before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Focus groups were used for data collection, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULT(S): The findings revealed 9 key themes: context of obligation (normal operations versus crisis situation), hierarchy of obligation (individual versus organizational obligation), risk acceptability, acceptable occupational risk (it's part of the job), access to personal protective equipment, legal and ethical guidelines, education and training, safety, and acceptable limitations to obligation. The factors identified as being acceptable limitations to professional obligation are presented as further sub-themes: physical health, mental health, and competing personal obligations. CONCLUSION(S): The issue of professional obligation must be addressed by ambulance services as a matter of urgency, especially in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Further research is recommended to understand how community member expectations evolve during and after the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.	false
0	Associations between air pollution and COVID-19 epidemic during quarantine period in China. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global public health threaten. A series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China, contributing to the improvement of air quality. In this study, we described the trend of air pollutant concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 235 Chinese cities. Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O3). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters <=2.5 mum (PM2.5), particulate matter with diameters <=10 mum (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (lag0-15), PM10 (lag0-15), and NO2 (lag0-20) were associated with a 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): (4-9)], 6% [95% CI: (3-8)], and 19% [95% CI: (13-24)] increase in the counts of daily onset cases, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a statistically significant association between ambient air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the spread by improving ambient air quality, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Short-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, may contribute to an increase in the counts of daily onset cases. Stringent prevention and control measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the virus spread by reducing air pollution, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Antibody Detection and Dynamic Characteristics in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been rapidly spreading nationwide and abroad. A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. METHOD(S): The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The serodiagnostic power of the specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and consistency rate. RESULT(S): The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the fourth day after symptom onset. In the patients with confirmed COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, respectively, and those of IgG were 83.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9%. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, respectively, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 and rely on great specificity. CONCLUSION(S): The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stages of the illness. Antibody detection may play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as a complementary approach to viral nucleic acid assays.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Structure-guided covalent stabilization of coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimers in the closed conformation. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10 million infections and more than 500,000 fatalities by June 2020. To initiate infection, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes attachment to the host cell surface and fusion of the viral and host membranes. Prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of vaccine design. However, its limited stability and conformational dynamics are limiting factors for developing countermeasures against this virus. We report here the design of a construct corresponding to the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond in the closed conformation. Structural and antigenicity analyses show we successfully shut S in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture. We demonstrate that this strategy is applicable to other beta-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and might become an important tool for structural biology, serology, vaccine design and immunology studies.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	The effect of lockdown on the outcomes of COVID-19 in Spain: An ecological study. It is paramount to expand the knowledge base and minimize the consequences of the pandemic caused by the new Coronavirus (SARS-Cov2). Spain is among the most affected countries that declared a countrywide lockdown. An ecological study is presented herein, assessing the trends for incidence, mortality, hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, and recoveries per autonomous community in Spain. Trends were evaluated by the Joinpoint software. The timeframe employed was when the lockdown was declared on March 14, 2020. Daily percentage changes were also calculated, with CI = 95% and p<0.05. An increase was detected, followed by reduction, for the evaluated indicators in most of the communities. Approximately 18.33 days were required for the mortality rates to decrease. The highest mortality rate was verified in Madrid (118.89 per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in Melilla (2.31). The highest daily percentage increase in mortality occurred in Catalonia. Decreasing trends were identified after approximately two weeks of the institution of the lockdown by the government. Immediately the lockdown was declared, an increase of up to 33.96% deaths per day was verified in Catalonia. In contrast, Ceuta and Melilla presented significantly lower rates because they were still at the early stages of the pandemic at the moment of lockdown. The findings presented herein emphasize the importance of early and assertive decision-making to contain the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Siqueira et al.

0	Introducing the GEV Activation Function for Highly Unbalanced Data to Develop COVID-19 Diagnostic Models. Fast and accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient and effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently disrupting the whole world. Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification. This new paradigm is expected to play a significant role in the fight against COVID-19 and other diseases, with relatively few training cases available.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.	false
0	42 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 of the ordinary type with the adjuvant treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion 42. Objective: To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of adjuvant treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) of the ordinary type. Method(s): A total of 42 patients with COVID-19 of the ordinary type were adopted. Shenque ( CV8) and Tianshu ( ST25) were selected. Heat-sensitive moxibustion was operated according to the required standard, 40 min to 60 min each time, once daily. Before and after moxibustion, the improvements in clinical symptoms were evaluated, such as chest oppression, poor appetite, lassitude and negative emotions. Result(s): (1) The number of cases and the incidence was 21 cases (50.0%), 24 cases (57.1%) and 26 cases (61.9%) for chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude before heat-sensitive moxibustion. The number of cases was reduced to be 10 cases (23.8%), 7 cases (16.7%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 1st treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion for chest oppression, poor appetite, and lassitude. It was reduced to be 11 cases (26.2%), 8 cases (19.0%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 2nd treatment of moxibustion and it was reduced to be 18 cases (42.9%), 10 cases (23.8%) and 6 cases (14.3%) after the 3rd treatment of moxibustion. The incidences of the symptoms were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (2) Before treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion, there were 24 cases of negative emotions (57.1%). It was reduced to be 16 cases (38.1%), 11 cases (26.2%) and 3 cases (7.1%) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion successively. The incidences were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (3) After the 1st treatment, the active acceptance rate of heat-sensitive moxibustion was 100% (42/42) in the patients, higher than 11.9% (5/42) before treatment. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion effectively relieves the symptoms of COVID-19 such as chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude, and alleviates the negative emotions, such as tension and anxiety. This therapy improves the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 and deserves to be promoted in clinical practice.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Assembly of coronavirus spike protein into trimers and its role in epitope expression. The folding and oligomerization of coronavirus spike protein were explored using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Chemical cross-linking and sedimentation experiments showed that the spike of transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a homotrimer of the S membrane glycoprotein. The spike protein was synthesized as a 175,000-apparent-molecular-weight (175K) monomer subunit that is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Assembly of monomers into a trimeric structure was found to occur on a partially trimmed polypeptide and to be a rate-limiting step, since large amounts of monomers failed to trimerize 1 h after completion of synthesis. Terminal glycosylation of newly assembled trimers, resulting in the biosynthesis of three 220K oligomers, occurred with a half time of approximately 20 min. Monomeric (230K to 240K) processed forms were also observed in cells and in virions. The 175K monomeric form expressed four major antigenic sites previously localized within the amino-terminal half of the S polypeptide chain; however, two classes of trimer-restricted epitopes (borne by three 220K and/or three 174K oligomers) were identified. The S glycoproteins of coronavirus might be a valuable model system for discovering new aspects of the maturation of membrane glycoproteins.	false
0	Management of Canadian Pediatric Patients With Glomerular Diseases During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From the Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists COVID-19 Rapid Response Team. Purpose: The goal of these recommendations is to provide guidance on the optimal care of children with glomerular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with glomerular diseases are known to be more susceptible to infection. Risk factors include decreased vaccine uptake, urinary loss of immunoglobulins, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) recently published guidelines on the care of adult glomerulonephritis patients. This guideline aims to expand and adapt those recommendations for programs caring for children with glomerular diseases. Sources of information: We used the CSN COVID-19 Rapid Response Team adult glomerulonephritis recommendations, published in the Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease, as the foundation for our guidelines. We reviewed documents published by nephrology and non-nephrology societies and health care agencies focused on kidney disease and immunocompromised populations. Finally, we conducted a formal literature review of publications relevant to pediatric and adult glomerular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and immunosuppression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): The leadership of the Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists (CAPN), which is affiliated with the CSN, identified a team of clinicians and researchers with expertise in pediatric glomerular diseases. The aim was to adapt Canadian adult glomerulonephritis guidelines to make them applicable to children and discuss pediatric-specific considerations. The updated guidelines were peer-reviewed by senior clinicians with expertise in the care of childhood glomerular diseases. Key Findings: We identified a number of key areas of glomerular disease care likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) visit types, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) blood work and imaging, (5) home monitoring, (6) immunosuppression, (7) other medications, (8) immunizations, (9) management of children with suspected COVID-19, (10) renal biopsy, (11) patient education and support, and (12) school and child care. Limitation(s): There are minimal data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in adult or pediatric glomerular disease patients, as well as the efficacy of strategies to prevent infection transmission within these populations. Therefore, the majority of these recommendations are based on expert opinion and consensus guidance. To expedite the publication of these guidelines, an internal peer-review process was conducted, which may not have been as rigorous as formal journal peer-review. Implications: These guidelines are intended to promote optimal care delivery for children with existing or newly diagnosed glomerular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of modified care delivery, altered immunosuppression strategies, and limited access to existing resources remain uncertain.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Do Lifestyle Changes of Renal Transplant Recipients During the Pandemic Reduce the Risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019?. Introduction: There is no published study regarding the effects of preventive measures on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequency in renal transplantation recipients. The aim of this study is to reveal the preventive measures taken by renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these measures influence the prevalence of the disease. Material(s) and Method(s): After detecting the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, we briefed all of our renal transplant recipients on preventive measures regarding COVID-19. Two months afterward, a questionnaire was prepared regarding the preventive measures practiced by renal transplant recipients, and patients were asked whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms or had received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Result(s): Among 132 patients, 68 were surveyed through telephone calls. During this time, 95.5% of patients were in isolation at home except for when seeing to their essential needs. Two (2.9%) patients were hospitalized due to increases in creatinine level and urinary tract infection. All patients have worn masks when going out and stated that they washed their hands more frequently. There was a decrease in the frequency of hospital controls in 79.4% of patients. Although 2 (2.9%) patients had complaints of dysuria and fever, they did not apply to the hospital because they thought hospitals carried risk during the pandemic. One patient had a cough with fever and was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 but tested negative. Discussion(s): It was determined that renal transplant recipients in our study population meticulously complied with preventive measures and increased the use of masks and hand hygiene practices. As a result, none were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Human molecular chaperones share with SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes potentially capable of eliciting autoimmunity against endothelial cells: possible role of molecular mimicry in COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19 disease, has the potential to elicit autoimmunity because mimicry of human molecular chaperones by viral proteins. We compared viral proteins with human molecular chaperones, many of which are heat shock proteins, to determine if they share amino acid-sequence segments with immunogenic-antigenic potential, which can elicit cross-reactive antibodies and effector immune cells with the capacity to damage-destroy human cells by a mechanism of autoimmunity. We identified the chaperones that can putatively participate in molecular mimicry phenomena after SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on those for which endothelial cell plasma-cell membrane localization has already been demonstrated. We also postulate that post-translational modifications, induced by physical (shear) and chemical (metabolic) stress caused respectively by the risk factors hypertension and diabetes, might have a role in determining plasma-cell membrane localization and, in turn, autoimmune-induced endothelial damage.Copyright © 2020, Cell Stress Society International.	false

0	Lung ultrasound (LUS) in COVID-19 pneumonia: Usefulness in two atypical cases. Clinical experience and scientific articles have shown that patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) can be paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In this paper, we will discuss two paucisymptomatic patients with blood tests suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs and without typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest high-resolution computed tomography. In these cases, lung ultrasound helped to raise clinical suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia and facilitate diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS * During the current COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) is being used extensively to evaluate and monitor lung damage in infected patients. * Several patients have been described with negative PCR swabs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. * Typical signs of interstitial pneumonia on LUS strongly indicate COVID-19 pneumonia, thus suggesting further investigation and invasive tests to confirm the diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 SMC Media Srl.

0	"103 Impact of Stay-at-Home Orders on Reported Pediatric Poisonings during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Study Objectives: Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the illness ""COVID-19,"" was announced by China in December 2019. Soon after, a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania (PA) were first announced on March 6, 2020. Subsequently, there were limitations of gatherings and travel, closure of schools and non-essential businesses and physical distancing. With limitations, children were at home for longer periods of time and subsequently had increased access to potentially poisonous substances, such as over the counter medications, prescriptions, medications that are only delivered in a clinic but were given for home use due to closures, and increased amounts of cleaning supplies. The inherent isolation that comes with physical distancing was feared to surge depression and suicidal gestures particularly among adolescents. We know from previous natural disasters that an increase in reported exposures to poison control centers follow a major incident. We anticipated an increase in reported pediatric exposures to the Poison Control Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP PCC) and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We analyzed all reported pediatric cases (less than 18 years old) in the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS) and the CHOP PCC of eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. Timeframes analyzed included January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, which were compared to the same timeframes in 2018 and 2019. The data was then characterized by total reported cases per month, and subsequently by age groups of zero to five years, six to twelve years, and thirteen to eighteen years. Out of the separated groups, we evaluated sex, site of reported case, unintentional or intentional ingestion, and reported outcomes. Result(s): The number of reported pediatric poisonings did not vary significantly when comparing each month of 2020 to the previous two years. Sex, intent, and medical outcomes did not vary significantly from year to year or following the implementation of the stay-at-home order.The greatest increase observed was among the age group six to twelve years with site listed as ""own residence,"" or the percentage of reports coming from a home, when comparing the months of March through May in the year 2019 to 2020 on both the local level (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.8-2.6, P<0.0001) and the national level (OR 2.15; 95% CI 2.08-2.23, P<0.0001). This reflects a statistically significant increase in poisonings occurring in the home during a pandemic when compared to the same time in the year previous. Conclusion(s): Following the implementation of stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, total volume of pediatric poisonings reported to both the CHOP PCC and nationally did not increase when compared to previous years. However, the number of exposures listed as occurring in ""own residence"" increased significantly from March through May 2020 when compared to the year prior, particularly in the age group six to twelve years. This is important for emergency physicians to be aware of as many predictions call for ""a second wave,"" as with the usual course of other coronaviruses. Additional stay-at-home orders to help mitigate spread of the virus may occur, along with an increase in school-aged children with reported poisonings.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	"Time critical diagnosis and transfer of patients with acute type a aortic dissection in the United Kingdom - a need to define standards?. Introduction: Type A aortic dissections are a surgical emergency, with roughly 2500 cases per year in England (1). About 20% of patients die before reaching a hospital and about 50% die before reaching a specialist centre, with reported delays in diagnoses in around 16 - 40% of cases (1). There is little knowledge about current logistics and practise by cardiac anaesthetic centres in the UK. We therefore conducted a survey, supported by the Association for Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care (ACTACC) network. Method(s): We sent a 17-question survey to 28 ACTACC link-persons in UK cardiac centres in February 2020. Data was collected and collated using the web-based survey platform ""Survey Monkey"" (Palo Alto, CA). Result(s): The response rate was 68% (n=18). The majority of centres (73%, n=13) shared aortic dissection services with 1-3 other cardiac centres in their region. A majority of centres (n=13, 72%) reported that the maximum duration of ambulance transfer within their region was 90 minutes or less. In the remaining centres travel times were between 2-6 hours. A small majority of the respondents felt that there was often or always a delay in diagnoses and transfer of Type A aortic dissection patients to cardiothoracic centres (n=11, 61% and n=10, 56% respectively). Monitoring and blood pressure treatment of patients with acute Type A aortic dissections were only sometimes or rarely appropriate, as indicated by the majority of respondents with n=12 (67%) and n=15 (83%), respectively. The majority reported that escorting personnel was only sometimes or rarely experienced or trained (n=13, 72%). Half of the respondents assessed handover as often or always appropriate (n=9, 50%). The ideal destination at arrival for patients with acute Type A aortic dissections was the critical care unit in the majority (n=12, 67%) of centres, with 5 centres preferring theatre (28%). There was agreement from respondents that guidelines regarding the transfer of acute Type A aortic dissection patients would be beneficial. Discussion(s): This survey of UK cardiac centres shows that the majority of centres already centralise treatment of Type A aortic dissection patients by sharing responsibilities. Furthermore, it reflects the observation by the majority of ACTACC link persons that there may be room for improvement of a timely diagnosis, transfer times, monitoring, and training and experience of escorting personnel. In the future a national prospective audit of acute Type A dissection cases in the UK will be necessary to further assess timely diagnoses and quality of transfer-related variables in individual patients with the view of elucidating how to potentially reduce the high incidence of pre-hospital deaths of patients with acute Type A aortic dissection. This survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. A future audit would help to assess NHS treatment of acute Type A aortic dissections after the pandemic peak.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Reducing patient harm following inadvertent endobronchial placecement of nasogastric tubes in patients with SARS-COV-2. Introduction: Nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion is essential for enteral feeding but can potentially cause significant injury to the lungs (1). Following a critical incident, we audited our practice of NGT insertion and the consequences of injury in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 caused by the (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Method(s): NGT insertion followed a local standard safety protocol and were inserted by consultants or senior registrars in anaesthesia and critical care medicine, or advanced critical care practitioners. Individual practitioners were able to choose their technique of insertion. All patients had their post-NGT insertion chest x-ray reviewed and those with misplaced NGTs had their case notes reviewed. Early in the outbreak, blind insertion was recommended in our institution to reduce aerosolisation, this was rapidly changed to direct visualisation with laryngoscopy as our experience managing SARS-CoV-2 patients increased. Result(s): During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a total of 135 NGTs were inserted into ventilated and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients. All of NGTs positioned were confirmed by a chest radiograph. Eleven (8.1%) were inadvertently endobronchial, of which four developed pneumothoraces (figure 1). Three patients (including both who had received ECMO) died and a fourth is currently undergoing a prolonged respiratory wean. No patients were fed or received drugs via a misplaced NGT. Chest radiograph of patient with inadvertent NGT placement in right lower lobe. Note the path of the tube suggests breech of the bronchial tree and direct injury to the lung parenchyma (arrowhead). A CT the following day showed a large pneumothorax (arrowhead), some haemothorax (black arrow) and severe ground glass changes consistent with SARS-CoV-2 (white arrow). Discussion(s): Our inadvertent endobronchial NGT rate is relatively high, compared to our previous clinical experience, which we believe may be related to the challenges of working with cumbersome personal protective equipment and/or changed practice to attempt to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (2). We suspect the lung parenchyma is particularly fragile in acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to the high rate of pleural breech and subsequent poor outcome (3). We recommend experienced operators place NGTs and do so using direct or videolaryngoscopy to minimise the risk of incorrect placement. We would like to thank the families of our patients for their permission to share the images in this work.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 and health literacy: The yell of a silent epidemic amidst the pandemic. The emergence of a new form of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exposed weaknesses of health services in several countries, with overcrowding of hospitals, and lack of supplies and professionals in combating the disease, which sometimes contributed to the installation of social, political, and economic chaos. The critical situation experienced made the subject widely publicized so that the current pandemic also deals with an information epidemic. However, the data received and transmitted require prior critical analysis of its content, although not everyone is able to make the necessary judgment before using or sharing information, partly due to the lack of adequate health knowledge. Health literacy is a broad and important topic in public health but still globally underestimated, thus considered a silent epidemic. The exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases shows the world population's inadequacy and difficulty in understanding basic prevention guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic warns of gaps in the health literacy levels of the world population and exposes the need for a comprehensive mapping to identify the overall health literacy status in more countries.Copyright © 2020 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

0	Monitoring life expectancy levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: Example of the unequal impact of the first wave on Spanish regions. Background To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth in Spain and its regions. Methods We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. Results Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.Copyright © 2020 Trias-Llimos et al.

0	Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Male Sex-related Hormones in Recovering Patients. BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may attack testes by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect sex-related hormones and testicular function in recovering patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were separately classified according to the duration of viral shedding (long-term positive vs normal-term group, with the former cases having a duration >50 days) and disease severity (moderate vs severe group). Differences in sex-related hormone levels were compared between groups and linear regression analysis was used to compare the associations of testosterone (T) and estradiol with various clinical and laboratory factors. RESULT(S): A total of 39 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The mean T level was in the normal reference range while the mean estradiol level was above the normal limit. There were no significant differences between the long-term positive and normal-term groups in T (p=0.964), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; p=0.694), luteinizing hormone (LH; p=0.171), prolactin (PRL; p=0.836) or T/LH (p=0.512). However, estradiol was higher in the normal-term group than the long-term positive group (p<0.001). Moreover, there were also no significant differences between the moderate and severe groups in sex-related hormones, duration of viral shedding, or serum biochemical or inflammation indicators. Additionally, regression analyses showed that there were no associations between the T level and the clinical and laboratory factors, while estradiol was negatively associated with the duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION(S): In males infected with SARS-CoV-2, most sex-related hormones (T, FSH and LH levels) remain within the normal reference ranges after recovery from COVID-19, and no significant associations were observed between T level and disease duration or severity. At present, there is insufficient evidence to show that SARS-CoV-2 causes hypogonadism and sterility, but the potential risk should not be ignored.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Psychological Impact During the First Outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy. The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy was confirmed on February 21, 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 turned into a global pandemic, causing a global health emergency, triggering an unprecedented event in the modern era. This study assessed the immediate psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on emotional health and well-being. An ad hoc questionnaire was designed for online completion to expedite data collection during the COVID-19 outbreak. People were invited to participate in the study via social media and email from 4 to 18 March 2020. The entire survey comprised of 21 questions, covering a wide range of factors, such as demographics, disease knowledge, psychological impact, daily life activities, and psychological precautionary measures. The main outcome measure was psychological impact. This was measured based on intensity and prevalence of self-reported feelings of anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, and concern during the epidemic. In total, 10,025 respondents completed the online survey. Of these, about 73% were females, and 100% of the sample possessed good knowledge of the disease. The greatest prevalence of high psychological impact was reported in the <34 years' age group and in north Italy. Additionally, the psychological impact influenced important daily life activities, such as sexuality and nutrition. Our study provides information about the immediate psychological (emotional feelings) responses of Italy's general population to the COVID-19 epidemic. The survey covers several factors that can influence mental health; our results help gauge the psychological burden on the community and offer ways to minimize the impact.© Copyright © 2020 Ferrucci, Averna, Marino, Reitano, Ruggiero, Mameli, Dini, Poletti, Barbieri, Priori and Pravettoni.	false
0	COVID-19 in Cuba: Assessing the national response. The COVID-19 pandemic exhibits different characteristics in each country, related to the extent of SARS-CoV-2 local transmission, as well as the speed and effectiveness of epidemic response implemented by authorities. This study presents a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the daily and cumulative incidence of confirmed cases and deaths in Cuba from COVID-19 in the first 110 days after first-case confirmation on March 11, 2020. During this period, 2340 cases (20.7 x 100,000 population) were confirmed, of which 86 patients died (case fatality 3.67%; 52 men and 34 women). Mean age of the deceased was 73.6 years (with a minimum of 35 years and a maximum of 101), with the average age of men lower than that of women. More than 70% of all deceased had associated noncommunicable diseases. The incidence curve ascended for five weeks and then descended steadily. The average number of confirmed cases and deaths for the last week included (June 23-28, 2020) were 25 and 1 respectively; the curve always moved within the most favorable forecast zone of available mathematical models and the effective reproductive number fell below 1 after the fifth week following the onset of the epidemic. We present the prevention and control measures implemented during this period-some unique to Cuba-and assess their effectiveness using two analytical tools: comparison of observed deaths and confirmed cases with those predicted by mathematical models; and estimation of the effective reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. Some distinctive features of this strategy include nationwide door-to-door active screening for individuals with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory distress, isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts of confirmed cases and of persons suspected of having the virus. During this period, Cuba's response to the epidemic was successful in flattening the curve and limiting transmission, resulting in fewer cases and a lower number of subsequent deaths.Copyright © 2020 MEDICC Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba.

At the start of the UK COVID-19 epidemic, this rare point prevalence study reveals 1/3 of patients in a London inpatient rehabilitation unit were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but asymptomatic (n=15/45). We report on eight patients in detail, including their clinical stability, the evolution of their nasopharyngeal viral RT-PCR burden and their antibody levels over time revealing the infection dynamics by RT-PCR and serology during the acute phase. Notably, a novel serological test for antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (anti-RBD) showed 100% of our asymptomatic cohort remained seropositive between 3 to 6 weeks post-diagnosis.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Cysteine-like Protease Antibodies Can Be Detected in Serum and Saliva of COVID-19-Seropositive Individuals. Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs are based on serum detection of Abs to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralizing Abs) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that is known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of Ags released from infected cells could stimulate Ab responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other nonstructural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titer IgG, IgM, and IgA Ab responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher Ab titers in these assays associated with more-severe disease, and no cross-reactive Abs against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG Abs specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 Ags can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent Ag in infected patients that can be used in serological tests, and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, noninvasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Italian Pediatric Oncology Patients: A Study From the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the Associazione Italiana di Oncologia e Ematologia Pediatrica. BACKGROUND: Little is known as yet about the outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children being treated for cancer. METHOD(S): We collected information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of 29 children (16 female and 13 male; median age, 7 years [range, 0-16 years]) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection while on chemotherapy/immunotherapy (n = 26), or after stem cell transplantation (n = 3) during the peak of the epidemic in Italy. These patients suffered from leukemia (n = 16), lymphoma (n = 3), solid tumors (n = 10), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = 1). RESULT(S): The course of the disease was mild in all cases, with only 12 children developing symptoms (pneumonia in 3 cases), and none needing intensive care. Fifteen patients were hospitalized, including 7 asymptomatic patients. Nine patients (including 5 with no symptoms) were given hydroxychloroquine, and 3 of them were also given lopinavir/ritonavir. Among the 26 patients on chemotherapy/immunotherapy, the treatment was suspended in 16 cases for a median of 26 days (range, 15-68 days), whereas 8 patients continued their chemotherapy and 2 had minor modifications to their treatment regimen. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to take a milder clinical course in children than in adults with cancer. Specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment seems unnecessary for most children. In light of our findings, and albeit with the necessary caution, we suggest avoiding major changes to planned anticancer treatments in pediatric patients acquiring COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	First report of novel coronavirus infection following abdominal organ transplantation in North America during the covid-19 pandemic. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic demands an urgent response from the transplant community in order to protect our vulnerable patient population. We present the rare case of COVID-19 in a combined liver-kidney transplant recipient from the United States. Case Report: The patient is a 77 year-old diabetic woman who presented to our transplant center with decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis. She underwent combined liver-kidney transplant. Postoperatively, her liver enzymes normalized, and she no longer required dialysis. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility 12 days after transplant (POD #12). On POD #13, the patient had rehabilitation sessions with an occupational therapist who later tested positive for COVID-19. This day is presumed to be her first exposure, and subsequent days will be referred to as 'post-exposure days' (PEXD). On PEXD #9 (POD #22), the patient developed a fever of 103 degrees, accompanied by chills and nausea. However, no dyspnea, cough, or respiratory complaints were present at presentation. Other than an elevation in alkaline phosphatase of 168 U/L, her liver enzymes and creatinine were normal (Table 1). Chest CT only showed trace right pleural effusion with no pulmonary infiltrates, no ground-glass opacification, and no consolidation (Figure 1). Abdominal CT revealed a 20 x 15 cm fluid collection surrounding the left kidney graft. Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, but prednisone and tacrolimus were continued. Tacrolimus dosing was adjusted to achieve a target daily through level range of 6 - 10 ng/mL. The following morning (PEXD #10), the patient underwent percutaneous drainage of her perinephric abscess. Her fever and pain subsided following intervention. On PEXD #11, the patient's COVID-19 test resulted as positive. Isolation precautions were maintained. Chest X ray was clear. She had no dyspnea or cough, and she maintained oxygen saturation of 96-100% on room air. A five-day course of treatment with oral hydroxychloroquine at 400 mg was planned, and started on PEXD #11. However, the patient had a significant elevation in liver enzymes immediately following treatment initiation. The drug was discontinued on PEXD #13. The patient's liver enzymes improved following drug cessation. We decided to initiate treatment with azithromycin on PEXD #15, completing a five-day treatment course. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not require oxygen therapy at any point. On PEXD #23 (hospital day 14, POD# 36), the patient was discharged home. MMF was not restarted. Tacrolimus and steroid taper were continued as scheduled. Allograft function and chest imaging prior to discharge were normal. Conclusion(s): Calcineurin inhibitors interfere with the cyclophilins and FKBP required by various coronaviridae for replication. Along with steroids, they also dampen the cytokine storm. The antiviral potential of calcineurin inhibitors and steroids warrants further investigation into their role as viable therapy for COVID-19.	false
0	The status and high risk factors of severe psychological distress in migraine patients during nCOV-2019 outbreak in Southwest China: A cross-sectional study. Background: Psychological distress is highly prevalent among migraineurs during public health emergencies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOV-2019) has created mass panic in China due to its highly contagious by contact and aerosols and lack of effective treatment. However, the emotion status of migraineurs stayed unclear during the nCOV-2019 outbreak. Objective(s): To understand psychological distress of migraineurs by comparing with common population and identify potential high-risk factors of severe psychological distress among migraine patients. Method(s): We enrolled the migraineurs treated at the department of Neurology of West China Hospital and healthy controls with age- and sex-matched to migraineurs. Data on clinicodemographics and psychological distress in the month of February 2020 (during in the nCOV-2019 outbreak in China) were collected. We used the Kessler 6-item (K-6) scale to assess psychological distress. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): The 144 migraineurs and 150 controls were included in the study. Migraineurs showed significantly higher K-6 scores than controls (P < 0.001). Migraine attack frequency in previous 30 days and time spent paying attention to outbreak showed significant in multivariate logistic regression with respective odds ratios of 2.225 (95%CI 1.361-3.628, P = 0.001) and 1.589 (95% 1.117-2.26, P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): During public health outbreaks, healthcare professionals should focus not only on controlling and reducing migraine attack but also on mental health of migraineurs, especially those with high frequency migraine attack.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	"Survey of US Living Kidney Donation and Transplantation Practices in the COVID-19 Era. Introduction: The scope of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) practices is not well defined. Method(s): We surveyed US transplant programs to assess practices, strategies, and barriers to living LDKT during the COVID-19 pandemic. After institutional review board approval, the survey was distributed from 9 May 2020 to 30 May 2020 by e-mail and postings to professional society list-servs. Responses were stratified based on state COVID-19 cumulative incidence levels. Result(s): Staff at 118 unique centers responded, representing 61% of US living donor recovery programs and 75% of LKDT volume in the prepandemic year. Overall, 66% reported that LDKT surgery was on hold (81% in ""high"" vs. 49% in ""low"" COVID-19 cumulative incidence states). A total of 36% reported that evaluation of new donor candidates had paused, 27% reported that evaluations were very much decreased (>0% to <25% typical), and 23% reported that evaluations were moderately decreased (25% to <50% typical). Barriers to LDKT surgery included program concerns for donor (85%) and recipient (75%) safety, patient concerns (56%), elective case restrictions (47%), and hospital administrative restrictions (48%). Programs with higher local COVID-19 cumulative incidence reported more barriers related to staff and resource diversion. Most centers continuing donor evaluations used remote strategies (video, 82%; telephone, 43%). As LDKT resumes, all programs will screen for COVID-19, although timeframe and modalities will vary. Recommendations for presurgical self-quarantine are also variable. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on LDKT practice. Ongoing research and consensus building are needed to reduce barriers, to guide optimal practices, and to support safe restoration of LDKT across centers.Copyright © 2020 International Society of Nephrology"	false

0	Ability of the immune system to fight viruses highlighted by cytometry and T-cell receptor clonotype assessment: Lessons taken before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak. The intriguing aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the high rate of spread and rapid progression of pneumonitis. Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to quickly build the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage of past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor gammadelta cells are in the first line of defense, activated by stress molecules and recognizing some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex-independent but still specific, eg, cytomegalovirus, as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism-both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. Most deaths occur due to pneumonitis, in the course of which overwhelming inflammation impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails and, therefore, patients at risk, mostly the elderly, show higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and enhanced inflammation in the lungs. Apparently, there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype-associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, considering the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these 2 immunotherapeutic tools is understandable based on basic immunology and this knowledge may direct the efforts of the medical community aimed at combating the virus.© Copyright by the Author(s), 2020	false
0	"21 Monitoring the Incidence of COVID-19 Using Syndromic Surveillance of Emergency Department Visits. Study Objectives: COVID-19 was initially detected in Wuhan, China, and has since spread throughout the world. In the United States, Washington State was the first state affected but by March 2020, New York and New Jersey were the two states with the greatest number of cases. We had previously instituted an ongoing syndromic surveillance system (SSS) in 35 hospitals in New York and New Jersey. Our goal was to investigate whether monitoring the respiratory emergency department (ED) visits by syndromic surveillance could be used to follow the incidence of COVID-19 in our area. Method(s): This was a retrospective cohort of consecutive ED visits. It took place at 35 hospitals within 200 miles of New York City from January 1, 2019 through May 15, 2020.Protocol: We identified respiratory visits using a ""RESP"" syndrome filter for patients' chief complaints developed for the New York State Department of Public Health. We used the CUSUM28 Statistic to identify a ""signal"" day. We defined a ""signal"" day as the day when ""RESP"" daily visits exceeded the 28-day moving average plus 3 times the 28-day moving average standard deviation. We also plotted the percent of total ED visits that were ""RESP"" visits. Result(s): The database contained 2,302,432 total ED visits of which 305,512 were ""RESP"" visits. The first signal day in 2020 occurred on March 10. The twenty-eight day moving average of ""RESP"" visits on March 10 and the number of ""RESP"" visits on March 10 were 658 and 953, respectively. The peak number of ""RESP"" visits, 1252, occurred on March 30. See figure for percent of total ED visits for ""RESP"" visits. Conclusion(s): In hospital EDs within 200 miles of New York City syndromic surveillance of ED respiratory visits showed a marked increase in the beginning of March and peaked at the end of March. This mirrored the pattern of COVID-19 cases in our area. Syndromic surveillance of ED respiratory visits may be useful in monitoring COVID-19 in other settings.

0	Available compounds with therapeutic potential against covid-19: Antimicrobial therapies, supportive care, and probable vaccines. The recent outbreak of the COVID-2019 (coronavirus disease 2019) due to the infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has realized the requirement of alternative therapeutics to mitigate and alleviate this lethal infection. These alternative therapies are effective when they are started at the initial stage of the infection. Some drugs that were used in previous other related infections SARS-CoV-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-2012 could be potentially active against currently emerging SARS-CoV-2. This fact imparts some rationale of current interventions, in the absence of any specific therapeutics for SARSCoV-2. It is imperative to focus on the available antimicrobial and adjunct therapies during the current emergency state and overcome the challenges associated with the absence of robust controlled studies. There is no established set of drugs to manage SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, closely following patients' conditions and responding with the dosage guidelines of available drugs may significantly impact our ability to slow down the infection. Of note, it depends upon the condition of the patients and associated comorbid; therefore, the health workers need to choose the drug combinations judiciously until COVID-19 specific drug or vaccine is developed with the collective scientific rigor. In this article, we reviewed the available antimicrobial drug, supportive therapies, and probable high importance vaccines for the COVID-19 treatment.Copyright © 2020 Kumar, Srivastava, Singh, Siddiqui, Mansouri, Abdulhakim, Bin-Jumah, Alkahtani, Abdel-Daim and Uddin.	false
0	Highly sensitive and specific multiplex antibody assays to quantify immunoglobulins M, A and G against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and to characterise immunity to the disease in order to address key knowledge gaps in the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays for IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated their performance using 128 pre-pandemic plasmas (negative controls) and 104 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 5 were asymptomatic, 51 had mild symptoms and 48 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 95.78% at >=14 days and 95.65% at >=21 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.977 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity and their kinetics, required for vaccine development to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	A complex COVID-19 case with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab. Recurrences of COVID-19 were observed in a patient with long-term usage of hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and glucocorticoids due to her 30-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tocilizumab was applied and intended to target both COVID-19 and RA. However, disease of this patient aggravated after usage of tocilizumab. After the discussion of a multiple disciplinary team (MDT) including rheumatologists, antimicrobial treatments were applied to target the potential opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus), which were authenticated several days later via high throughput sequencing. As an important cytokine in immune responses, IL-6 can be a double-edged sword: interference in the IL-6-IL-6 receptor signaling may save patients from cytokine release storm (CRS), but can also weaken the anti-infectious immunity, particularly in rheumatic patients, who may have received a long-term treatment with immunosuppressive/modulatory agents. Thus, we suggest careful considerations before and close monitoring in the administration of tocilizumab in rheumatic patients with COVID-19. Besides tocilizumab, several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can also be applied in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, we also reviewed and discussed the application of these DMARDs in COVID-19 condition.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Adherence to the Gluten-Free Diet during the Lockdown for COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey of Italian Subjects with Celiac Disease. We aimed to assess the perceived impact of the lockdown, imposed to control the spreading of COVID-19, on the adherence of Italian celiac disease (CD) subjects to the gluten-free diet by a web-based survey. A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents. Therefore, the lockdown led to a reported improved adherence to the GFD in one-third of the respondents, in particular in those with previous worse disease control, offering the opportunity to avoid sources of contamination/transgression and increase the use of naturally gluten-free products.	false
0	A review on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: Preface to prevention and management approaches. The novel Coronavirus disease-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, is the most contagious disease of recent years and declared as pandemic by World Health Organization, which rapidly spreads from one person to another mainly by intimate and proximate contact. Although it belongs to same corona virus's family those caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in past decades, it has high transmission and infection rate but a low mortality rate as compared to these past diseases. National Institutes of Health has mentioned that SARS-CoV-2 can easily survive for three hours in droplets to a maximum of three days on different surfaces. Worldwide many pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are conducting clinical trials in search of vaccine and possible therapeutics for the treatment of the disease but currently personal hygiene, frequent hand wash, breaking the chain of infection by social distancing and sanitization are only solutions of COVID-19. Of course, boosting immunity with the help of home-based remedies and traditional system of medicines along with yoga and meditation is the holistic way of getting rid of the COVID-19. Present article reviews the SARS-CoV-19 structure, types, genetic characteristics, symptoms, epidemiology, world statistics, its transmission, prevention, treatment and immunity boosting for the prevention of the disease.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Predictive value of laboratory tests on severity of newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective: To analyze the laboratory tests in newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their predictive values for the severity of the disease. Method(s): 83 patients, including 54 males and 29 females, with median interquartile range of 63(53-70)years diagnosed with covid-19 who were managed by Fujian medical team from January 27, 2020 to February 20, 2020 in Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital were studied retrospectively. According to the severity of the disease, they were divided into common, severe and critical groups. White blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYM), loctate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), serum ferritin (SF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and D-Dimer (D-D) on admission were analyzed retrospectively. And the predictive value of each indicator for critical group was analyzed by Logistic regression. Result(s): On admission, in common, severe and critical groups, WBC (x109/L) values were 7.10+/-3.88, 7.73+/-3.77 and 9.07+/-5.61, respectively (F = 1.315,P=0.274); IL-6 (mug/L) values were 11.76(9.42-15.18), 11.93(10.15-15.63) and 11.24(8.06-13.75), respectively(Z=0.591,P=0.744);D-D (mg/L) values were 0.70(0.48-1.12), 1.67(1.07-7.14) and 1.96(0.71-8.18), respectively(Z=3.363,P=0.186).There were no significant differences among three groups. On admission, in common, severe and critical groups, LYM(x109/L) values were 1.10+/-0.33, 0.80+/-0.35 and 0.66+/-0.32, respectively(F=11.415,P<0.001); SF(mug/L) values were 470.83+/-283.43, 835.66+/-819.43, and 1341.15+/-949.54, respectively (F=7.98,P=0.001); ESR(mm/h) values were 30.76+/-15.70, 42.55+/-22.51 and 51.04+/-25.09, respectively(F=5.181,P=0.008); LDH(U/L) values were 314.71+/-105.46, 325.69+/-109.85 and 444.03+/-181.07, respectively(F=7.17,P=0.001); hs-CRP(mug/L)values were 16(7.20-19.90), 31.00(20.00-87.60) and 80.50(33.70-113.00), respectively(Z=12.185,P=0.002);PCT(mug/L) values were 0.025(0.02-0.05), 0.05(0.02-0.13) and 0.09(0.05-0.39), respectively(Z=9.694,P=0.008). There were significant differences among three groups. Pairwise comparison showed that the LYM value in common group was higher than those in severe and critical groups, and the hs-CRP values in severe and critical groups were higher than that in common group,while SF, ESR, LDH and PCT values in critical group were all higher than those in severe and common groups(P<0.05). Conclusion(s): On admission, WBC, LYM, ESR and LDH are helpful to predict the severity of COVID-19. Although the level of IL-6 is increased, it may not be meaningful to judge the severity of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	Effect of a strict hygiene bundle for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital: a practical approach from the field. Background: During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic it is crucial for hospitals to implement infection prevention strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission to the lowest possible number. This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. Method(s): All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. Result(s): In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees. Conclusion(s): The available data underline that a strict hygiene bundle seem to be associated with a decrease of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the pandemic situation.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	COVID-19 in children: Pathogenesis and current status. BACKGROUND: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, thereare children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to thatseen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. RESULT(S): The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. Ithas become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder diseasebecause of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they canpresent with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.	false
0	Food Insecurity in Tribal High Migration Communities in Rajasthan, India. BACKGROUND: The COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted food supplies across large parts of India, where even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition were widely prevalent. Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULT(S): A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION(S): The study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.	false
0	Prior presumed coronavirus infection reduces COVID-19 risk: A cohort study. Background: Immunological cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses (CCC) and SARS-CoV-2 might account for the reduced incidence of COVID-19 in children. Evidence to support speculation includes in vitro evidence for humoral and cellular cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in specimens obtained before the pandemic started. Method(s): We used retrospective health insurance enrollment records, claims, and laboratory results to assemble a cohort of 869,236 insured individuals who had a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the effects of having clinical encounters for various diagnostic categories in the year preceding the study period on the risk of a positive test result. Finding(s): After adjusting for age, gender and care seeking behavior, we identified that individuals with diagnoses for common cold symptoms, including acute sinusitis, bronchitis, or pharyngitis in the preceding year had a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.75, 0.77). No reduction in the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was seen in individuals under 18 years. The reduction in odds in adults remained stable for four years but was strongest in those with recent common cold symptoms. Interpretation(s): While this study cannot attribute this association to cross-immunity resulting from a prior CCC infection, it is one potential explanation. Regardless of the cause, the reduction in the odds of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 among those with a recent diagnosis of common cold symptoms may have a role in shifting future COVD-19 infection patterns from endemic to episodic.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The first laboratory confirmed case of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Australia was in Victoria on 25 January 2020 in a man returning from Wuhan city, Hubei province, the People's Republic of China. This was followed by three cases in New South Wales the following day. The Australian Government activated the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus on 27 February 2020 in anticipation of a pandemic. Subsequently, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern followed by a pandemic on 30 January 2020 and 11 March 2020, respectively. Laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, is key in identifying infected persons to guide timely public health actions of contact tracing and patient isolation to limit transmission of infection. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current laboratory diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2, including nucleic acid testing, serology, rapid antigen detection and antibody tests, virus isolation and whole genome sequencing. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the different diagnostic tests are presented, as well as their value in different clinical, infection control and public health contexts. We also describe the challenges in the provision of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in Australia, a country with a relatively low COVID-19 incidence in the first pandemic wave but in which prevalence could rapidly change.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia	false
0	Evidence for SARS-COV-2 infection of animal hosts. COVID-19 is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the third virus in the family Coronaviridae to cause fatal infections in humans after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Clinical update on COVID-19. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China prompted an increased surveillance in India since early January 2020. The first laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 in India was reported from Kerala on 30th January 2020. Since then the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) cases have been presenting to the hospital emergencies as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or influenza like illness (ILI). As on 4th June, 2020, about 2,10,000 confirmed cases have been detected in India with around 6,100 reported deaths. The major mode of transmission has been via close contact with infected individuals through respiratory droplets and fomites. The clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic (fever, myalgia, and sore throat) to acute respiratory distress syndrome as a part of cytokine release syndrome. The diagnosis depends on nucleic acid detection by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, IgM/IgG antibodies detection and typical radiological appearance in high suspects. Social distancing, isolation precautions, and proper hand hygiene with good cough etiquettes are all very important infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in mitigating the spread of the contagion. Repurposing of old and existing drugs like hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, interferons have been found to be useful in various trials. Role of convalescent plasma and anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive therapy is also being tried to some effect in cases with cytokine release syndrome. Personal protective equipments form a crucial part of the management of the affected individuals. Vaccine development and trials are being pursued with aggressive vigor worldwide.Copyright © 2020, Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	Immunogenicity and antigenicity of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43. The immunogenicity and antigenicity of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 were studied by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. Three distinct antigens were recognized in both coronavirus strains when Triton X-100-solubilized whole virus was tested by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis against homologous rabbit antiserum. No antigens cross-reacted between strains, but the electrophoretic patterns against homologous antiserum were highly similar in that both strains had one electrophoretically fast antigen, one of intermediate mobility, and one of slow mobility. Immunization of rabbits with 109 plaque-forming units of virus was required for production of antiserum which recognized the three antigens; lesser amounts gave rise to antisera which recognized only one or two components. Precipitin lines excised from two-dimensional immunoelectropherograms were used successfully as immunogens to prepare monospecific antiserum to each of the antigens of OC43 and 229E. Monospecific antiserum to the slow component of 229E neutralized 229E only, and monospecific antiserum to the slow component of OC43 both neutralized and inhibited hemagglutination of OC43 virus. Human convalescent sera which possessed both complement-fixing and neutralizing antibody also recognized the slow-moving component.	false
0	Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on general surgical emergencies: are some emergencies really urgent? Level 1 trauma center experience. PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on general surgical emergencies as well as analyzing the effectiveness of measures taken in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and healthcare professionals. METHOD(S): Patients who underwent emergency surgery between the pandemic period of March 14th to May 15th 2020 and within the same period from the previous year were reviewed retrospectively. COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULT(S): Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n=103) was lower than the control group (n=252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p=0.001, p=0.019, respectively). The rate of mortality was higher in patients who underwent emergency surgery during pandemic (p=0.049). The results of COVID-19 screening were positive in 6 (6/103, 5.82%) patients undergoing emergency surgery. None of the doctors working in the ward were infected with COVID-19 infection (0/20). The screening tests were positive in only two nurses working on the ward (2/24, 8.33%). CONCLUSION(S): In this and similar pandemics, we suggest that a new algorithm is necessary to approach emergencies and the results of this study can contribute to that end.	false
0	Updated experience of a tertiary pandemic center on 533 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection: A prospective cohort study from Turkey. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course and impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on pregnant women. METHOD(S): A prospective cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, and perinatal outcomes were prospectively evaluated. RESULT(S): Of the 533 cases, 161 (30.2%) had co-morbidities and 165 (30.9%) were asymptomatic. Cough (n=178, 33.4%) and myalgia (n=168, 31.5%) were the leading symptoms. In total, 261 patients (48.9%) received COVID-19 therapy, 509 (95.5%) had mild disease, 7 (1.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive mechanical ventilation was necessary in 2 (0.4%) patients. Maternal mortality was observed in 2 (0.4%) cases. Of the patients, 297 (55.7%) were hospitalized, 39 (7.3%) had suspicious radiologic imaging findings, 66 (12.4) had pregnancy complications (preterm delivery [n=22, 4.1%] and miscarriage [n=12, 2.2%] were the most common pregnancy complications), 131 births occurred, and the cesarean section rate was 66.4%. All neonates were negative for COVID-19. The rate of admission to the neonatal ICU was 9.9%. One specimen of breast milk was positive for the infection. CONCLUSION(S): The course of COVID-19 was mild in the majority of cases. However, increased rates of pregnancy complications and cesarean delivery were observed.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Involving Residents Receiving Dialysis in a Nursing Home - Maryland, April 2020. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly in nursing homes once it is introduced (1,2). To prevent outbreaks, more data are needed to identify sources of introduction and means of transmission within nursing homes. Nursing home residents who receive hemodialysis (dialysis) might be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections because of their frequent exposures outside the nursing home to both community dialysis patients and staff members at dialysis centers (3). Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Maryland nursing home (facility A) identified a higher prevalence of infection among residents undergoing dialysis (47%; 15 of 32) than among those not receiving dialysis (16%; 22 of 138) (p<0.001). Among residents with COVID-19, the 30-day hospitalization rate among those receiving dialysis (53%) was higher than that among residents not receiving dialysis (18%) (p = 0.03); the proportion of dialysis patients who died was 40% compared with those who did not receive dialysis (27%) (p = 0.42).Careful consideration of infection control practices throughout the dialysis process (e.g., transportation, time spent in waiting areas, spacing of machines, and cohorting), clear communication between nursing homes and dialysis centers, and coordination of testing practices between these sites are critical to preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in this medically vulnerable population.	false
0	"Disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant communities in the United States. In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began to trickle through global communi-ties, resulting in a pandemic of proportions not seen since 1918. In the US, while the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, initially affected international travelers and their close contacts, it is now ravaging many disadvantaged communities. As in past pandemics, social and economic determinants will strongly influence susceptibility to and health outcomes of COVID-19; thus, it is predictable that low-income and vulnerable US populations will be dis-proportionately affected. Certain ""hot spots"" have already demonstrated high rates of COVID-19-related mortality in minority populations, particularly those of impoverished communities, likely due to increased prevalence of comorbid conditions as a result of unequal socioeconomic factors and inadequate access to timely healthcare [1-5]. We can anticipate similar outcomes in other vulnerable populations, particularly in immigrant communities, which have similar socioeconomic status and rates of comorbidities. With over 46.7 million immigrants currently living in the US, of which 11 million are undocumented [6], a socioeconomic perspective of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic within the US immigrant community is neces-sary. Here, we will focus on the potential impact of COVID-19 on immigrant communities in the US, particularly those in Texas.Copyright © 2020 Clark et al."	false
0	COVID-19 and multiple sclerosis: A description of two cases on alemtuzumab. Background: Alemtuzumab is a treatment for highly active multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is still lack of evidence to guide MS practice. Methods/results: We describe the clinical and immunological evolution of two MS patients under alemtuzumab treatment who were affected by COVID-19, one of them only one week after receiving her last dose, and both recovered without sequelae. Conclusion(s): In selected patients (young, without comorbidities, and with high activity), MS itself could be more dangerous than COVID-19, so we should consider continuing MS treatment as previously planned, including alemtuzumab.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Psychological resilience of COVID-19 frontline warriors: Need of the hour. Background: Amid the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases, risk of infection from patients, isolation, and other factors are taking its toll on the mental health status of the healthcare professionals. The frontline health workers in the COVID-19 pandemic are undergoing psychological turbulence handling the corona situation. Objective(s): The present study assessed the self-reported mental health status of healthcare professionals and studied their perspectives of COVID-19 control. Material(s) and Method(s): A descriptive study was conducted among healthcare professionals in India using a web-based online questionnaire. A total of 152 participants took part in the survey in April 2020. Self-reported mental health status was assessed using the DASS-21 scale. Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests were applied. Result(s): The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 13.82%, 8.55%, and 23.68%, respectively. A higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found in the frontline workers subgroup. The median (interquartile range) scores of frontline workers for depression, anxiety, and stress were 6 (10.5), 6 (8), and 10 (10), respectively. Fifty percent of the participants responded that quarantine and isolation was the best method for control of COVID-19 in Indian setting. Conclusion(s): The psychological disturbance was found among frontline health workers involved in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Psychological debriefing and regular mental status evaluation in addition to psychological counseling may be indispensable.Copyright © 2020 Current Medical Issues  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.	false
0	A Computational Modeling Study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally. Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (beta) and Rt. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8beta, 1.2) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8beta, 1.2) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.	false

Background & objectives: To handle the current COVID-19 pandemic in India, multiple strategies have been applied and implemented to slow down the virus transmission. These included clinical management of active cases, rapid development of treatment strategies, vaccines computational modelling and statistical tools to name a few. This article presents a mathematical model for a time series prediction and analyzes the impact of the lockdown. Method(s): Several existing mathematical models were not able to account for asymptomatic patients, with limited testing capability at onset and no data on serosurveillance. In this study, a new model was used which was developed on lines of susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) to assess the impact of the lockdown and make predictions on its future course. Four parameters were used, namely beta, gamma, eta and epsilon. beta measures the likelihood of the susceptible person getting infected, and gamma denotes recovery rate of patients. The ratio beta/gamma is denoted by R0 (basic reproduction number). Result(s): The disease spread was reduced due to initial lockdown. An increase in gamma reflects healthcare and hospital services, medications and protocols put in place. In Delhi, the predictions from the model were corroborated with July and September serosurveys, which showed antibodies in 23.5 and 33 per cent population, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: The SAIR model has helped understand the disease better. If the model is correct, we may have reached herd immunity with about 380 million people already infected. However, personal protective measures remain crucial. If there was no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at close to 14.7 million, resulted in more than 2.6 million deaths, and the peak would have arrived by June 2020. The number of deaths with the current trends may be less than 0.2 million.	false

Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are among the many groups of people who are in the frontline caring for people and facing heavy workloads, life-or-death decisions, risk of infection, and have been facing various psychosocial problems. So, monitoring mental health issues to understand the mediating factors and inform evidence-based interventions in a timely fashion is vital., Purpose: This study aimed to assess generalized anxiety disorder and its associated factors among HCWs fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia., Patients and Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 HCWs from 20 May to 20 June 2020. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique by allocating a proportion to each health institute. The association between the level of generalized anxiety disorder and its independent variables was examined by ordinal logistic regression. Assumptions for the proportional odds model were checked using parallel line tests. An adjusted proportional odds ratio with a 95% CI was used to calculate the strength of the statistical association between the independent and dependent variables., Results: The prevalence of mild and moderate anxiety disorder among HCWs was 29.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Contact with confirmed or suspected cases (aPOR =1.97; 95% CI: 1.239, 3.132), no COVID-19 updates (aPOR=4.816, 95% CI=2.957, 7.842), no confidence on coping with stresses (aPOR=2.74, 95% CI=1.633, 4.606), and COVID-19-related worry (aPOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.120, 3.056) were positively associated with higher-order anxiety disorder. However, not feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life (aPOR=0.52, 95% CI=0.370, 0.733) and feeling cannot make it (aPOR=0.44, 95% CI=0.308, 0.626) were negatively associated with a higher order of anxiety., Conclusion: The study revealed that the prevalence of anxiety disorder among HCWs was high in the study area. The findings of the current study suggest immediate psychological intervention for health care workers in the study area is vital. Therefore, proactive measures should be taken by the stakeholders at different hierarchies to promote the psychological wellbeing of HCWs in order to control the impact of the pandemic on the HCWs, and containing the pandemic.

0	Recent Biotechnological Approaches for Treatment of Novel COVID-19: From Bench to Clinical Trial. The global spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and increasing rate of mortality among different countries has raised the global concern regarding this disease. This illness is able to infect human beings through person-to-person contact at an extremely high rate. World Health Organization proclaimed that COVID-19 disease is known as the sixth public health emergency of international concern (30 January 2020) and also as one pandemic (12 March 2020). Owing to the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, health authorities focused on discovery of effective prevention and treatment techniques for this novel virus. To date, an effective drug for reliable treatment of COVID-19 has not been registered or introduced to the international community. This review aims to provide recently presented techniques and protocols for efficient treatment of COVID-19 and investigate its morphology and treatment/prevention approaches, among which usage of antiviral drugs, anti-malarial drugs, corticosteroids, and traditional medicines, biotechnological drugs (e.g., combination of HCQ and azithromycin, remdesivir, interferons, novaferon, interferon-alpha-1b, thymosin, and monoclonal antibodies) can be mentioned.	false
0	Diagnostic accuracy of initial chest radiograph compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR in patients with suspected COVID-19. Objective: The chest radiograph (CXR) is the predominant imaging investigation being used to triage patients prior to either performing a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a diagnostic CT scan, but there are limited studies that assess the diagnostic accuracy of CXRs in COVID-19.To determine the accuracy of CXR diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with PCR in patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19., Methods and materials: The CXR reports of 569 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were reviewed, blinded to the PCR result and classified into the following categories: normal, indeterminate for COVID-19, classic/probable COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pathology, and not specified. Severity reporting and reporter expertise were documented. The subset of this cohort that had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other were included for further analysis for diagnostic accuracy., Results: Classic/probable COVID-19 was reported in 29% (166/569) of the initial cohort. 67% (382/569) had PCR tests. 344 patients had CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other. Compared to PCR as the reference test, initial CXR had a 61% sensitivity and 76% specificity in the diagnosis of COVID-19., Conclusion: Initial CXR is useful as a triage tool with a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 76% in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a hospital setting., Advances in knowledge: .Diagnostic accuracy does not differ significantly between specialist thoracic radiologists and general radiologists including trainees following training. There was a 40% prevalence of PCR positive disease in the cohort of patients (n = 344) having CXR and PCR within 3 days of each other.Classic/probable COVID-19 was reported in 29% of total cohort of patients presenting with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (n = 569). Initial CXR is useful as a triage tool with a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 76% in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a hospital setting. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although constitutional and respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever are the most common symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19, gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement has been observed by endoscopic biopsies. Multiple GI symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea or vomiting and abdominal pain, have also been reported. This review aims to present the currently available data regarding the GI symptoms of COVID-19 patients, and to compare the frequency of GI symptoms in early stage (Eastern) mostly Chinese data to the current stage (Western) non-Chinese data., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify both published studies by using PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI (Chinese medical search engine), and yet unpublished studies through medRxiv and bioRxiv. We also reviewed the cross references of the detected articles. We conducted a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search up until 20 September 2020. We pooled the prevalence of symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain by using the Freeman-Tukey's transforming random effect model., RESULTS: A total of 118 studies were included in the systematic review and 44 of them were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant heterogeneity between the studies; therefore, the random effects model was used. The pooled prevalence estimate of any GI symptoms reported was found to be 0.21 (95%CI, 0.16-0.27). Anorexia was the most commonly reported GI symptom at 18% (95%CI, 0.10-0.27) followed by diarrhea at 15% (95%CI, 0.12-0.19). Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and respiratory symptoms were more common in non-Chinese studies. The prevalence of abdominal pain was lower in the ""inpatient-only"" studies when compared with studies that included outpatients only and those including both inpatients and outpatients., CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study, we observed higher rates of diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain in COVID-19 infected patients among non-Chinese studies compared to Chinese studies. We also observed a higher prevalence of GI symptoms in Chinese studies than was reported previously. Non-respiratory symptoms, including GI tract symptoms, should be more thoroughly and carefully evaluated and reported in future studies."	false
0	[Odontologia en entorno COVID-19. Adaptacion de las Unidades de Salud Bucodental en los centros de salud de la Comunidad de Madrid.]. The COVID-19 respiratory manifestations go from mild symptoms similar to those of a common cold to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multiorgan failure. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whose transmission mechanism most relevant to dentistry is through respiratory droplets and possibly also aerosols, as well as direct contact with mucous membranes of the nose, mouth or eye via contaminated hands or objects. The professionals of the dental health units have a high risk exposure since they work at short distances (less than 1 m from the head of the patient) in the oral cavity, where a maximal expression of possible cell receptors for the virus has been reported. Also, most procedures in the dental cabinet imply aerosol generation. Cross-infection is possible during dental care, not only with diagnosed COVID-19-positive patients but also with patients who remain undetected due to asymptomatic or presymptomatic disease. For all these reasons, dental care in the primary health setting has had to change in order to adapt to the pandemic. The changes affect both the appointment scheduling and the care itself and imply the establishment of general and specific barrier protections as well as measures related to ventilation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization, reinforced with additional infection prevention and control measures. This article summarizes the available scientific evidence about this adaptation.	false
0	Assessment of knowledge gaps and perceptions about COVID-19 among health care workers and general public-national cross-sectional study. Background: COVID-19 has impacted everyone's life and livelihood in one way or the other. Individual response to measures taken to control the rapid spread of this disease depend on their knowledge and perceptions. Hence, we proposed to evaluate responses about COVID-19 among the health care workers (HCWs) as well as general public participants (GPPs). Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cross-sectional, observational survey conducted during the peak of the pandemic. The 35-items questionnaire was prepared using Google forms and distributed through e-mails and social media. Result(s): The 1,026 responses comprised of 558 HCWs (54.4%) and 468 GPPs (45.6%). The most reliable source of information was TV news for 43% GPPs, whereas it was HCWs/Local health authorities for 36.8% HCWs. HCWs had sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19, while it was relatively low among GPPs (average correct response 65% and 53%, respectively). Intra-group analysis with respect to age, sex, qualification, and socioeconomic status showed that knowledge about mode of transmission by airborne aerosols was significantly low with respect to qualification among GPPs while younger age group (<40 years) HCWs had significantly more knowledge about mode of transmission and asymptomatic carriers. Paranoia of contracting the infection was significantly higher in GPPs with upper and middle socioeconomic status and younger HCWs. Conclusion(s): HCWs had moderate level of knowledge, whereas GPPs had low to moderate knowledge, with large scope of improvement in both groups. Continued education, both at professional and community level will not only be helpful but also necessary to improve knowledge, avert negative attitudes and control the devastating pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in healthcare worldwide. Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) in infected patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with new-onset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHOD(S): This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. A group with new-onset AF (n = 12) was compared with a control group (total: n = 148, sinus rhythm: n = 118, previous AF: n = 30). New-onset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction. This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events (41.7% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001), bleeding (33.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.005), a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death (58.3 vs. 19.6%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (16.4 vs. 8.6 days, p < 0.001), with no differences in all-cause mortality. RESULT(S): In multivariate analysis, adjusted by potential confounding factors, new-onset AF demonstrated a 14.26 odds ratio for thromboembolism (95% confidence interval 2.86-71.10, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): New-onset AF in COVID-19 patients presumably has a notable impact on prognosis. The appearance of new-onset AF is related to worse cardiovascular outcomes, considering it as an independent predictor of embolic events. Further studies are needed to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing ""de novo"" AF, provide early anticoagulation and minimize the embolic risk of both entities."	false
0	An Overview on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and Other Human Coronaviruses and Their Detection Capability via Amplification Assay, Chemical Sensing, Biosensing, Immunosensing, and Clinical Assays. A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been recognized in patients with acute respiratory disease. COVID-19 causative agent is structurally and genetically similar to SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The drastic increase in the number of coronavirus and its genome sequence have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform bioinformatics and genomics analysis on this class of viruses. Clinical tests like PCR and ELISA for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. However, these techniques are expensive and not readily available for point-of-care (POC) applications. Currently, lack of any rapid, available, and reliable POC detection method gives rise to the progression of COVID-19 as a horrible global problem. To solve the negative features of clinical investigation, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of coronaviruses and describe various amplification assays, sensing, biosensing, immunosensing, and aptasensing for the determination of various groups of coronaviruses applied as a template for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. All sensing and biosensing techniques developed for the determination of various classes of coronaviruses are useful to recognize the newly immerged coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. Also, the introduction of sensing and biosensing methods sheds light on the way of designing a proper screening system to detect the virus at the early stage of infection to tranquilize the speed and vastity of spreading. Among other approaches investigated among molecular approaches and PCR or recognition of viral diseases, LAMP-based methods and LFAs are of great importance for their numerous benefits, which can be helpful to design a universal platform for detection of future emerging pathogenic viruses.

0	Serological reactivity of humans to a Vibrio cholerae common antigen. Over the course of seven pandemics, Vibrio cholerae serotypes have varied. In 1992 the appearance of a new serotype, O139 Bengal, began the eighth cholera pandemic. Several new O139 antigens have been identified, yet a common V. cholerae antigen has not been described. In this study, a monoclonal antibody specific against an 18.7-kDa outer membrane antigen reacted in dotblot analysis with 292 epidemiologically diverse V. cholerae isolates including O1, non-O1, and O139 serotypes. Serum collected from volunteers experimentally challenged with V. cholerae O139, and rabbit antisera to V. cholerae O1, were reactive with the 18.7-kDa antigen by Western immunoblot. This is the first report that the 18.7-kDa antigen is present in V. cholerae O139.	false
0	May 2020: Is It Always COVID-19 No Matter What?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a massive outbreak throughout the world. In this period, diseases other than coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not disappeared; however, it is hard for doctors to diagnose diseases that can mimic the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of COVID-19, especially rare lung diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). We report the clinical case of a young patient who presented to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and clinical symptoms, radiological aspects, and blood tests compatible with COVID-19; two swabs and a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 were performed, both resulted negative, but the respiratory failure worsened. Peripheral eosinophilia guided us to consider the possibility of a rare disease such as AEP, even if radiology findings were not pathognomonic. Therefore, we decided to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the lingula, which showed the presence of eosinophilia greater than 40%. As a consequence, we treated the patient with high-dose corticosteroids that completely resolved the respiratory symptoms. This case report highlights the difficulty of making alternative diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for rare lung diseases such as AEP, which may have initial characteristics similar to COVID-19.

0	Sex differences in clinical phenotype and transitions of care among individuals dying of COVID-19 in Italy. BACKGROUND: Among the unknowns posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the role of biological sex to explain disease susceptibility and progression is still a matter of debate, with limited sex-disaggregated data available. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis was performed to assess if sex differences exist in the clinical manifestations and transitions of care among hospitalized individuals dying with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (February 27-June 11, 2020). Clinical characteristics and the times from symptoms' onset to admission, nasopharyngeal swab, and death were compared between sexes. Adjusted multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinical features associated with male sex. RESULT(S): Of the 32,938 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Italy, 3517 hospitalized and deceased individuals with COVID-19 (mean 78 +/- 12years, 33% women) were analyzed. At admission, men had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (adj-OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adj-OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.29-2.27), and chronic kidney disease (adj-OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.96), while women were older and more likely to have dementia (adj-OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) and autoimmune diseases (adj-OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), yet both sexes had a high level of multimorbidity. The times from symptoms' onset to admission and nasopharyngeal swab were slightly longer in men despite a typical acute respiratory illness with more frequent fever at the onset. Men received more often experimental therapy (adj-OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.74) and experienced more likely acute kidney injury (adj-OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90). CONCLUSION(S): Men and women dying with COVID-19 had different clinical manifestations and transitions of care. Identifying sex-specific features in individuals with COVID-19 and fatal outcome might inform preventive strategies.	false
0	Evaluation of A Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Single Italian Center Study. The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is demanded in laboratories worldwide. We evaluated the performance of a flow immunoassay which can detect IgM an IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 min. Among the 132 positive novel Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) cases, 126 tests were consistent with previous quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Among the 62 negative cases, 60 were consistent with qRT-PCR assays except for 2 cases. In this study, 2019-nCOV/COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device showed 95.5% sensitivity and 96.8% specificity. In conclusion, Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test showed high detection consistency among all analysed samples. Suggesting that could be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, either symptomatic or asymptomatic.	false
0	Remote health service vulnerabilities and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia has highlighted the vulnerabilities of remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in terms of the high prevalence of complex chronic disease and socio-economic factors such as limited housing availability and overcrowding. The response has also illustrated the capability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Sector, working with the government, to rapidly and effectively mitigate the threat of transmission into these vulnerable remote communities. The pandemic has exposed persistent workforce challenges faced by primary health care services in remote Australia. Specifically, remote health services have a heavy reliance on short-term or fly-in, fly-out/drive-in, drive-out staff, particularly remote area nurses. The easing of travel restrictions across the country brings the increased risk of transmission into remote areas and underscores the need to adequately plan and fund remote primary health care services and ensure the availability of an adequate, appropriately trained local workforce in all remote communities.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients: Humoral versus cell-mediated immunity. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed unprecedented pressure on various healthcare systems, including departments that use immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and immunosuppression therapy in organ transplantation units. The true impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on immunocompromised CAR T-cell therapy recipients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) has not yet been established. Case presentation In this report, we compare two patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in either the humoral or cell-mediated immunodeficient states. The first patient was a man in his early 30s who was diagnosed with refractory multiple myeloma. He received fully humanized, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, CAR T-cell therapy before 4 months and achieved strict complete remission. He was infected with SARS-CoV-2 starting on January 26, 2019 and gradually progressed to severe pneumonia. Throughout the clinical progression of the disease, SARS-CoV-2 could not be cleared due to his humoral immunodeficient state. During this period of his severe COVID-19 pneumonia, elevated cytotoxic T-cells were observed in this patient's peripheral blood while elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and ferritin were observed in his cytokine profiles. This patient eventually progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome and recieved non-invasive ventilatory support. He failed to generate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and died of respiratory failure on day 33 (d33). The second patient was a 52-year-old kidney transplant recipient (KTR) who took ciclosporin after renal transplantation for more than 7 years. He confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on January 20, 2019 and gradually progressed into severe pneumonia on d16 with a slightly elevated B-cell percentage and normal T-lymphocyte subsets. Viral clearance occurred together with the generation of specific anti-immunoglobulin G-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 2 weeks of treatment. He was symptom-free and discharged from the hospital on d42. Conclusion We report a CAR T-cell therapy recipient diagnosed with COVID-19 for the first time. His virus clearance failure and life-threating cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that any decision to proceed CAR T-cell therapy during COVID-19 pandemics will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Immunosuppressant treatment based on ciclosporin could be relatively safe for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.

0	Lower limb deep vein thrombosis in COVID-19 patients admitted to intermediate care respiratory units. COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events; however, the reported incidence of deep vein thrombosis varies depending, at least in part, on the severity of the disease. Aim of this prospective, multicenter, observational study was to investigate the incidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound in consecutive patients admitted to three pulmonary medicine wards designated to care for patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia, with or without respiratory failure but not requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Consecutive patients admitted between March 27 and May 6, 2020 were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18-year-old or if compression ultrasound could not be performed for any reason. Patients were assessed at admission (t0) and after 7 days (t1). Major and non-major clinically relevant bleedings were recorded. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Two were excluded due to anatomical abnormalities that prevented compression ultrasound; sixty patients were retested at (t1). All patients were started on antithrombotic prophylaxis, unless therapeutic anticoagulation was required. Deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound was observed in 2 patients (3%); one of them was later deemed to represent a previous episode. No new episodes were detected at t1. One major and 2 non-major clinically relevant bleedings were observed. In the setting of patients with COVID-related pneumonia not requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is low and our data support not screening asymptomatic patients.

0	Kefir: A protective dietary supplementation against viral infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a recently discovered coronavirus termed 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Several scholars have tested antiviral drugs and compounds to overcome COVID-19. 'Kefir' is a fermented milk drink similar to a thin yogurt that is made from kefir grains. Kefir and its probiotic contents can modulate the immune system to suppress infections from viruses (e.g., Zika, hepatitis C, influenza, rotaviruses). The antiviral mechanisms of kefir involve enhancement of macrophage production, increasing phagocytosis, boosting production of cluster of differentiation-positive (CD4+), CD8+, immunoglobulin (Ig)G+ and IgA+ B cells, T cells, neutrophils, as well as cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, interferon gamma-gamma). Kefir can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing expression of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma. Hence, kefir might be a significant inhibitor of the 'cytokine storm' that contributes to COVID-19. Here, we review several studies with a particular emphasis on the effect of kefir consumption and their microbial composition against viral infection, as well as discussing the further development of kefir as a protective supplementary dietary against SARS-CoV-2 infection via modulating the immune response.

0	Laboratory diagnosis of Covid-19 in Africa: Availability, challenges and implications. The COVID-19 infection has been a matter of urgency to tackle around the world today, there exist 200 countries around the world and 54 countries in Africa that the COVID-19 infection cases have been confirmed. This situation prompted us to look into the challenges African laboratories are facing in the diagnosis of novel COVID-19 infection. A limited supply of essential laboratory equipment and test kits are some of the challenges faced in combatting the novel virus in Africa. Also, there is inadequate skilled personnel, which might pose a significant danger in case there is a surge in COVID-19 infection cases. The choice of diagnostic method in Africa is limited as there are only two available diagnostic methods being used out of the six methods used globally, thereby reducing the opportunity of supplementary diagnosis, which will further lead to inappropriate diagnosis and affect the accuracy of diagnostic reports. Furthermore, challenges like inadequate power supply, the method used in sample collection, storage and transportation of specimens are also significant as they also pose their respective implication. From the observations, there is an urgent need for more investment into the laboratories for proper, timely, and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research.

0	Covid-19 in children: A brief overview after three months experience. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) has become a health emergency worldwide. The medical community has been concerned since the beginning of the outbreak about the potential impact of COVID-19 in children, especially in those with underlying chronic diseases. Fortunately, COVID-19 has been reported to be less severe in children than in adults. However, epidemiologic and clinical data are scarce. Children show unique features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement that may account for the low rate of infection and death in this age group. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most relevant evidence of COVID-19 in children highlighting similarities and differences with adults.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Multiple potential targets of opioids in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19. COVID-19 can present with a variety of clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) depending on the host's immune responses and the extent of the associated pathologies. This implies that several measures need to be taken to limit severely impairing symptoms caused by viral-induced pathology in vital organs. Opioids are most exploited for their analgesic effects but their usage in the palliation of dyspnoea, immunomodulation and lysosomotropism may represent potential usages of opioids in COVID-19. Here, we describe the mechanisms involved in each of these potential usages, highlighting the benefits of using opioids in the treatment of ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

0	Quick COVID-19 Healers Sustain Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Production. Antibodies are key immune effectors that confer protection against pathogenic threats. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to ~100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4+ T cells.

BACKGROUND: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cancer are regarded as a highly vulnerable population. Overall, those requiring hospital admission for treatment administration are potentially exposed to a higher risk of infection and worse outcome given the multiple in-hospital exposures and the treatment immunosuppressive effects., METHODS: COVINT is an observational study assessing COVID-19 incidence among patients receiving anticancer treatment in the outpatient clinic of the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano. All consecutive patients with non-haematological malignancies treated with intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular anticancer therapy in the outpatient clinic were enrolled. The primary endpoint is the rate of occurrence of COVID-19. Secondary endpoints included the rate of COVID-19-related deaths and treatment interruptions. The association between clinical and biological characteristics and COVID-19 occurrence is also evaluated. COVID-19 diagnosis is defined as (1) certain if confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS); (2) suspected in case of new symptoms or CT scan evidence of interstitial pneumonia with negative/not performed NPS; (3) negative in case of neither symptoms nor radiological evidence., RESULTS: In the first 2 months (16 February-10 April 2020) of observation, 1081 patients were included. Of these, 11 (1%) were confirmed and 73 (6.7%) suspected for COVID-19. No significant differences in terms of cancer and treatment type emerged between the three subgroups. Prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors was adopted in 5.3%, 2.7% and 0% of COVID-19-free, COVID-19-suspected and COVID-19-confirmed patients (p=0.003). Overall, 96 (8.9%) patients delayed treatment as a precaution for the pandemic. Among the 11 confirmed cases, 6 (55%) died of COVID-19 complications, and anticancer treatment was restarted in only one., CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic peak, accurate protective measures successfully resulted in low rates of COVID-19 diagnosis, although with high lethality. Prospective patients' surveillance will continue with NPS and serology testing to provide a more comprehensive epidemiological picture, a biological insight on the impact of cytotoxic treatments on the immune response, and to protect patients and healthcare workers.

0	Kawasaki Disease and COVID-19. The recent passing away of Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki, who first described what is now known as Kawasaki Disease (KD), and recent reports of a multisystem inflammatory disease in children associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (MIS-C), makes a review on KD and MIS-C timely. Kawasaki Disease is a systemic vasculitis with predilection for coronary arteries occurring mostly in early childhood. The main features are high fever, extensive skin rash, cheilitis with red, cracking, bleeding lips and strawberry tongue, conjunctivitis, erythema and induration of hands and feet, subsiding with periungual peeling, cervical lymphadenopathy, and coronary artery dilation/aneurysms. Treatment consists of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (Ig) plus acetylsalicylic acid. MIS-C is considered a cytokine storm with high fever, inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, that shares features with KD, toxic shock, and macrophage activation syndrome. Many children require admission to paediatric intensive care units for circulatory support. Bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, and enterovirus-causing myocarditis should be excluded. Treatment is not standardized and includes IVIg, IV methylprednisolone and IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors. Copyright © 2020 The Mediterranean Journal of Rheumatology (MJR).	false
0	Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases. Little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases. We explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested on RT-PCR. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, symptoms at onset, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative. SARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet, and may survive for several days. We provided evidence of potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contamination of environmental surfaces.	false

0	Association between HLA gene polymorphisms and mortality of COVID-19: An in silico analysis. INTRODUCTION: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused global public health and economic crisis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a critical component of the viral antigen presentation pathway and plays essential roles in conferring differential viral susceptibility and severity of diseases. However, the association between HLA gene polymorphisms and risk for COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HLA genotypes might impact on the differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 across countries., METHODS: We conducted in silico analyses and examined an association of HLA gene polymorphisms with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 by using publicly available databases., RESULTS: We found that a possible association between HLA-A*02:01 and an increased risk for COVID-19. HLA-A*02:01 had a relatively lower capacity to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens compared with other frequent HLA class I molecules, HLA-A*11:01 or HLA-A*24:02., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that individuals with HLA-A*11:01 or HLA-A*24:02 genotypes may generate efficiently T-cell-mediated antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared with HLA-A*02:01. The differences in HLA genotypes may potentially alter the course of the disease and its transmission. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	GESS: a database of global evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 sequences. The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global emergency since December 2019. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can uncover single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and corresponding evolution patterns. The Global Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 Sequences (GESS, https://wan-bioinfo.shinyapps.io/GESS/) is a resource to provide comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. The database allows user to browse, search and download SNVs at any individual or multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions, or within a chosen genomic region or protein, or in certain country/area of interest. GESS reveals geographical distributions of SNVs around the world and across the states of USA, while exhibiting time-dependent patterns for SNV occurrences which reflect development of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For each month, the top 100 SNVs that were firstly identified world-widely can be retrieved. GESS also explores SNVs occurring simultaneously with specific SNVs of user's interests. Furthermore, the database can be of great help to calibrate mutation rates and identify conserved genome regions. Taken together, GESS is a powerful resource and tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 migration and evolution according to featured genomic variations. It provides potential directive information for prevalence prediction, related public health policy making, and vaccine designs. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	AN EVALUATION OF SEMEN PARAMETERS IN MEN WITH CONFIRMED COVID-19 INFECTION. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the semen parameters of men with COVID-19 infection. Design(s): A prospective study was performed to evaluate the gross semen parameters in men with COVID-19 infection. Samples of saliva and semen were collected and analyzed. Material(s) and Method(s): We included men age 18-70 years old who tested positive for COVID-19. Subjects were contacted about willingness to participate. Packages with sterile specimen containers were mailed to the subject's house with a preaddressed package included to return to our lab. The semen then underwent gross semen analysis for volume, concentration, pH and motility. Result(s): A total of 12 men were enrolled in the study with a median age of 35.5 (IQR = 19.5) (Table 1). The median duration of infection was 37 days (IQR = 21) and 2/12 (16.7%) had associated orchitis symptoms during the infective period. For the 11/12 men who returned a semen specimen, median volume was 1.6cc (IQR = 1.65), median pH was 7.2 (IQR = 0.2), median concentration was 14 million/cc (IQR = 30.25), and median motility of 0% (IQR = 12.5). Conclusion(s): We evaluated 11 men's gross semen parameters after confirmed infection with COVID-19. The median concentration for these men is abnormally low compared to World Health Organization guidelines, and further evaluation is needed to determine the impact that COVID-19 infection can have on the testis and for what duration.

0	The impact of protocol-based high-intensity pharmacological thromboprophylaxis on thrombotic events in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The reported incidence rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infections is high, ranging from 20-60%. We adopted a patient-tailored thromboprophylaxis protocol based on clinical and laboratory presentations for these patients in our institution. We hypothesised that patients who received high-intensity thromboprophylaxis treatment would experience fewer thrombotic events. The aims of our study were to explore the incidence of thrombotic events in this population; to assess independent factors associated with thrombotic events and to evaluate the incidence of haemorrhagic events. A retrospective chart review of all adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the intensive care unit between 1 March and 29 May 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of venous and arterial thrombotic events diagnosed during the intensive care unit stay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the independent factors associated with thrombotic events. A total of 188 patients met the inclusion criteria. All received some type of thromboprophylaxis treatment except for 6 patients who did not receive any prophylaxis. Of the 182 patients who received thromboprophylaxis, 75 (40%) received high-intensity thromboprophylaxis and 24 (12.8%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. Twenty-one patients (11.2%) experienced 23 thrombotic events (incidence rate of 12.2% (95%CI 7.9-17.8)), including 12 deep venous thromboses, 9 pulmonary emboli and 2 peripheral arterial thromboses. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that only D-dimer (OR 2.80, p=0.002) and high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen (OR 0.20, p=0.01) were independently associated with thrombotic events. Thirty-one patients (16.5%) experienced haemorrhagic events; among them, 13 were classified as major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Therapeutic anticoagulation, but not the high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen, was associated with major bleeding. A proactive approach to the management of thromboembolism in critically ill COVID-19 patients utilising a high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen in appropriately selected patients may result in lower thrombotic events without increasing the risk of bleeding.

0	COVID-19 and Mental Health-What Do We Know So Far?. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought several worldwide health, social, and economic disturbances-particularly associated with the imposed confinement measures-that raised concerns about an emerging public mental health crisis. Studies investigating the early mental health impact of the pandemic on general population and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers, revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among others, and found several risk and protective factors. Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being. We encourage the development of longitudinal studies to assess long-term adaptive responses. Copyright © 2020 dos Santos, Pico-Perez and Morgado.	false
0	Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic. The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (n = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (OR = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.

0	Effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pulmonary circulation. The particular scenario of precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has supposed a global health emergency affecting millions of people, with particular severity in the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) could represent an especially vulnerable population because of the high mortality rates reported for respiratory infections. However, the number of COVID-19 cases reported among PAH and CTEPH patients is surprisingly low. Furthermore, the clinical picture that has been described in these patients is far from the severity that experts would expect. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature between patients with PAH/CTEPH and COVID-19, leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and inflammation. In this picture, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays an essential role, being directly involved in the pathophysiology of both clinical entities. Some of these common characteristics could explain the good adaptation of PAH and CTEPH patients to COVID-19, who could also have obtained a benefit from the disease's specific treatments (anticoagulant and pulmonary vasodilators), probably due to its protective effect on the endothelium. Additionally, these common features could also lead to PAH/CTEPH as a potential sequelae of COVID-19. Throughout this comprehensive review, we describe the similarities and differences between both conditions and the possible pathophysiological and therapeutic-based mechanisms leading to the low incidence and severity of COVID-19 reported in PAH/CTEPH patients to date. Nevertheless, international registries should look carefully into this population for better understanding and management.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

0	Imminent risk of covid-19 in diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus patients. Diabetes mellitus is a non-infectious disease and has affected about 425 million adults globally and nearly 15.9 million of them reside in Africa. Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice of preventive measures by the risk group of Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus patients will prevent them from getting infected by COVID-19 and at the same time decrease mortality rates and hence the undiscovered group that is the patients of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus needs to be vigilant regarding safe preventive practices.Copyright © Jyoti Elgiva John et al.	false

Introduction Health risk factors, including lifestyle risks and health literacy, are known to contribute to the chronic disease epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases account for 90% of healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. In the United States, healthcare providers attempt to modulate a limited set of risks. However, chronic diseases continue to proliferate despite expansion of wellness programs and drugs to manage and prevent chronic conditions. Pandemics, exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), show that people in good health suffer mortality rates at 10% the rate compared to those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Healthcare costs and morbidity rates often parallel mortality rates. New root-cause risk and health tools that accommodate low health literacy and are linked to personalized health improvement care plans are needed to reverse the chronic disease epidemic. Reported here is a study on 70 manufacturing employees in the Midwest US using a personalized and group approach to chronic disease reversal and prevention which may also find utility in pandemic severity and policy decisions. Methods Health, lifestyle, behavior, and motivation data were collected on 70 individuals at the beginning of a nine-month disease reversal and prevention program. The data were updated every two to six months over the period. Inputs included information from a novel health risk assessment, serum biomarkers specific for chronic disease, and traditional medical information. Using all these data we generated robust, personalized, and modifiable care plans that were implemented by the participant and guided by a care team including health coaches and medical providers. Periodic renewal of profile data and biomarkers facilitated adjustment of care plans to optimize the path toward health goals set mutually by the participant and the care team. Results Ninety percent of participants experienced a favorable reduction in chronic disease biomarkers. The reduction in serum biomarkers coincided with a reduction in disease and risk attributes based on medical chart data and before and after interviews. Hemoglobin A1C, for example, lowered in all but one participant concomitant with reported improved energy and reduced need for medications in the majority of participants. Markers of inflammation lowered across the population. Most importantly each individual reported improvement in their overall health. Conclusions This simple, inexpensive, root-cause based risk and health approach generates a ""do no harm"" action plan that guides a care team, including the participant, on a path to improved health. The data demonstrate that changes in a novel risk calculator score coincide with changes in sensitive biomarkers for chronic disease. When the risks of an individual are reduced, the biomarkers reflect that change with self-reported wellbeing also improved. This program and process may be of value to society plagued with escalating levels of chronic disease and merits further study and implementation. Copyright © 2020, Lewis et al."	false
0	Reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and enhanced innate immune gene expression in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats. OBJECTIVE: An enigmatic epidemiological feature of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the high rate of asymptomatic infection in pregnant women.1 This is puzzling because systemic immune changes predispose pregnant women to increased severity of respiratory viral infections, especially influenza A.2 A major roadblock in understanding this atypical clinical presentation is the poor characterization of cellular entry factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the androgen-sensitive transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) - in the respiratory tract during pregnancy. Motivated by a recent report showing estradiol-mediated downregulation of ACE2 in the airway epithelium,3 we hypothesized that the hormonal changes of pregnancy will decrease the expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry factors. Here, we compare their expression and examine the innate immune system in the nasal epithelium of term pregnant (gestational day 20) vs. non-pregnant 2-month old female rats STUDY DESIGN: All experiments were conducted after appropriate institutional approval (protocol ID:19-1071) and comply with ARRIVE guidelines. Briefly, nasal epithelia from euthanized rats (n=9 each) were dissected according to the protocol described by Dunston et al. with modifications.4 Collected samples were assayed for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (Ace2, Tmprss2), innate antiviral immune genes that are highly co-expressed with Ace2 (Tnfsf10, Mx1, Nos2),5 and genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 detection and defense (Rig-1, Tlr7, MyD88, Irf7) with TaqMan qPCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.). In addition, we determined the expression of ACE2 (LS-c763699, LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc.; 1:1000 dilution) and TMPRSS2 (sc-515727, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:250 dilution) protein with immunoblots. Finally, we assayed ACE2 enzyme activity with a fluorometric assay (K897-100, Biovision Inc.)., RESULTS: We observed a marked downregulation of the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes (Fig 1A) along with concomitant changes in protein expression (1B), and a significant decrease in ACE2 enzyme activity in the nasal epithelium during pregnancy (1C). Innate immune genes with antiviral function that are highly co-expressed with Ace2 (Tnfsf10, Mx1, Nos2) were significantly elevated in the nasal epithelium from pregnant rats (1D). Similarly, the expression of cytoplasmic (Rig-1) and endosomal viral sensors (Tlr7, MyD88, and Irf7) involved in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were substantially upregulated with pregnancy (1E). Collectively, our results show a decrease in cell entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 and a surprisingly robust expression of innate immune response genes in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats., CONCLUSION: Based on our preclinical findings, we surmise that the high rate of asymptomatic infection in pregnant women is likely due to decreased SARS-CoV-2 tropism secondary to reduced expression of cell entry factors. Our observation of upregulated innate immune defense in the nasal epithelium, in contrast to the immunological indolence at the placental-fetal interface, was unexpected and novel. Considering the exquisite vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza A virus, another single-stranded RNA virus, but not SARS-CoV-2, our findings set the stage for comprehensive characterization of respiratory mucosal immunology in pregnant women to better understand host-pathogen interaction in this unique demographic subset.

0	Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19 Patients: An Inner City Hospital Experience and Policy Implications. BACKGROUND: Although diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure are the key features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the involvement of other organs such as the kidney has also been reported. The reports of the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients vary widely. In this study, we report our unique experience with AKI in COVID-19 patients in a low socioeconomic and predominantly ethnic minority group and provide its incidence, risk factors, and prognosis to expand the current understanding of this complication., METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the data of 469 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18 through April 23, 2020. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory data, and outcomes was collected from the electronic medical records. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality., RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 25-75; range 19-101 years), and 268 (57.14%) patients were male. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation was low (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 207 (44.1%) patients. During hospitalization, 128 (27.3%) patients developed AKI, and the incidence was significantly higher in those patients presenting with a low eGFR (N = 81, 39.1%; p < 0.001). Male sex, hypertension, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, hemodynamic instability, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and admission elevated ferritin, creatinine kinase, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin 1 were identified as the risk factors for in-hospital AKI. Ninety-seven (28.45%) patients died in the non-AKI group versus 91 (71.1%) in the AKI group (p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, hemodynamic status, and PF ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2]/fractional inspired oxygen [FiO2]) determined that on admission, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.48), a low eGFR (HR 1.43; CI 1.1-2.03), AKI stage 1 (HR 1.14; CI 0.64-2.03), AKI stage 2 (HR 1.86; CI 1.03-3.56), and AKI stage 3 (HR 2.1; CI 1.3-2.81) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not improve survival in stage III AKI., CONCLUSION: AKI in our hospitalized COVID-19 patients was common and carried a high mortality, especially in patients with AKI stage 3. RRT did not improve survival. Policy changes and planning for this high incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients and its associated high mortality are necessary at the local and national levels.

0	Antiviral therapies: advances and perspectives. Viral infections cause high morbidity and mortality, threaten public health, and impose a socioeconomic burden. We have seen the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19 that has already infected more than 29 million people, with more than 900,000 deaths since its identification in December 2019. Considering the significant impact of viral infections, research and development of new antivirals and control strategies are essential. In this paper, we summarise 96 antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1987 and 2019. Of these, 49 (51%) are used in treatments against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 4 against human papilloma virus (HPV), 6 against cytomegalovirus (CMV), 8 against hepatitis B virus (HBV), 5 against influenza, 6 against herpes simplex virus (HSV), 17 against hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 1 against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This review also describes future perspectives for new antiviral therapies such as nanotechnologies, monoclonal antibodies, and the CRISPR-Cas system. These strategies are suggested as inhibitors of viral replication by various means, such as direct binding to the viral particle, blocking the infection, changes in intracellular mechanisms or viral genes, preventing replication and virion formation. We also observed that a large number of viral agents have no therapy available and the majority of those approved in the last 32 years are restricted to some groups, especially anti-HIV. Additionally, the emergence of new viruses and strains resistant to available antivirals has necessitated the formulation of new antivirals. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Asthma-associated risk for COVID-19 development. The newly described severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic (Corona virus-induced disease -19, COVID-19). It is now well established that certain comorbidities define high risk patients. They include hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. In contrast, the context with bronchial asthma is controversial and shows marked regional differences. Since asthma is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory lung disease worldwide and SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the upper and lower airways leading to marked inflammation, the question arises about the possible clinical and pathophysiological association between asthma and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Here we analyze the global epidemiology of asthma among COVID-19 patients and propose the concept that patients suffering from different asthma endotypes (type 2 asthma versus non-type 2 asthma) present with a different risk profile in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 and progression to severe COVID-19 outcomes. This concept may have important implications for future COVID-19 diagnostics and immune-based therapy developments. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Optimising the assignment of swabs and reagent for PCR testing during a viral epidemic. Early large-scale swab testing is a fundamental tool for health authorities to assess the prevalence of a virus and enact appropriate mitigation measures during an epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	First COVID-19 Case in Zambia - Comparative phylogenomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 detected in African countries. Since its first discovery in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly worldwide. Whilst African countries were relatively spared initially, the initial low incidence of COVID-19 cases was not sustained for long due to continuing travel links between China, Europe and Africa.. In preparation, Zambia had applied a multisectoral national epidemic disease surveillance and response system resulting in the identification of the first case within 48 hours of the individual entering the country by air travel from a trip to France. Contact tracing showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was contained within the patient's household, with no further spread to attending health care workers or community members. Phylogenomic analysis of the patient's SARS-CoV-2 strain showed it belonged to lineage B.1.1., sharing the last common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from South Africa. At the African continental level, our analysis showed that lineage B.1 and B.1.1 lineages appear to be predominant in Africa. Whole genome sequence analysis should be part of all surveillance and case detection activities in order to monitor the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages across Africa. Copyright © 2020.

0	Application, Verification and Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays with Emergency Use Authorization. Interest continues to grow regarding the role of serologic assays for the detection of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) status to many SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays. In this document, expert recommendations from clinical microbiologist members of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) concerning detailed verification strategies for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with FDA EUA are provided, as are insights into assay limitations and reporting considerations for laboratories. Assessments concerning single and multi-antibody isotype detection assays, which may provide either differentiated or non-differentiated (i.e., total antibody) antibody class results, are addressed. Additional considerations prior to assay implementation are also discussed, including biosafety, quality control and proficiency testing strategies. As the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing is rapidly changing, this document provides updated guidance for laboratorians on application of these assays.

0	Observational study of people infected with SARS-Cov-2, treated with amantadine. BACKGROUND: We conducted an observational study of 15 patients from a Southeastern area of Mexico with symptoms compatible with SARS-Cov-2, which were treated with the antiviral amantadine., METHODOLOGY: In this study, data were collected from 15 individuals with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection, which were treated on an ambulatory basis with 100 mg of amantadine for a period of 14 days., RESULTS: This drug demonstrated its effectiveness, as patients recovered successfully with this treatment without the necessity of attending a hospital to use mechanical ventilation. All patients developed IgG antibodies to SARS-Cov-2., CONCLUSION: Amantadine can be used as a viable and cost-effective alternative for treating people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) on an ambulatory basis, while the vaccine is not available.	false
0	Motivations for social distancing and app use as complementary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic: Quantitative survey study. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is showing negative effects on human health as well as on social and economic life. It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people's motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people's concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. Method(s): This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. Result(s): Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants' motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people's social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants' age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. Conclusion(s): This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute people's motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Concrete implications for future research, public-oriented communication strategies, and appropriate political decisions were identified and are discussed.Copyright © Kai Kaspar.	false
0	Favipiravir at high doses has potent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, whereas hydroxychloroquine lacks activity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus has infected millions of people of which more than half a million succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The urgent need for an effective treatment together with a lack of small animal infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established an infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small molecules on both infection and transmission. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with a low dose of favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, a mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine suggested that the total lung exposure to the drug did not cause the failure. Our data on hydroxychloroquine (together with previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus provide no scientific basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small animal model. Clinical studies are required to assess whether a similar antiviral effect is achievable in humans without toxic effects. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.	false
0	"Psychological distress surveillance and related impact analysis of hospital staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing, China. BACKGROUND: Hospital staff are vulnerable and at high risk of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. The aim of this study was to monitor the psychological distress in hospital staff and examine the relationship between the psychological distress and possible causes during the COVID-19 epidemic., METHODS: An online survey was conducted from February 1 to February 14, 2020. Hospital staff from five national COVID-19 designated hospitals in Chongqing participated. Data collected included demographics and stress responses to COVID-19: 1) the impact of event scale to measure psychological stress reactions; 2) generalizedanxietydisorder 7 to measure anxiety symptoms; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire 9 to measure depression symptoms; 4) Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale to measure obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS); and 5) Patient Health Questionnaire 15 to measure somatization symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that were correlated with psychological distress., RESULTS: Hospital staff that participated in this study were identified as either doctors or nurses. A total of 456 respondents completed the questionnaires with a response rate of 91.2%. The mean age was 30.67 +/- 7.48 years (range, 17 to 64 years). Of all respondents, 29.4% were men. Of the staff surveyed, 43.2% had stress reaction syndrome. The highest prevalence of psychological distress was OCS (37.5%), followed by somatization symptoms (33.3%), anxiety symptoms (31.6%), and depression symptoms (29.6%). Univariate analyses indicated that female subjects, middle aged subjects, subjects in the low income group, and subjects working in isolation wards were prone to experience psychological distress. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" (odds ratio [OR], 5.192; 95%CI, 2.396-11.250; P < .001), ""Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family"" (OR, 2.099; 95%CI, 1.299-3.391; P = .002) ""Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures"" (OR, 1.583; 95%CI, 1.061-2.363; P = .025), and""Social support"" (OR, 1.754; 95%CI, 1.041-2.956; P = .035) were correlated with psychological reactions. ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" and ""Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family"" were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Anxiety (OR, 3.622; 95% CI, 1.882-6.973; P < .001; OR, 1.803; 95% CI, 1.069-3.039; P = .027), OCS (OR, 5.241; 95% CI, 2.545-10.793; P < .001; OR, 1.999; 95% CI, 1.217-3.282; P = .006) and somatization (OR, 5.177; 95% CI, 2.595-10.329; P < .001; OR, 1.749; 95% CI, 1.051-2.91; P = .031). ""Stigmatization and rejection in neighborhood because of hospital work"", ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" and ""Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures"" were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Depression(OR, 2.297; 95% CI, 1.138-4.637; P = .020; OR, 3.134; 95% CI, 1.635-6.006; P = .001; OR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.075-2.517; P = .022)., CONCLUSIONS: Hospital staff showed different prevalence of psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study confirmed the severity of negative psychological distress on hospital staff and identified factors associated with negative psychological distress that can be used to provide valuable information for psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

0	Emergence and Evolution of Olfactory and Gustatory Symptoms in Patients with COVID-19 in the Outpatient Setting. The present study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of general and sinonasal symptoms in patients with olfactory symptoms and mild coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and determining the patterns in emergence and resolution of olfactory/gustatory symptoms relative to general and sinonassal symptoms. This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted at the outpatient otorhinolaryngology clinic at a COVID-19-designated referral Hospital. We included consecutive patients with new-onset olfactory dysfunction and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of COVID-19. We asked the patients to fill in a questionnaire about general and sinonasal symptoms in association with anosmia, hyposmia or hypogeusia, and recorded the time course of the olfactory/gustatory symptoms during 2-weeks of follow-up. 76 patients with average age of 38.5 +/- 10.6 years were included. Majority of participants (94.7%) had general or sinonasal symptom. There was anosmia in 60.5% and hyposmia in 39.5%, with sudden onset of olfactory symptoms reported in 63.2% of patients. During the follow-up, 30.3% of patients completely and 44.7% partially recovered from anosmia/hyposmia. Regardless of whether the general or olfactory symptoms appeared initially, the general symptoms resolved first while a degree of olfactory dysfunction persisted during the follow-up. Our study showed that hyposmia and anosmia in mild COVID-19 are frequently associated with general and sinonasal symptoms and tend to persist longer than the general and sinonasal symptoms during the course of the disease.

0	Pattern of liver function and clinical profile in COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of 91 patients. BACKGROUND: - COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to myriad range of organ involvement including liver dysfunction., AIM: To analyse the liver function in patients with COVID-19 and their association with respect to age, sex, severity of disease and clinical features., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study done at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi. 91 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study and divided into asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe groups. Liver function tests were compared among different severity groups., RESULTS: Of 91 patients with COVID-19, 70 (76.9%) had abnormal liver function. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin levels was 1-2 x ULN in 33(36.3%), 34(37.3%), 12(13.2%), 6(6.6%) cases and >2 x ULN in 20(22%), 18(19.8%), 7(7.7%) and 2 (2.2%) cases respectively. Mean AST and ALP levels among different severity groups of COVID-19 was statistically significant (p < 0.05) whereas mean ALT and total bilirubin levels was statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference between males and females with regard to abnormal liver function. Liver injury was seen in 64.3% cases of hypertension and 73.3% cases of diabetes. Fever, myalgia, headache and breathlessness were found to be correlated significantly with severity of disease., CONCLUSION: Liver injury is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and is more prevalent in the severe disease group. Aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase are better indicators of covid-19 induced liver injury than alanine transaminase and total bilirubin. Copyright © 2020.

0	Characteristics and short-term obstetric outcomes in a case series of 67 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Stockholm, Sweden. INTRODUCTION: The Stockholm region was the first area in Sweden to be hit by the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our national guidelines regarding care of women with positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (detection with polymerase chain reaction) recommend individualized antenatal care, mode of delivery based on obstetric considerations, and no routine separation of the mother and newborn after birth. Breastfeeding is encouraged, and although there is no specific recommendation on wearing a face mask to prevent viral transmission to the newborn while nursing, instructions are given to keep high hygiene standards. All studies based on cases tested due to hospital admittance, including our, will capture more women with pregnancy complications than in the general population. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics in 67 SARS-CoV-2 positive women and their 68 neonates, and to report short-term maternal and neonate outcomes., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case series with data from medical records including all test-positive women (n=67) who gave birth from March 19 to April 26, 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden. Means, proportions and percentages were calculated for characteristics and outcomes., RESULTS: The mean age was 32 years, 40% were nulliparous, and 61% were overweight or obese. Further, 15% had diabetes and 21% a hypertensive disease. 70% of the women had a vaginal birth. Preterm delivery occurred in 19% of the women. The preterm deliveries were mostly medically indicated, including two women who were delivered preterm due to severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) illness, corresponding to 15% of the preterm births. Four women (6%) were admitted to intensive care unit postpartum. Three neonates were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 after birth., CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 67 test-positive women with clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to manifest COVID-19 disease few women presented with severe COVID-19 illness, a majority had a vaginal birth at term with a healthy neonate that were test-negative for SARS-CoV-2.

0	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Children's Hospital in New York City: Patient Characteristics and an Institutional Protocol for Evaluation, Management, and Follow-Up. OBJECTIVES: The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, known as coronavirus disease 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic. Reports are emerging of a new severe hyperinflammatory syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 in children and adolescents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated this disease multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Our objective was to develop a clinical inpatient protocol for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with this syndrome., DATA SOURCES: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team based on relevant literature related to coronavirus disease 2019, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and related inflammatory syndromes, as well as our experience caring for children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Data were obtained on patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children at our institution from the pre-protocol and post-protocol periods., DATA SYNTHESIS: Our protocol was developed in order to identify cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with high sensitivity, stratify risk to guide treatment, recognize co-infectious or co-inflammatory processes, mitigate coronary artery abnormalities, and manage hyperinflammatory shock. Key elements of evaluation include case identification using broad clinical characteristics and comprehensive laboratory and imaging investigations. Treatment centers around glucocorticoids and IV immunoglobulin with biologic immunomodulators as adjuncts. Multidisciplinary follow-up after discharge is indicated to manage continued outpatient therapy and evaluate for disease sequelae. In nearly 2 months, we admitted 54 patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, all of whom survived without the need for invasive ventilatory or mechanical circulatory support. After institution of this protocol, patients received earlier treatment and had shorter lengths of hospital stay., CONCLUSIONS: This report provides guidance to clinicians on evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with a novel hyperinflammatory syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. It is based on the relevant literature and our experience. Instituting such a protocol during a global pandemic is feasible and is associated with patients receiving treatment and returning home more quickly.	false
0	Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in a patient receiving Infliximab therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a newly described condition. It has a spectrum of presentations proposed to occur as part of a post-infectious immune response. We report the first case of PIMS-TS in a child on established anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) therapy; a 10 year-old girl with ulcerative colitis treated with infliximab. The patient had 6-weeks of daily fever with mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal, renal and hematologic involvement. Biomarkers of hyperinflammation were present including: hyperferritinaemia (up to 691 micro /L; normal 15-80 micro g/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) (>100mg/L for >10 days, normal 0-5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) consistently >100mm/hr (normal 0-15 mm/hr), raised white cell count with neutrophilia, elevated D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), anaemia and Mott cells on bone marrow analysis. Extensive investigations for alternative diagnoses for pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) were negative. The condition was refractory to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but improved within 24hrs of high dose methylprednisolone. Infliximab treatment followed and the patient has remained well at follow up. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Current series report such negative findings in up to half of cases. The patient experienced a milder clinical phenotype without cardiac involvement, shock or organ failure. Accepting the wide spectrum of PIMS-TS presentations, it is possible that prior anti-TNF-alpha therapy may have attenuated the disease course. Given the uncertainty around therapeutic strategies for PIMS-TS this case supports the need for further investigation into continuing infliximab as a treatment option for the condition.

0	Evaluation of a genetic risk score for severity of COVID-19 using human chromosomal-scale length variation. INTRODUCTION: The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown. One possibility is that genetic variation is partly responsible for the highly variable response. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosomal-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: We compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age-matched patients drawn for the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers characterizing the chromosomal-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe reaction to COVID-19 based only on their 88-number classification., RESULTS: We found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a significant level (p = 2 . 10-11) as measured against a randomized control and (p = 3 . 10-14) as measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC = 0.5). However, we found that the AUC of the classifier was only 0.51, too low for a clinically useful test., CONCLUSION: Genetics play a role in the severity of COVID-19, but we cannot yet develop a useful genetic test to predict severity.	false
0	Predictive value of CT in the short-term mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in nonelderly patients: A case-control study. Rationale and objectives: Identifying CT predictors of mortality in nonelderly healthy patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will aid to distinguish the most vulnerable patients in this age group and thus alter the management. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of multiple CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia on initial presentation in nonelderly patients without underlying medical conditions. Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, thirty laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with no known major underlying disease who underwent a chest CT scan and expired of pneumonia within the following 30 days after admission, were included as case group. Sixty control subjects individually matched on their age, gender, without underlying medical conditions, who received same-criteria standard care and were discharged from the hospital in 30-day follow-up were included in the control group. A conditional logistic regression model was applied. Result(s): Applying a univariate conditional logistic regression model, it was revealed that bilateral lung disease, anterior involvement, central extension, GGO, consolidation, air bronchograms, pleural effusion, BMI >= 25 kg/m2 and CT severity score were the significant preliminary predictors (all p-values < 0.05). Next, by applying a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, it was determined that the CT severity score is the only statistically significant CT predictor of mortality (Odds Ratio = 1.99, Confidence Interval: 1.01-4.06, p-value < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis revealed a score of 7.5 as the cut-off point of CT severity score with the highest sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.87). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that CT severity score is a reliable predictor factor of mortality in nonelderly previously healthy individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia. Assessment of disease extension in addition to the morphological pattern is necessary for CT reports of COVID-19 patients. This may alert the clinicians to alter the management for this specific group of patients, even when they are clinically silent or have a mild presentation.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Ad26 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunogen induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses. Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-gamma. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasopharynx according to clinical phenotype of affected patients. Objectives: Duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the upper respiratory tract is extremely variable, but its relation to disease severity is unknown. We investigated this relation in the 530 000 inhabitants of the northeastern Italian province of Udine. Method(s): We analysed real-time RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens conducted at the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Udine, Italy (which serves the whole province) from 1 March to 30 April 2020 Specimens were from positive individuals in four groups characterized by different disease severity (critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, patients admitted to infectious disease units, symptomatic patients visiting the emergency department and not hospitalized, and asymptomatic individuals tested during contact tracing or screening activities). Duration of viral positivity was assessed from the first positive test to the day of the first of two consecutive negative tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the four groups. Result(s): From 1 March to 30 April, 39 483 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted on 23 778 individuals, and 974 individuals had a positive test result. Among those with multiple tests (n = 878), mean time to negativity was 23.7 days (standard error 0.3639; median 23, interquartile range 16-30 days). Mean time to negativity was longer in the group admitted to the intensive care unit than in the others, whereas no difference was observed between asymptomatic patients and those with mild disease. Conclusion(s): Disease control measures should not be adjusted to account for differences in viral shedding according to symptomatic status.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false
0	METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS. SESSION TITLE: Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: In December 2019, a SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory failure syndrome Coronavirus- 2) virus emerged from Wuhan, China causing SARS and other pulmonary infections (COVID-19) that rapidly spread to other parts of the world, causing a major pandemic. There is data suggesting that this virus will follow similar trends as the 2009 Influenza H1N1 and 2002 SARS-COV, due geographical and meteorological factors, being the most importants the temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. We aim to analyze the impact of geographical and meteorological factors in the incidence of COVID19. METHOD(S): We analyzed the frequency of COVID19 cases along geographical and meteorological data from 84 regions around the world from January to March 2020, we divided the regions if they had less than 1, 000 cases vs more than 1, 000 cases of COVID-19. The meteorological data was collected from the Climate Re-analyzer platform from the Climate Change Institute at University of Maine, the National Science foundation and Russell Grinnell Memorial Trust. The monthly incidence of the cases was collected by the Mapping 2019-nCOV tool from the Center of Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. We compare the temperature (degree Celsius), latitude (degree North and degree South), humidity (%) wind speed (km/h) and wind direction (0degree-360degree) between areas with above 1, 000 cases of COVID19 vs areas with less than 1, 000 cases. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square, and a univariate linear regression model was created. We used SPSS version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) for statistical analysis. RESULT(S): We found 84 regions around the world affected by COVID-19 from January 1st to March 1st, 2020. Regions with more that 1, 000 COVID-19 cases were more likely to have lower minimum temperature (5.05degreeC vs 9.18degreec; P: <0.05), lower maximum temperature (6.22degreeC vs 7.97degreeC; P:<0.05), no difference in wind direction, higher maximum wind speed (3.29km/h vs 2.36km/h; P:<0.05), no difference between average humidity, and to be located above 30 degrees in north latitude (32% vs 11%; P<0.05) presented more cases. See table 1 and table 2. CONCLUSION(S): Regions with more than one thousand cases were statistically significantly more likely to have minimum average temperature of -0.3 degree Celsius, maximum wind speed 14.85 km / h, humidity average of 75.65% and with a latitude greater than 30 degree north. Furthers studies with larger sample are needed to assess the geographical and meteorological impact in COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: COVID19, Pandemic, meteorological data.

0	Establishment of replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based recombinant viruses suitable for SARS-CoV-2 entry and neutralization assays. Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based recombinant viruses are useful tools for studying emerging and highly pathogenic enveloped viruses in level 2 biosafety facilities. Here, we used a replication-competent recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) encoding the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in place of the original G glycoprotein (rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) to develop a high-throughput entry assay for SARS-CoV-2. The S protein was incorporated into the recovered rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 particles, which could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 also displayed entry characteristics similar to the wild type virus, such as cell tropism and pH-dependence. The neutralizing titers of antibodies and sera measured by rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 were highly correlated with those measured by wild-type viruses or pseudoviruses. Therefore, this is a safe and convenient screening tool for SARS-CoV-2, and it may promote the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection serology validation of different methods: Usefulness of IgA in the early phase of infection. Background and aims: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from the respiratory samples of patients with pneumonia as showed by the sequence analysis of the virus genomes obtained in Wuhan, China. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies and for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. Material(s) and Method(s): We tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Result(s): The ECLIA serological assay performed best and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. Conclusion(s): The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Clinical manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19 in the paediatric population: a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected hundreds of thousands of people. We aim to report the distribution of cases, prevalence, and clinical, radiological, and laboratory signs and outcomes of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Moreover, we intend to evaluate neonatal clinical outcomes. Hence, our age range of interest is 0 to 19 years., METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database to identify papers published between 1 December 2019 and 9 April 2020 on COVID-19., RESULTS: The search identified 27 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population accounts for a small percentage of patients, whose clinical signs and symptoms are often milder than those of adults. Despite better prognosis and low mortality in children, the disease can progress to severe pneumonia in some cases, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Children are likely to become a hidden source of infection because of their atypical presentation, and they may play a role in community transmission, leading to unfavourable outcomes. There is little evidence about intrauterine vertical transmission. As no vaccine or specific antiviral is currently available, management plans include supportive treatment., CONCLUSION: As compared with that in adults, the presentation of COVID-19 in children is mild and has a better prognosis. Sufficient evidence regarding the probability of intrauterine vertical transmission could not be found, and further studies need to be conducted to establish this relationship.	false
0	Impact of COVID19 Pandemic on the Incidence and Management of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Presenting with Acute Myocardial Infarction in England. Background Studies have reported significant reduction in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) related hospitalizations during the COVID19 pandemic. However, whether these trends are associated with increased incidence of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in this population is unknown. Methods and Results AMI hospitalizations with OHCA during the COVID19 period (1st February-14th May 2020) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project and British Cardiovascular Intervention Society datasets were analysed. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson models with equivalent pre-COVID19 period (1st February-14th May 2019) as reference. AMI hospitalizations during COVID19 period were reduced by more than 50% (n=20,310 vs n=9,325). OHCA was more prevalent during the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID period (5.6% vs. 3.6%), with a 56% increase in the incidence of OHCA (incidence rate ratio: 1.56, 95%CI 1.39-1.74). OHCA patients during COVID19 period were likely to be older, female, of Asian ethnicity and more likely to present with STEMI. The overall rates of invasive coronary angiography (58.4% vs. 71.6%, p<0.001) were significantly lower amongst the OHCA during COVID19 period with increased time to reperfusion (mean 2.1 hours vs. 1.1 hours, p=0.05) in STEMI. The adjusted in-hospital mortality probability increased from 27.7% in February 2020 to 35.8% in May 2020 in the COVID19 group (p <0.001). Conclusions In this national cohort of hospitalized AMI patients, we observed a significant rise in incidence of OHCA during COVID period paralleled with reduced access to guidelines recommended care and increased in-hospital mortality.	false
0	Internet search volume for chest pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a reduction in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction. This manuscript presents the analysis of Google Trends meta-data and shows a marked spike in search volume for chest pain that is strongly correlated with COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. This raises a concern that fear of contracting COVID-19 may be leading patients to self-triage using internet searches. Research Letter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians worldwide have noted reductions in hospital admissions for emergencies including acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.1,2 Several explanations have been proposed including reduced air pollution, changes in diet and lifestyle, or, most worryingly, avoidance of hospitals to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.3 There is significant concern that instead of presenting to hospital, fear of COVID-19 has led patients to self-triage using internet searches. Google Trends TM is a free publicly available tool that monitors how often search items are queried over time and provides insights into public health behavior. Recommendations for the documentation of Google Trends TM analyses have previously been published4 and were consulted to facilitate reproducibility of the present study. We quantified searches in the United States (US) for the symptom of interest, chest pain, and the control terms toothache, abdominal pain, knee pain, heart attack and stroke (time period 1st Jan 2017 to 24th May 2020, accessed 28th May 2020, no quotation marks, no combination symbols, all query categories). Data on the number of COVID-19 cases per day in the US was retrieved from USAFacts.org, which collates data from government agencies and is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Time-lag correlation analysis was performed using R. To assess the relationship between chest pain searches and COVID-19 caseload, data on search volume was also collected for the states with the highest and lowest numbers of COVID-19 cases. No extramural funding was used to support this work. The number of cases of COVID-19 in the US rose rapidly throughout March 2020 and during the same month the relative search frequency of the symptom chest pain, but not the control terms, nearly doubled compared to the previous three years (Figure 1A). There was a strong correlation between the number of new COVID-19 cases and Google search queries for chest pain (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.79 with 18-day time-lag) (Figure 1B). The search volume for chest pain also spiked in the states with the three highest (New York, New Jersey, Illinois), but not the three lowest (Hawaii, Montana, Alaska), COVID-19 caseloads (Figure 2). In this analysis we describe a strong correlation between the increase in COVID-19 cases and the utilization of Google for medical information. Chest pain is a common presenting symptom of life-threatening medical conditions including coronary artery disease, aortic dissection and pulmonary embolus, but is not a common symptom of COVID-19.5 The analysis presented here suggests that the rise in COVID-19 cases has led patients to seek medical information about their symptoms from the internet at substantially higher rates compared to the previous three years. This does not appear to be due to generally increased search volumes nor seasonal variation (Figure 1). Within the US this was observed in states with a high prevalence of COVID-19 but not states with a low prevalence (Figure 2). This was despite all analyzed states instituting stay-at-home orders, which suggests this phenomenon is not related to lockdown restrictions. This raises a significant concern that in regions where caseloads are high, fear of contracting COVID-19 may be leading patients to self-triage, potentially in lieu of presenting to hospital. The rise in search volume for 'chest pain' but not 'heart attack' or 'stroke' may be explained by several hypotheses, including patients being more likely to search for symptoms rather than diagnoses, or it may reflect the reduced hospitalisations for these conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and hence fewer patients receiving the diagnostic labels 'heart attack' and 'stroke'. Indeed it was recently reported that the rate of catheter laboratory activation for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has decreased by 38% in the US compared to the pre-COVID-19 period,1 and there have been similar reductions in hospital presentations for other life-threatening conditions such as acute aortic dissection.6 This has been accompanied by a concurrent increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests7 and, amongst patients that did present to hospital with acute myocardial infarction, increased rates of delayed presentation and complications.8 While COVID-19 has a mortality of approximately 1%,9 acute myocardial infarction in the absence of contemporary treatment has a one-month mortality of up to 50%.10 As lockdown regulations begin to relax worldwide there is a significant risk of a second-wave of COVID-19, and so it is critical to re-emphasize to patients that internet searches are not an alternative to professional medical attention.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in London, England: changes to community point prevalence around lockdown time, March-May 2020. BACKGROUND: The UK has been one of the European countries most affected by COVID-19 pandemic. The UK implemented a lockdown in March 2020, when testing policy at the time was focusing on hospitalised cases. Limited information is therefore available on the impact of the lockdown on point prevalence in the community. We assessed COVID-19 point prevalence in London between early April and early May 2020, which approximately reflect infection around the time of the lockdown and 3-5 weeks into lockdown., METHODS: We tested 1064 participants of a community surveillance cohort for acute COVID-19 infection using PCR in London in April and May 2020 and described positivity as well as characteristics and symptoms of the participants., RESULTS: Point prevalence decreased from 2.2% (95% CI 1.4 to 3.5) in early April to 0.2% (95% CI 0.03 to 1.6) in early May. 22% of those who tested positive in April were asymptomatic. Extrapolation from reports of confirmed cases suggest that 5-7.6% of total infections were confirmed by testing during this period., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 point prevalence in the community sharply decreased after lockdown was implemented. This study is based on a small sample and regular seroprevalence studies are needed to better characterise population-level immunity. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Hospital caseload demand in the presence of interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A modeling study. A surge in hospital admissions was observed in Japan in late March 2020, and the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) temporarily reduced from March to May as a result of the closure of host and hostess clubs, shortening the opening hours of bars and restaurants, and requesting a voluntary reduction of contact outside the household. To prepare for the second wave, it is vital to anticipate caseload demand, and thus, the number of required hospital beds for admitted cases and plan interventions through scenario analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the first wave data by age group so that the age-specific number of hospital admissions could be projected for the second wave. Because the age-specific patterns of the epidemic were different between urban and other areas, we analyzed datasets from two distinct cities: Osaka, where the cases were dominated by young adults, and Hokkaido, where the older adults accounted for the majority of hospitalized cases. By estimating the exponential growth rates of cases by age group and assuming probable reductions in those rates under interventions, we obtained projected epidemic curves of cases in addition to hospital admissions. We demonstrated that the longer our interventions were delayed, the higher the peak of hospital admissions. Although the approach relies on a simplistic model, the proposed framework can guide local government to secure the essential number of hospital beds for COVID-19 cases and formulate action plans.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Association of procalcitonin levels with the progression and prognosis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first announced in Wuhan, and has rapidly evolved into a pandemic. However, the risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are yet to be described in detail. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the information of 1525 cases from the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were generated to explore the relationship between procalcitonin (PCT) level and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between disease severity in hospitalized patients and their PCT levels. Survival curves and the cumulative hazard function for COVID-19 progression were conducted in the two groups. To further detect the relationship between the computed tomography score and survival days, curve-fitting analyses were performed. Result(s): Patients in the elevated PCT group had a higher incidence of severe and critical severity conditions (P < 0.001), death, and higher computed tomography (CT) scores. There was an association between elevated PCT levels and mortality in the univariate ((hazard ratio [1], 3.377; 95% confidence interval [2], 1.012-10.344; P = 0.033) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR, 4.933; 95% CI, 1.170-20.788; P = 0.030). Similarly, patients with elevated PCT were more likely to have critically severe disease conditions in the univariate (odds ratio [2], 7.247; 95% CI, 3.559-14.757; P < 0.001) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR, 10.679; 95% CI, 4.562-25.000; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed poorer prognosis for patients with elevated PCT (P = 0.024). The CT score 1 for patients with elevated PCT peaked at day 40 following the onset of symptoms then decreased gradually, while their total CT score was relatively stable. Conclusion(s): PCT level was shown as an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Compared with inpatients with normal PCT levels, inpatients with elevated PCT levels had a higher risk for overall mortality and critically severe disease. These findings may provide guidance for improving the prognosis of patients with critically severe COVID-19.Copyright © The author(s).	false
0	Coronavirus-Related Anxiety, Social Isolation, and Loneliness in Older Adults in Northern California during the Stay-at-Home Order. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of and associations between anxiety, social isolation, and loneliness in a sample of older adults in Northern California during the stay-at-home order enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. 514 older adults completed a 24-item survey. Perceived isolation and loneliness were reported in 56.4% and 36.0% of participants, respectively. Loneliness was found to be associated with both social isolation and COVID-19-related anxiety; however, social isolation and coronavirus-related anxiety were unrelated. Healthcare providers, social service providers, and families are encouraged to maintain or increase contact with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission during pregnancy. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation remains unclear. Here, we analyse the viral genome on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk from 31 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we also test specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses in placentas, and in maternal and umbilical cord plasma. We detect SARS-CoV-2 genome in one umbilical cord blood and in two at-term placentas, in one vaginal mucosa and in one milk specimen. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in one umbilical cord blood and in one milk specimen. Finally, in the three documented cases of vertical transmission, SARS-CoV-2 infection was accompanied by a strong inflammatory response. Together, these data support the hypothesis that in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission, while low, is possible. These results might help defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.	false
0	Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales outbreak: another dark side of COVID-19. In the hospital department dedicated to COVID-19-patient, infection prevention and control measures were upgraded. Therefore, the cross-transmission of other micro-organisms was thought unlikely to occur. However, we report an outbreak of NDM-5-producing E. coli in a 12-beds ICU dedicated to COVID-19 patients. This outbreak involved 6 patients of which 5 were asymptomatic carriers and 1 was infected. Several findings might have contributed to cross-transmission including the multiple-bedroom configuration of the department, uncomplete compliance for standard and contact precautions, overwork due to the burden of the disease, lack of training of staff for the care of ICU-patients, and misuse of gloves. Furthermore, as infection prevention and control measures were thought to be the applied, contact patients were not screened for eXDR carriage. Applying rigorously standard and contact precautions and performing screening in contact patients when indicated must be the rules in COVID-19 wards. Copyright © 2020.

0	"Characteristics and outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French intensive care units according to antiviral strategies: the COVADIS multicentre observational study. Background: Limited data are available regarding antiviral therapy efficacy in most severe patients under mechanical ventilation for Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Method(s): Comparison of antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (OHQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir) in an observational multicentre cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe Covid-19 ARDS. The primary endpoint was the number of day 28 ventilator-free days (VFD). Patients who died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized into ""patients still ventilated or dead at day 28"" versus ""patients weaned and alive at day 28"". Result(s): We analyzed 415 patients (85 treated with standard of care (SOC), 57 with L/R, 220 with OHQ, and 53 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and differed between groups (P = 0.03), SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. After adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and plateau pressure and accounting for center effect with a generalized linear mixed model, none of the antiviral strategies increased the chance of being alive and weaned from MV at day 28 compared to the SOC strategy (OR 0.48 CI95% (0.18-1.25); OR 0.96 (0.47-2.02) and OR 1.43 (0.53-4.04) for L/R, OHQ and other treatments, respectively). Acute kidney injury during ICU stay was frequent (55%); its incidence was higher in patients receiving lopinavir (66 vs 53%, P = 0.03). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, chronic hypertension and chronic renal disease, the use of L/R was associated with an increased risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT). (OR 2.52 CI95% 1.16-5.59). Conclusion(s): In this multicentre observational study of moderate-to-severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observe any benefit among patients treated with OHQ or L/R compared with SOC. The use of L/R treatment was associated with an increased need for RRT. Take home message Neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir/ritonavir as COVID-19 antiviral treatment is associated with higher ventilator-free days at day 28 when compared with standard of care (no antiviral treatment) in ICU patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. Lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with an increased risk of renal replacement therapy requirement. Tweet COVID-19: Insights from ARDS cohort: no signal of efficacy of any antiviral drugs.

0	A case of tocilizumab-induced leukoencephalopathy with a reversible clinical course. Tocilizumab (TCZ; Actemra/RoActemra) is an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases and cytokine storms. The present case is a 63-year-old female well-controlled RA patient, who presented with a progressive cognitive impairment after 34 months of TCZ administration. Brain MRI showed leukencephalopathy with a lactic acid peak in MRS, a decreased blood flow in SPECT, and a decreased accumulation in FDG-PET. The discontinuation of TCZ improved her cognitive function and brain MRI findings at 3 months after drug cessation. The present case suggests that TCZ may sometimes cause leukoencephalopathy after long-term administration, and thus the early discontinuation of TCZ is recommended to achieve a good prognosis.	false
0	Outcomes and Mortality Associated with Atrial Arrhythmias Among Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: The impact of atrial arrhythmias on COVID-19-associated outcomes are unclear. We sought to identify prevalence, risk factors and outcomes associated with atrial arrhythmias among patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: An observational cohort study of 1053 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection admitted to a quaternary care hospital and a community hospital was conducted. Data from electrocardiographic and telemetry were collected to identify atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter/tachycardia (AFL). The association between atrial arrhythmias and 30-day mortality was assessed with multivariable analysis., RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 62 +/- 17 years and 62% were men. Atrial arrhythmias were identified in 166 (15.8%) patients, with AF in 154 (14.6%) patients and AFL in 40 (3.8%) patients. Newly detected atrial arrhythmias occurred in 101 (9.6%) patients. Age, male sex, prior AF, renal disease, and hypoxia on presentation were independently associated with AF/AFL occurrence. Compared to patients without AF/AFL, patients with AF/AFL had significantly higher levels of troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer. Mortality was significantly higher among patients with AF/AFL (39.2%) compared to patients without (13.4%; P<0.001). After adjustment for age and co-morbidities, AF/AFL (adjusted OR 1.93; P = 0.007) and newly detected AF/AFL (adjusted OR 2.87; P <0.001) were independently associated with 30-day mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Atrial arrhythmias are common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The presence of AF/AFL tracked with markers of inflammation and cardiac injury. Atrial arrhythmias were independently associated with increased mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Advances and Recent Developments in Asthma in 2020. In this review, we discuss recent publications on asthma and review the studies that have reported on the different aspects of the prevalence, risk factors and prevention, mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment of asthma. Many risk and protective factors and molecular mechanisms are involved in the development of asthma. Emerging concepts and challenges in implementing the exposome paradigm and its application in allergic diseases and asthma are reviewed, including genetic and epigenetic factors, microbial dysbiosis and environmental exposure, particularly to indoor and outdoor substances. The most relevant experimental studies further advancing the understanding of molecular and immune mechanisms with potential new targets for the development of therapeutics are discussed. A reliable diagnosis of asthma, disease endotyping and monitoring its severity are of great importance in the management of asthma. Correct evaluation and management of asthma comorbidity/multimorbidity, includinginteraction with asthma phenotypes and its value for the precision medicine approach and validation of predictive biomarkers are further detailed. Novel approaches and strategies in asthma treatment linked to mechanisms and endotypes of asthma, particularly biologicals, are critically appraised. Finally, due to the recent pandemics andits impact on patient management, we discuss the challenges, relationships, and molecular mechanisms between asthma, allergies, SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19.

0	Tissue Proteases and Immune Responses: Influencing Factors of COVID-19 Severity and Mortality. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected the global population despite socioeconomic status and amazed surveillance agencies for its incidence, mortality, and recovery rates. COVID-19 affects all age groups; however, it is suggested to progress into severe disease and cause mortality in over 10% of the confirmed cases, depending on the individual characteristics of the affected population. One of the biggest unanswered questions it is why only some individuals develop into the severe stages of the disease. Current data indicate that most of the critically ill are the elderly or those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. However, it has been noted that, in some populations, severe disease is mostly observed in much younger individuals (<60-years old) with no reported underlying medical conditions. Certainly, many factors may contribute to disease severity including intrinsic host factors such as genetic variants, the expression levels of tissue proteins, among others. Considering all these aspects, this review aims to discuss how the expression levels of tissue proteases and the different profiles of immune responses influence the susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as disease severity and outcome.	false
0	Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell cultures by peptide-conjugated morpholino-oligomers. Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and a pathogen of immense global public health importance. Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking., Objectives and Methods: Five PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5'-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID 50 infectivity assays., Results: PPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5'-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner., Conclusion: The data indicate that PPMO have the ability to potently and specifically suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth and are promising candidates for further pre-clinical development.	false
0	A short perspective on a COVID-19 clinical study: 'diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR using exhale breath condensate samples'. Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19) is currently based on detection of the viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, sampling via nasopharyngeal swabs frequently provokes sneezing or coughing, which results in increased risk of the viral dissemination and environmental contamination. Furthermore, the sensitivity associated with the PCR tests s limited to 60%-70%, which is mainly attributable to technical deficiency in sampling. Given that the disease is transmitted via exhaled aerosol and droplets, and that the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is the established modality for sampling exhaled aerosol, detection of the viral RNA in EBC is a promising approach for safe and efficient diagnosis of the disease. Subjects are those patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test and admitted to Saitama Medical Center, Japan. EBC samples will be collected using an R-tube R or R-tubeVent R device. Collected EBC samples will be introduced into a nucleic acid purifier. The purified nucleic acids will undergo amplification through RT-PCR for detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 RNA. To date we have collected eight samples from seven subjects. Among them, two samples from two subjects tested positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA by the RT-PCR. Reflecting the second wave of COVID-19 prevalence in Japan, new admissions of COVID-19 patients to the Saitama Medical Center are increasing, and we are expecting to collect at least 50 EBC samples from 25 patients before the end of this year.	false
0	[The peak of the Coronavirus emergency and hemodialysis patients: the experience of the Dialysis Center in Crema]. Lombardy was violently hit by Covid-19 between the end of February and the beginning of March 2020. On 09.05.2020 there were 81225 total registered Covid-19+ cases (8051 / million inhabitants) with 14924 deaths (1479 deaths / million inhabitants). The province of Cremona presented a higher number of Covid-19+ cases and a worse relative mortality than the already high regional average. Patients on regular hemodialysis treatment present a high risk of infection due to the co-pathologies present, while healthcare workers may represent a risk for themselves and for the patients, due to the treatment environment and the close contact with them. All patients and healthcare workers of the Dialysis Center in Crema were evaluated (oro-pharyngeal swab for viral RNA research, qualitative anti-Covid-19 antibodies, quantitative IgG antibodies, co-pathologies), regardless of the symptomatology, over a 60-day period. Hemodialysis patients have a risk of infection that is 12.7 times that of the local population, while healthcare workers outperform the patients for Covid-positivity (30.3% vs 21.6%). Lethality in infected patients is high (31% of Covid-19+ subjects), while it is zero among healthcare professionals. The antibody response (qualitative and quantitative) in Covid-19+ patients is adequate, when compared to that of Covid-19+ healthcare staff. In our Center, the most critical phase lasted about 45 days but, thanks to the measures taken, it was possible to make the dialysis area Covid-free, as it remains after 128 days.	false
0	An evaluation of mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Mathematical modelling performs a vital part in estimating and controlling the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Antibodies at work in the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In view of devastating effects of COVID-19 on human life, there is an urgent need for the licened vaccines or therapeutics for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy	false

Oncologic patients are regarded as the population most at risk of developing a severe course of COVID-19 due to the fact that malignant diseases and chemotherapy often weaken the immune system. In the face of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, how particular patients deal with this infection remains an important question. In the period between the 15 and 26 April 2020, a total of 1227 patients were tested in one of seven oncologic outpatient clinics for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, employing RT-qPCR. Of 1227 patients, 78 (6.4%) were tested positive of SARS-CoV-2. Only one of the patients who tested positive developed a severe form of COVID-19 with pneumonia (CURB-65 score of 2), and two patients showed mild symptoms. Fourteen of 75 asymptomatic but positively tested patients received chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy according to their regular therapy algorithm (+/-4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 test), and 48 of 78 (61.5%) positive-tested patients received glucocorticoids as co-medication. None of the asymptomatic infected patients showed unexpected complications due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection during the cancer treatment. These data clearly contrast the view that patients with an oncologic disease are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that compromising therapies could be continued or started despite the ongoing pandemic. Moreover the relatively low appearance of symptoms due to COVID-19 among patients on chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive co-medication like glucocorticoids indicate that suppressing the response capacity of the immune system reduces disease severity.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	HLA and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2-induced Guillain-Barre syndrome. We report the clinical and immunological features in a case of SARS-CoV-2-induced Guillain-Barre syndrome (Si-GBS), suggesting that (1) Si-GBS can develop even after paucisymptomatic COVID-19 infection; (2) a distinctive cytokine repertoire is associated with this autoimmune complication, with increased CSF concentration of IL-8, and moderately increased serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha; (3) a particular genetic predisposition can be relevant, since the patient carried several HLA alleles known to be associated with GBS, including distinctive class I (HLA-A33) and class II alleles (DRB1*03:01 and DQB1*05:01). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of GBS in which SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the CSF, further strengthening the role of the virus as a trigger. In conclusion, our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies need to be searched in the serum and CSF in patients with GBS living in endemic areas, even in the absence of a clinically severe COVID-19 infection, and that IL-8 pathway can be relevant in Si-GBS pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to conclude on the relevance of the genetic findings, but it is likely that HLA plays a role in this setting as in other autoimmune neurological syndromes, including those triggered by infections.Copyright © 2020, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.	false
0	Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs. Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a real-time PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of the real-time PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.	false
0	Transfusion requirements in patients with COVID-19. Since the emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, our knowledge of the clinical implications of infection with SARS-CoV-2 has steadily grown. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure. COVID-19 induces a proinflammatory state, activating systemic coagulation and resulting in markedly elevated D-Dimers, fibrinogen and a prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) (Tang et al, 2020). Initial studies reported the development of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), associated with poorer outcomes (Tang et al, 2020). DIC results from perturbations in the normal haemostatic balance and may produce a clinical phenotype of thrombosis, bleeding or a combination thereof. Subsequently, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) issued guidance on the management of DIC in this setting (Thachil et al, 2020). This guidance was controversial, recommending admission based on coagulation parameters and more liberal transfusion thresholds (maintaining platelets >25 in non-bleeding patients). At this time, COVID-19 represented a particular challenge to transfusion services as concerns existed that transfusion requirements may be increased at a time of limited donor availability. Despite increasing data on thrombotic sequalae of COVID-19, there remains a paucity of information on transfusion requirements in this clinical setting. This is of importance, not only for physicians, but for clinical transfusion services in order to plan stock management during the pandemic. To address this deficit, we retrospectively analysed the transfusion records and outcomes of a large cohort of patients with COVID-19.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Many scientific reports document that asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of COVID-19, probably during conversations in social interactions. Droplet emission occurs during speech, yet few studies document the flow to provide the transport mechanism. This lack of understanding prevents informed public health guidance for risk reduction and mitigation strategies, e.g., the ""6-foot rule."" Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including phonetic features, using orders-of-magnitude estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We document the spatiotemporal structure of the expelled airflow. Phonetic characteristics of plosive sounds like ""P"" lead to enhanced directed transport, including jet-like flows that entrain the surrounding air. We highlight three distinct temporal scaling laws for the transport distance of exhaled material including 1) transport over a short distance (<0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with large angular variations due to the complexity of speech; 2) a longer distance, ~1 m, where directed transport is driven by individual vortical puffs corresponding to plosive sounds; and 3) a distance out to about 2 m, or even farther, where sequential plosives in a sentence, corresponding effectively to a train of puffs, create conical, jet-like flows. The latter dictates the long-time transport in a conversation. We believe that this work will inform thinking about the role of ventilation, aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerophonetics."	false

More than six million people have been infected, and more than 360,000 of them have died. This is the worst catastrophe suffered by mankind in recent history. In the face of this severe disaster, people all over the world are frightened of the prospect of facing an outbreak or an annual recurrence. However, the development of a vaccine will help control the impact of COVID-19. Women in particular have been more seriously affected by the pandemic. Since the pressure and physical load they suffer are often greater than what men endure, women are more threatened by COVID-19. Though women have a poorer quality of life and work and face worse economic conditions, they also tend to have better physiological immunity than men, which can ease the effect of COVID-19. The early development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is an important issue that must take into consideration women's better immune response to the virus along with the technique of hormone regulation. Relevant research has been conducted on female-specific vaccines in the past, and women's issues were considered during those clinical trials to ensure that complications and antibody responses were positive and effective in women. National policies should also propose good strategies for women to be vaccinated. This could improve consciousness, give women a better vaccination experience, enhance their willingness to vaccinate, and protect them from COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Traditional Chinese medicine in antiviral treatment. The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019, attracted worldwide attention. With a long incubation period and strong infectiousness, COVID-19 poses a great threat to the life and health worldwide with high incidence, high pathogenicity and low sensitivity to antibiotics. At present, there are less kinds of antiviral drugs, including rimantadine hydiochloride, acyclovir, interferon, zidovudine, ribavirin, etc., which maybe lead to severe adverse reactions of the nervous system, hematopoietic system, liver and kidney system, as well as side effects such as nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Meanwhile, the development of antiviral drugs requires huge investment and time, the development of effective antiviral drugs and vaccine lags far behind the rapidly developed disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role against the infection, especially in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza, H7N9 flu virus, middle east respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus infection. In this paper, the classification, mechanism, existing problems and the prospect of traditional Chinese medicine in antiviral treatment has been summarized in order to provide certain reference for the research and prescription screening of traditional Chinese medicine anti-COVID-19 drugs.Copyright © 2020, Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co.

0	Prolonged prothrombin time at admission predicts poor clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND The prognostic value of coagulation disorder in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients should be demonstrated. AIM To investigate the abnormalities of coagulation parameters in the patients with COVID-19 and their prognostic values. METHODS Consecutive patients admitted in the isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 31 to February 5, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival as of March 11. Demographics, vital signs, comorbidities and laboratory tests were collected and compared between those who died and survivors. Logistic regression analysis for prognostic factors was performed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the estimated survival rate between patients with prolonged prothrombin time and normal prothrombin time. RESULTS The total number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were enrolled was 213. The median age was 62 years, and 95 patients (44.6%) were men. Fifty-one patients were critical (23.9%), 79 patients were severe (37.1%) and 83 patients were moderate (39%). As of March 11, 2020, 99 patients were discharged (46.5%), 79 patients (37.1%) stayed in the hospital and 35 patients (16.2%) died. Median time to death was 6 (4-8) d, while median hospital stay was 32 (22-36) d in survivors (P < 0.001). More men (P = 0.002) and elderly patients (P < 0.001) were found in the group of those who died. The respiration rate at admission was higher in the group of those who died (P < 0.001). The incidences of hypertension (P = 0.028), cerebrovascular disease (P < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (P = 0.02) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < 0.001) were higher in the group of those who died. Platelet count was decreased in the group of those who died (P = 0.002) whereas prothrombin time (P < 0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.033), concentration of D-dimer (P < 0.001) and fibrin degradation products (P < 0.001) were increased in the group of those who died. Prothrombin time [odds ratio (OR): 2.19, P = 0.004], respiration rate (OR: 1.223, P < 0.001), age (OR: 1.074, P < 0.001) and fibrin degradation products concentration (OR: 1.02, P = 0.014) were predictors of death. The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with prolonged prothrombin time compare to those with normal prothrombin time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Prothrombin time, concentration of fibrin degradation products, respiration rate and age were predictive factors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Work-related and personal factors associated with mental well-being during the COVID-19 response: Survey of health care and other workers. Background: The response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective(s): The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. Method(s): All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. Result(s): There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age <40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

0	Pulmonary Thrombosis or Embolism in a Large Cohort of Hospitalized Patients With Covid-19. Objective: We set out to analyze the incidence and predictive factors of pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Method(s): We prospectively collected data from all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 admitted to the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, a university hospital in Barcelona, between March 9 and April 15, 2020. Patients with suspected PE, according to standardized guidelines, underwent CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Result(s): A total of 1,275 patients with Covid-19 were admitted to hospital. CTPA was performed on 76 inpatients, and a diagnosis of PE was made in 32 (2.6% [95%CI 1.7-3.5%]). Patients with PE were older, and they exhibited lower PaO2:FiO2 ratios and higher levels of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP). They more often required admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation, and they often had longer hospital stays, although in-hospital mortality was no greater than in patients without PE. High CRP and D-dimer levels at admission (>=150 mg/L and >=1,000 ng/ml, respectively) and a peak D-dimer >=6,000 ng/ml during hospital stay were independent factors associated with PE. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin did not appear to prevent PE. Increased CRP levels correlated with increased D-dimer levels and both correlated with a lower PaO2:FiO2. Conclusion(s): The 2.6% incidence of PE in Covid-19 hospitalized patients is clearly high. Higher doses of thromboprophylaxis may be required to prevent PE, particularly in patients at increased risk, such as those with high levels of CRP and D-dimer at admission. These findings should be validated in future studies.© Copyright © 2020 Benito, Filella, Mateo, Fortuna, Gutierrez-Alliende, Hernandez, Gimenez, Pomar, Castellvi, Corominas, Casademont and Domingo.	false
0	LATE BREAKING NEWS E-POSTER PRESENTATION: LBP 2 COVID-19 Myopathy: Persistence of Viral Particles in the Skeletal Muscle. A 36-year-old man presented with 3-day fever and no other associated symptoms. He was tested positive for COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR assay from a nasopharyngeal swab/SARS Coronavirus 2 ORF1ab/2019 Novel Coronavirus E Gene.) On day 3, he became asymptomatic. On day 11, he developed myalgias and progressively worsening weakness. On day 25, he was non-ambulatory and serum creatine kinase (CK) level exceeded 11000 IU/L (normal 35-190 IU/L). Neurological examination demonstrated dense bilateral proximal muscle weakness. Electro-diagnostic testing revealed markedly myopathic features. Treatment with IV fluids and Lasix did not render clinical improvement and CK remained persistently elevated above 7800 U/L. Only after infusion of IV IG 2g/kg, the patient's condition started to improve and CK trended down. On day 31, repeat COVID-19 testing was negative. A biopsy from the right vastus lateralis muscle was done. Pathological examination revealed features of necrotizing myopathy (figure) with inflammatory cell infiltrates predominantly CD68+ macrophages with rare CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells and no CD20+ B-cells. Electron microscopy (EM) identified viral particles (size: 50-200 nanometers in diameter; morphologically consistent with COVID-19) in the subsarcolemmal regions and endothelial cells of the endomyisal/perimysial capillaries. Our case is the first description of COVID-19 myopathy and EM demonstration of viral particles in the muscle to our knowledge. COVID-19 viral particles persisted in the muscle fibers and vascular endothelial cells 5 weeks after the initial infection and repeat testing for COVID-19 was negative. COVID-19 myopathy, demonstrating features of immune-mediated necrotizing process, is a novel entity and future studies are required.Copyright © 2020	false
0	World one-hundred days after COVID-19 outbreak: Incidence, case fatality rate, and trend. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of viral diseases is on the rise and has caused many problems for public health. COVID-19 is a new viral outbreak in the world. This study aimed to investigate the trends of incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in the world by April 30, 2020. METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical study. We investigated the number of cases and deaths in 35 selected countries and regions of the WHO that had at least 10,000 cases by the time of the study. In addition, the incidence and CFR of COVID-19 were investigated. Finally, time trends of the number of cases, deaths, and CFR were investigated using ordinary least squares regression models. RESULTS: The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 3,090,184. The European region had the highest number of COVID-19 patients (1,434,649 [46.43%]). Ukraine with 10,406 and the USA with 1,003,974 cases have reported the lowest and highest confirmed cases, respectively. In addition, the European region and the African region with 157.13 and 2.50 patients per 100,000 population had the highest and the lowest incidence rate, respectively. India (2.44) and Spain (455.69) had the lowest and the highest incidence rate per 100,000 population, respectively. In the world, 217,759 deaths have happened, of which 135,961 (62.44%) were reported in the European region. Furthermore, the USA had the highest number of deaths (52,428) due to COVID-19. CFR was 7.05% in the world, which ranged from 3.74% in the African region and 9.48% in the European region. The number of patients and deaths due to COVID-19 had increasing trends in all countries, and the trend of CFR just for Iran and Ukraine was negative. CONCLUSION: The countries had different trends in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. However, regarding the increasing trend of the disease in the world, it will be more important to rely on public prevention strategies. It is necessary to apply and continue public health policies at national and global levels till the control of the disease.	false
0	Ferritin as a Marker of Severity in COVID-19 Patients: A Fatal Correlation. Background: Ferritin, the cellular protein storage for iron, has emerged as a key molecule in the immune system, orchestrating the cellular defense against inflammation. At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic. Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel. Results: A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817.6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708.6 ng/ml) P = 0.02. Conclusions: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response. In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia.	false
0	Hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in healthcare workers: a randomized trial. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging virus causing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic with no known effective prophylaxis. We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high-risk of exposure., METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with Covid-19, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations., RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18) and for twice weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19 (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08)., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or Covid-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.	false
0	Characteristics Associated with Adults Remembering to Wash Hands in Multiple Situations Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, October 2019 and June 2020. Washing hands often, especially during times when one is likely to acquire and spread pathogens,* is one important measure to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as other pathogens spread by respiratory or fecal-oral transmission (1,2). Studies have reported moderate to high levels of self-reported handwashing among adults worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic (3-5) ; however, little is known about how handwashing behavior among U.S. adults has changed since the start of the pandemic. For this study, survey data from October 2019 (prepandemic) and June 2020 (during pandemic) were compared to assess changes in adults' remembering to wash their hands in six situations. Statistically significant increases in reported handwashing were seen in June 2020 compared with October 2019 in four of the six situations; the odds of remembering to wash hands was 2.3 times higher among respondents after coughing, sneezing, or blowing their nose, 2.0 times higher before eating at a restaurant, and 1.7 times higher before eating at home. Men, young adults aged 18-24 years, and non-Hispanic White (White) adults were less likely to remember to wash hands in multiple situations. Strategies to help persons remember to wash their hands frequently and at important times should be identified and implemented, especially among groups reporting low prevalence of remembering to wash their hands.	false
0	COVID-19 and the rise of intimate partner violence. Stay-at-home policies have been implemented worldwide to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is a growing concern that such policies could increase violence against women. We find evidence in support of this critical concern. We focus on Peru, a country that imposed a strict nationwide lockdown starting in mid-March and where nearly 60% of women already experienced violence before COVID-19. Using administrative data on phone calls to the helpline for domestic violence (Linea 100), we find that the incidence rate of the calls increased by 48 percent between April and July 2020, with effects increasing over time. The rise in calls is found across all states and it is not driven by baseline characteristics, including previous prevalence of violence against women. These findings create the need to identify policies to mitigate the negative impact of stay-at-home orders on women's safety. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Trends in COVID-19 Incidence After Implementation of Mitigation Measures - Arizona, January 22-August 7, 2020. Mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requires individual, community, and state public health actions to prevent person-to-person transmission. Community mitigation measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19; these measures include wearing masks, social distancing, reducing the number and size of large gatherings, pausing operation of businesses where maintaining social distancing is challenging, working from or staying at home, and implementing certain workplace and educational institution controls (1-4). The Arizona Department of Health Services' (ADHS) recommendations for mitigating exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were informed by continual monitoring of patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 community spread, and the pandemic's impacts on hospitals. To assess the effect of mitigation strategies in Arizona, the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases and 7-day moving averages during January 22-August 7, 2020, relative to implementation of enhanced community mitigation measures, were examined. The average number of daily cases increased approximately 151%, from 808 on June 1, 2020 to 2,026 on June 15, 2020 (after stay-at-home order lifted), necessitating increased preventive measures. On June 17, local officials began implementing and enforcing mask wearing (via county and city mandates),* affecting approximately 85% of the state population. Statewide mitigation measures included limitation of public events; closures of bars, gyms, movie theaters, and water parks; reduced restaurant dine-in capacity; and voluntary resident action to stay at home and wear masks (when and where not mandated). The number of COVID-19 cases in Arizona peaked during June 29-July 2, stabilized during July 3-July 12, and further declined by approximately 75% during July 13-August 7. Widespread implementation and enforcement of sustained community mitigation measures informed by state and local officials' continual data monitoring and collaboration can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the numbers of COVID-19 cases.	false
0	Fondaparinux Use in Patients With COVID-19: A Preliminary Multicenter Real-World Experience. The use of heparin has been shown to decrease the mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical impact of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with fondaparinux versus enoxaparin among 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, major bleeding (MB), clinically relevant non-MB, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in-hospital mortality was compared between patients on fondaparinux versus enoxaparin therapy. The 2 groups were homogeneous for demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics. In a median follow-up of 28 (IQR: 12-45) days, no statistically significant difference in venous thromboembolism (14.5% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.20), MB and clinically relevant non-MB (3.2% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.76), ARDS (17.7% vs. 15.8%; P = 0.83), and in-hospital mortality (9.7% vs. 10.5%; P = 0.97) has been shown between the enoxaparin group versus the fondaparinux group. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis of a safe and effective use of fondaparinux among patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in internal medicine units.	false
0	Early Identification of IgA Anti-SARSCoV-2 in Milk of Mother With COVID-19 Infection. INTRODUCTION: Human milk cannot currently be considered a major source of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, it can contain specific antibodies that could modulate a possible newborn infection by SARS-CoV-2. MAIN ISSUE: A 32-year-old pregnant woman, gestational age 37 and 3/7 weeks, was admitted with a flu-like syndrome caused by COVID-19. The female newborn was appropriate for gestational age, with a birth weight of 2,890 g, length 48 cm, and head circumference 34 cm. MANAGEMENT: The mother-infant dyad remained in the rooming-in unit during hospitalization, exclusively breastfeeding and following World Health Organization recommendations for contact and airway precautions. On the 3rd day after delivery, two mother's milk samples (3 and 5 mL) were collected by hand expression. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min twice consecutively to separate fat, which was removed, and the remaining material was transferred to another tube to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G (ELISA, Kit EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A was detected in the two samples evaluated, whose values were 2.5 and 1.9, respectively. No anti-SARSCoV-2 immunoglobulin G was detected. The exclusively-breastfed infant remained well through 45 days of age. CONCLUSION(S): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A in the milk of mothers infected with COVID-19 may be related to protection against the transmission and severity of the disease in their infants.	false
0	Can elevated concentrations of ALT and AST predict the risk of 'recurrence' of COVID-19?. 'Recurrence'of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has triggered numerous discussions of scholars at home and abroad. A total of44 recurrent cases of COVID-19 and 32 control cases admitted from 11 February to 29 March 2020 to Guanggu Campus of Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology were enrolled in thisstudy.Allthe 44 recurrent caseswere classified asmild to moderate when the patients were admitted for the second time.The gender and mean age in both cases (recurrent and control) were similar. At least one concomitant disease was observed in 52.27% recurrent cases and 34.38% control cases. The most prevalent comorbidity among them was hypertension. Fever and cough being the most prevalent clinical symptoms in both cases. On comparing both the cases, recurrent cases had markedly elevated concentrations of alanine aminotransferase(ALT)(P = 0.020) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST)(P = 0.007).Moreover, subgroup analysis showed mild to moderate abnormal concentrations of ALT and ASTin recurrent cases.The elevated concentrations of ALT and AST may be recognized as predictive markers for the risk of 'recurrence'of COVID-19, whichmayprovide insights into the prevention and control of COVID-19in the future.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

0	Influenza-like illness and SARS-Cov-2 in the multicenter, prospective, observational INVIDIa-2 study (INfluenza Vaccine Indication During therapy with Immune checkpoint inhibitors: A transversal challenge): A FICOG study. Background: The susceptibility of advanced cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for viral infections has not been investigated. Currently, there are no robust data supporting the efficacy, safety and recommendation for influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICI. Method(s): The prospective, multicenter, observational INVIDIa-2 study investigated the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors receiving ICI between October 2019 and January 2020. The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI, primary endpoint) was observed until April 30, 2020. Secondary endpoints included a non-prespecified analysis for COVID-19. Result(s): The study enrolled 1279 patients; 1188 were evaluable. Of them, 11 patients developed ILI symptoms with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (incidence of 0.9% and lethality of 72%, irrespective of the flu vaccination). Of the remaining 1177 patients, 574 received flu vaccination (48.8%). The ILI incidence was 7.7% (91 patients of 1177). Patients receiving the flu vaccine were significantly more frequently elderly (p<0.0001), former or active smokers (p<0.0001), affected by lung cancer (p=0.017) and by non-cancer comorbidities (p<0.0001) when compared to unvaccinated patients. The flu vaccine did not prevent ILI in the study population, irrespective of the vaccine type (quadrivalent vs trivalent, adjuvated vs non): the incidence of ILI was 8.2% in vaccinated vs 7.3% in unvaccinated patients (p=0.57). ILI complications were significantly less frequent for patients receiving flu vaccine (12.8% vs 40.9%, p=0.002). Hospital admission due to ILI occurred for 10 patients (11% of ILI cases; 7 were unvaccinated). The ILI lethality was 2.2% (2 of 91 patients, both unvaccinated). Among vaccinated patients, those receiving adjuvated vaccines had lower incidence of ILI (4.8% vs 9.9%, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Flu vaccination was not effective for ILI prevention, nor for COVID-19. Nevertheless, it reduced ILI complications, with no ILI-related deaths in vaccinated patients. We recommend the vaccine in ICI-treated cancer patients. Clinical trial identification: Eudract number of the trial: 2020-002603-18.

0	Association of mortality and recent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in COVID-19 patients. To compare characteristics and outcomes of patients who had COVID-19 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to those without M. pneumoniae antibodies. We retrospectively reviewed cases admitted over a 4-week period between 17 March 2020 and 14 April 2020 to the Hoboken University Medical Center, NJ, USA. We compared the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who were positive for M. pneumoniae IgM with those who were negative for M. pneumoniae IgM. The primary outcome was mortality. The adjusted odds ratio was calculated after controlling for baseline differences. Of 139 patients admitted with COVID-19, 79 were positive for M. pneumoniae IgM. The mortality among those who were M. pneumoniae IgM positive was significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio: 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 5.03) compared with those who were M. pneumoniae IgM negative. Patients with coinfection (COVID-19 and mycoplasma) have higher mortality compared with patients with just COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: Observations from an Indian inception cohort. Introduction: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has led to severe disruption of healthcare services worldwide. We conducted this study to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients who were enrolled in the nation-wide inception cohort. Method(s): A questionnaire was administered to the SLE patients enrolled in the inception cohort. Questions related to the effect on disease activity, preventive measures adopted against COVID-19, the incidence of COVID-19, hardships faced in getting access to health care professionals and availability of medicines, adherence, fear of COVID-19 and the potential benefits of being part of the registry. Result(s): A total of 1040 (90% females) patients completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 27.5 +/- 19.1 years and the mean disease duration was 1.25 years. Twenty-Four (2.3%) patients had developed fever (>1 day) during this period, including one patient with additional symptoms of diarrhoea and anosmia, however, none of the patients developed COVID-19 infection. 262 patients (25.2%) reported financial difficulty during this period and patients reported an average excess expenditure of at least 2255.45 INR ($30) per month. 378 patients (36%) reported problems in getting their prescribed medicines due to lockdown. Of these, 167 (40%) patients needed to change their medication schedule due to this non-availability. Almost 54% of patients missed their scheduled follow up visits during the lockdown period and 37% of patients were unable to get their investigations done due to closure of laboratories and hospitals. 266 patients (25.5%) reported worsening of various symptoms of SLE during this period. Almost 61% patients felt confident that being associated with the inception cohort had helped them in managing their disease better during this period of lockdown as they received help in the form of timely and frequent telephonic consults, assistance in making the medicines available, and regular counselling resulting in abetment of their fears and anxieties. Conclusion(s): The current COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on our SLE patients. Patients faced difficulty in the availability of medicines, missed the doses of medicines, had financial constraints, and spent more money on health during the pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Parkinsonism as a Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic?. Since the initial reports of COVID-19 in December 2019, the world has been gripped by the disastrous acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are an ever-increasing number of reports of neurological symptoms in patients, from severe (encephalitis), to mild (hyposmia), suggesting the potential for neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.	false
0	MASSIVE STROKE IN A CRITICALLY ILL COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENT DESPITE DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY AND VTE PROPHYLAXIS. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection leads to increased incidence of thrombotic events in critically ill patients [1]. Studies regarding the benefits of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients have yielded mixed results[2,3]. The literature is unclear as to an effective strategy for VTE prevention in COVID-19 patients. In this case we will present a COVID-19 positive critically ill patient who suffered a large ischemic cerebrovascular accident despite receiving daily VTE prophylaxis and dual anti-platelet therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine cancer receiving chemotherapy at the time of admission. Patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial head CT scan demonstrated no definite acute intracranial findings. Patient was intubated without complications and admitted to the ICU. She was continued on her home doses of Plavix 75mg daily and Aspirin 81mg daily and started on subcutaneous Enoxaparin 40mg once daily for VTE prophylaxis. On hospital day #15 patient's sedation was discontinued in preparation for spontaneous breathing trial, yet she did not return to baseline mental status. On hospital day #18 head CT scan was performed which revealed interval development of large late subacute/chronic left anterior and middle cerebral artery territory infarction (Image 1). At this time our patient is still receiving treatment for complications of COVID-19 pneumonia and has had no change in her mental status. DISCUSSION: In this case report our patient with COVID-19 pneumonia suffered an ischemic stroke despite dual anti-platelet therapy and VTE prophylaxis. Thrombotic complications are common in critically ill COVID-19 patients with an incidence reported to be as high as 31% [1]. One study found decreased mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation [2]. However, another found a significant incidence of thrombotic events despite anticoagulation [3]. The role of dual anti-platelet therapy in conjunction with standard VTE prophylaxis has not been studied. Currently no cases of a COVID-19 patient suffering a thrombotic event while on dual anti-platelet therapy and VTE prophylaxis have been reported. A limitation of this case is that our patient was actively being treated for cancer, a known pro-thrombotic state, which may have contributed to her thrombotic event. CONCLUSION(S): This case report demonstrates that despite dual anti-platelet therapy and VTE prophylaxis our COVID-19 patient suffered a thrombotic event. These findings suggest that COVID-19 VTE prevention requires enhanced anticoagulation strategies compared to usual VTE prevention regimens. Further studies examining the role of dual anti-platelet therapy as well as various doses of anticoagulation are needed to elucidate effective strategies for VTE prevention in COVID-19 patients.

0	"Estimation of infection density and epidemic size of COVID-19 using the back-calculation algorithm. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is continuing its spread across the world, claiming more than 160,000 lives and sickening more than 2,400,000 people as of April 21, 2020. Early research has reported a basic reproduction number (R0) between 2.2 to 3.6, implying that the majority of the population is at risk of infection if no intervention measures were undertaken. The true size of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unknown, as a significant proportion of infected individuals only exhibit mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. A timely assessment of the evolving epidemic size is crucial for resource allocation and triage decisions. In this article, we modify the back-calculation algorithm to obtain a lower bound estimate of the number of COVID-19 infected persons in China in and outside the Hubei province. We estimate the infection density among infected and show that the drastic control measures enforced throughout China following the lockdown of Wuhan City effectively slowed down the spread of the disease in two weeks. We also investigate the COVID-19 epidemic size in South Korea and find a similar effect of its ""test, trace, isolate, and treat"" strategy. Our findings are expected to provide guidelines and enlightenment for surveillance and control activities of COVID-19 in other countries around the world.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."	false
0	Incidental whole-body MRI evidence of COVID-19 in an asymptomatic patient in a high prevalence region. Background: The purpose of this case report is to emphasize the importance of curing any clinical radiological elements in this historical period, especially in the area of endemic to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) such as Lombardy and to stress the importance of the management of the asymptomatic patient, their crucial role in the spread of contagion. Case presentation: We reported the case of incidental diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia by first finding on whole-body MR (WB-MR) in the patient affected by multiple myeloma (MM), with a negative respiratory symptoms at the time and with previous (1 month before) negative chest X-ray. The patient was promptly subjected to chest CT, which confirmed the suspicion of interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia and, in hospitalization, performed nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RNA-PCR), with a doubtful outcome. Once the bacterial nature of the alterations was serologically and radiologically excluded, the patient was definitively diagnosed with COVID-19 and appropriately treated in hospitalization. Conclusion: The clinical choices must, therefore, to make use of all the diagnostic tools available and full knowledge of the limitation of each of them.	false
0	The assessment of the serum levels of TWEAK and prostaglandin F2? in COVID - 19. BACKGROUND/AIM: It is claimed that aberrant immune response has a more important role than the cytopathic effect of the virus in the morbidity and mortality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID - 19). We aimed to investigate the possible roles of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) / Fn14 pathway and leukotrienes (LT) in uncontrolled immune response that occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV - 2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 25 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID - 19 as well as 22 healthy volunteer. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum TWEAK, LTE4, and prostaglandin F2? (PGF2?) levels were determined. RESULT(S): Compared with the healthy control group, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher in the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection without lung involvement. In the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection with lung involvement, age, fibrinogen, sedimentation, C - reactive protein and ferritin, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher, and lymphocyte levels were lower compared with the asymptomatic group. CONCLUSION(S): In the study, TWEAK and LTE4 levels increased in cases with COVID -19. These results support that TWEAK / Fn14 pathway and LT may involved in the pathology of aberrant immune response against SARS - CoV - 2. Inhibition of each of these pathways may be a potential target in the treatment of COVID - 19.	false
0	The first case of documented Covid-19 reinfection in Israel. We describe the first documented case of Covid-19 reinfection in Israel, out of only a handful such case worldwide, in a 20 year old otherwise healthy young woman. In the first occasion she was mildly symptomatic, whereas the second episode was apparently asymptomatic, except for tachycardia of 90/min, compared to 60/min in the first episode. The fact that out of 25 million infected persons worldwide only a handful of re-infected cases have been identified suggests that this is a rare phenomenon. Alternatively, it will be critical to rule out that new mutations are not introduced, which are not covered by existing immunity.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	"COVID-19 INFECTION COMPLICATED BY GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME: A CASE REPORT. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a current pandemic. It commonly manifests with fever, dyspnea, and cough. Few COVID-19 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have been reported. The severe inflammatory response and the critically-ill nature of many COVID-19 patients is a challenge to distinguish GBS from critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. We present a COVID-19 patient complicated by GBS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman presented with fever, cough, myalgia, and dyspnea for 10 days. A swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. CT chest revealed bilateral ""ground-glass"" opacities. She was started on oxygen, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine. Three weeks later, she developed bilateral symmetrical LE numbness and weakness that progressed to UE. Respiratory status worsened with increasing O2 requirements. Neuro exam showed weakness (2/5) in LE and (3/5) in UE. Respiratory muscle testing demonstrated a NIF of -35 cm H2O and an FVC of 1.7 L. MRI spine showed contrast enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots (Fig 1). CSF analysis revealed cytoalbuminologic dissociation (CAD) with 197 mg/dL of proteins and 0 WBC. She was diagnosed with GBS and started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.4g/Kg/day for 5 days. After a week of therapy, the patient improved, recovered from COVID-19, and was discharged home. DISCUSSION: GBS is a disorder in which the immune system attacks gangliosides on the peripheral nervous system. It presents with ascending weakness and can cause total body paralysis and respiratory failure in severe cases. It is associated with a variety of viral and bacterial infections. 12 cases of GBS have been reported in COVID-19 infection. GBS developed within 10 days of COVID diagnosis and presented with ascending progressive, flaccid quadriparesis. All except 2 patients underwent CSF analysis and 91% showed CAD. IVIG was used for all the patients, and one was started on plasmapheresis. The involvement of the PNS supports the coronavirus neurotropic invasion pathway. It is still unclear if SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade neurons and cause neuropathy. We could not test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in our case, but the absence of WBC in the CSF indicated an immune response typically seen in GBS rather than direct neuronal invasion, in which pleocytosis is expected. MRI usually showed contrast enhancement of cauda-equina nerve roots due to radicular irritation. CSF showing CAD is usually observed in the second week after symptom onset. IVIG is preferred over plasmapheresis for treating GBS due to fewer side effects. However, thrombotic events occur in 1-16.9%. All of the reported COVID-19 cases with GBS, including our case, received IVIG, and none of them reported thrombotic events. CONCLUSION(S): Our case emphasizes that GBS should be considered as one of the differentials in patients with COVID-19 patients with ARDS, polyneuropathy, and difficulty weaning off ventilator.

0	IMPENDING CARDIAC TAMPONADE AS THE INITIAL MANIFESTATION OF BCR-ABL-POSITIVE CML. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Approximately 50% of CML patients are asymptomatic at presentation. Pericardial effusion in the chronic phase of CML is a rare occurrence and association with tamponade is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69 y/o female with a recent diagnosis of BCR/ABL+ chronic myeloid leukemia, T2DM, HTN, and CAD who presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath (SOB). The patient reports her shortness of breath started worsening in the last couple of days prior to admission. Denied any orthopnea or PND. Endorsed positional dizziness, palpitation, poor oral intake, and poor appetite, easy bruising and episodes of blurry vision. Physical examination: Heart rate 95, BP 89/55. Hypoxic on 4L nasal cannula. Lung exam revealed crackles with decreased breath sounds, muffled heart sounds, and no murmurs. Labs: Hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.6 %, platelets 379k m/mm3, WBCs 105.2k m/mm3 and Peripheral smear (Figure 1) showed Neutrophils 46%, Bands 10%, lymphocyte 10 %, Monocyte 4%, Metamyelocyte 21%, Myelocyte 9%, blasts 1%. CMP showed: Na 134 mmol/L, K 7.3 mmol/L, Bicarb 19 mmol/L, BUN 103 mg/dL, Cr 3.4 mg/dL, Glucose 208 mg/dL, AST 17 U/L, ALT12 U/L, Uric acid 15.2 mg/dL. ProBNP 1135 pg/mL,Trop <0.015 ng/mL, and procalcitonin 1.3 ng/mL. COVID-19 screen is negative. Blood culture shows no growth after five days. Immunoglobulins were within normal limits. RF and ANA screen is negative. P-ANCA and C-ANCA antibodies are negative. C3 and C4 were within normal limits. CXR (Figure 2) showed air space disease, left side pleural effusion, and waterbottle-shaped heart concerning for pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography shows a large pericardial effusion of 2 cm circumferentially surrounding the heart with focal strands (Figure 3). Bedside Pericardiocentesis performed and 900cc of frank bloody fluid removed, and a drain was left in place for subsequent removal of 400cc on day 2 and 250 cc on day 3. Pericardial fluids analysis: negative gram stain/culture, bloody appearance, 2,300,000 RBCs, 64,420 WBCs with PMNs 94%, Lymphocyte 2%, and Monocyte 2%. Pericardial cytology showed infiltration by CML. The patient hemodynamics improved after pericardiocentesis, and a total of 1550 cc of bloody pericardial fluid was removed. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors were not started due to prolonged QTc of 540ms. DISCUSSION: The proposed mechanisms of pericardial effusions in patients with CML include leukemic infiltration into the pericardium, extramedullary hemopoiesis, obstruction of pericardial capillaries, infiltration of interstitial tissue by leukemic cells causing increased capillary permeability, and non-malignant etiologies, including infection and hypoproteinemia. CONCLUSION(S): CML is a rare cause of the pericardial effusion. Urgent pericardiocentesis may be indicated in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Routine echo recommended before starting TKIs, to rule out pericardial effusion. Reference #1: 1. Lam KY, Dickens P, and Chan AC. Tumors of the heart.

0	Rescue venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after cardiac arrest in COVID-19 myopericarditis: A case report. Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with potentially life threatening cardiovascular complications, including fulminant myocarditis and cardiac tamponade. Optimal management strategies are still unclear, including the role of immunomodulatory therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the context of cardiogenic shock. We report a case of a middle-aged female with COVID-19 who developed respiratory distress and hemodynamic deterioration with elevated troponin levels on the seventh day of symptoms. Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion with diastolic restriction of the right ventricle. Cardiac arrest developed during pericardiocentesis, resulting in emergency thoracotomy and pericardial drainage. Venoarterial ECMO was subsequently initiated due to refractory cardiogenic shock. Tocilizumab, immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and convalescent plasma were added to supportive care, with progressive recovery of cardiac function and successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. This case highlights the potential role of ECMO, convalescent plasma and immunomodulatory therapies in the management of cardiogenic shock associated with COVID-19 myopericarditis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Clinical evaluation of four commercial immunoassays for the detection of antibodies against established SARS-CoV-2 infection. A comparison of the clinical performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was performed. Patient sera were collected at least 6 weeks following onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms. Negative control specimens were stored specimens from those without COVID-19, collected in April-May 2019. Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the magnitude of serological response and clinical characteristics. There were 80 patients from whom 86 sera specimens were collected; six patients had duplicate specimens. There were 95 negative control specimens from 95 patients. The clinical sensitivity of the Elecsys assay was 98.84% (95% CI 93.69-99.97), specificity was 100% (95% CI 96.19-100.00); the Liaison assay clinical sensitivity was 96.51% (95% CI 90.14-99.27), specificity was 97.89% (95% CI 92.60-99.74); the Access assay clinical sensitivity was 84.88% (95% CI 75.54-91.70), specificity was 98.95% (95% CI 94.27-99.97); and the Vitros assay clinical sensitivity was 97.67% (95% CI 91.85-99.72), specificity was 100% (95% CI 96.15-100.00). A requirement for hospitalisation for COVID-19 infection was associated with a larger Vitros, Liaison and Access IgG response whilst fever was associated with a larger Elecsys response. All assays evaluated with the exception of the Access assay demonstrated similar performance. The Elecsys assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia	false
0	Risk of COVID-19-related death among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma prescribed inhaled corticosteroids: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform. Background: Early descriptions of patients admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a lower prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than would be expected for an acute respiratory disease like COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) might protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the development of serious sequelae. We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. Method(s): In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting beta agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA-LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA-LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. Finding(s): We identified 148 557 people with COPD and 818 490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA-LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 1.39 [95% CI 1.10-1.76]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (1.55 [1.10-2.18]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (1.14 [0.85-1.54]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 1.43). Interpretation(s): Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

0	COVID-19-ASSOCIATED HYPERCOAGUABLE STATE: A CASE OF ACUTE AORTIC THROMBOSIS. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Reports during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have raised concerns for a hypercoagulable state.1 An increased incidence of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary microthrombi have been found on autopsy. We present a case of a spontaneous aortic thrombosis in a patient with SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old with dyspnea and fevers presented with hypoxia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and tested positive for Coronavirus-19. He was managed with high flow oxygen and was initiated on therapeutic heparin drip for atrial flutter. Laboratory results revealed elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin 932ng/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 43mm/hour, C-reactive protein of 227mg/L, IL-6 141pg/ml, fibrinogen 606mg/dL, D-Dimer of 1.08ug/mL). The patient was intubated on day three for worsening hypoxia. Bilateral mottled lower extremities were immediately noted, with non-palpable pulses and an arterial doppler confirming absent flow in both femoral arteries. The patient underwent emergent surgical exploration with the discovery of extensive abdominal aortic clot ex-tending into the bilateral femoral and renal arteries on intraoperative aortogram. Despite emergent thrombectomies, the muscle tissue demonstrated extensive non-viability, and bilateral above the knee amputations were performed. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with the development of rhabdomyolysis, severe shock, and acute renal failure. The family made a decision to pursue comfort care secondary to futility. DISCUSSION: Individuals with COVID-19 have a number of coagulation abnormalities. Direct invasion of endothelial cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, potentially leading to cell injury, in addition to other indirect mediators of endothelial injury (interleukin [IL]-6), other acute phase reactants and complement-mediated endothelial injury have been postulated to contribute to the hypercoagulable state and clot pathogenesis.2 COVID-19 has been widely accepted to lead to the development of venous and pulmonary micro-emboli. There are however less frequent reports of arterial thrombosis (strokes, acute coronary syndrome, acute limb ischemia).3 This case is the first report of an acute central arterial thrombosis likely secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in a patient who was already being treated with heparin. This may demonstrate resistance to anticoagulation, the etiology of which needs further investigation. CONCLUSION(S): Life-threatening arterial thromboses are likely within the spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 virus syn-drome. Serious consideration should be made to anticoagulate these patients to prevent clots with careful monitoring of the coagulation profile to ensure adequate protection. Reference #1: Klok FA et al.

0	"Picking up a Fight: Fine Tuning Mitochondrial Innate Immune Defenses Against RNA Viruses. As the world faces the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become an urgent need of the hour to understand how our immune system sense and respond to RNA viruses that are often life-threatening. While most vaccine strategies for these viruses are developed around a programmed antibody response, relatively less attention is paid to our innate immune defenses that can determine the outcome of a viral infection via the production of antiviral cytokines like Type I Interferons. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the ""cytokine storm"" induced by aberrant activation of the innate immune response against a viral pathogen may sometimes offer replicative advantage to the virus thus promoting disease pathogenesis. Thus, it is important to fine tune the responses of the innate immune network that can be achieved via a deeper insight into the candidate molecules involved. Several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the Toll like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) recognize cytosolic RNA viruses and mount an antiviral immune response. RLRs recognize invasive viral RNA produced during infection and mediate the induction of Type I Interferons via the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) molecule. It is an intriguing fact that the mitochondrion, one of the cell's most vital organelle, has evolved to be a central hub in this antiviral defense. However, cytokine responses and interferon signaling via MAVS signalosome at the mitochondria must be tightly regulated to prevent overactivation of the immune responses. This review focuses on our current understanding of the innate immune sensing of the host mitochondria by the RLR-MAVS signalosome and its specificity against some of the emerging/re-emerging RNA viruses like Ebola, Zika, Influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that may expand our understanding for novel pharmaceutical development.

0	Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A singlecenter experience from Wuhan. Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the health-care systems all over the world. Among the booming literatures about COVID-19, there is yet a paucity of study addressing the association between COVID-19 and cancer, which is a rare comorbidity of COVID-19, as well as consensus for treatment of cancer in this pandemic. Method(s): In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, information of all inpatient cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had treatment outcome were collected from the designated departments in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China on March 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Severe events were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result(s): A total of 716 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified. Among them, a total of 12 cases (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%) had history of cancer with 4 cases (33%) experienced severe events. Compared with cases without cancer, patients with cancer have higher risks of severe events (33% vs 7.7%, p=0.012) and deaths (25% vs 3.6%, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that cancer was independently associated with increased odds of severe events after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 6.51, 95% CI 1.72-24.64; p=0.006). Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, we found that patients older than 60 years (75%), with other comorbidities (50%), or experiencing anticancer treatment in past month (42.9%) had a numerically higher incidence of severe events. Conclusion(s): Cancer is a rare comorbidity of patients with COVID-19; however, it cannot be overemphasized due to its poorer outcomes. We propose that personalized treatment recommendation for cancer patients should be addressed during COVID-19 pandemic, along with meticulous personal protective protocols for them to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Ivyspring International Publisher.

Recently, various studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the ""doorknob"" that can be bound by the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which conduces to its entrance to the host cells, and plays an important role in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper aims to collect and sorts out the existing drugs, which exert the ability to block the binding of S protein and ACE2 so as to provide directions for the later drug development. By reviewing the existing literature, we expound the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of S protein and ACE2 binding, and summarize the drugs and compounds that can interfere with the interaction of spike protein and ACE2 receptor from different ways. We summarized five kinds of substances, including peptide P6, griffithsin, hr2p analogs, EK1, vaccine, monoclonal antibody, cholesterol-depleting agents, and extracts from traditional Chinese medicine. They can fight SARS-CoV-2 by specifically binding to ACE2 receptor, S protein, or blocking membrane fusion between the host and virus. ACE2 is the key point for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells, and it is also the focus of drug intervention. Our drug summary on this pathomechanism is expected to provide ideas for the drug research on SARS-CoV-2 and help to develop anti-coronavirus drugs of broad spectrum for future epidemics."	false
0	Care Homes and COVID-19 in Hong Kong: how the lessons from SARS were used to good effect. In Hong Kong, about 15% of older people (aged 80 and above) live in care homes, one of the highest proportions in the world. During the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the crude fatality rate for older people in care homes that were infected was 72%. After taking the advice of a team of international experts, the Hong Kong Government implemented comprehensive preventive measures to cope with the future epidemics. This commentary evaluates the effectiveness of these measures in coping with both influenza outbreaks and COVID-19 and suggests the lessons learnt are relevant to both developed and less developed countries? Lockdown in care homes is very effective under two conditions. Healthcare workers must wear surgical masks in the care home. Hospitals must adopt a strict policy to prevent virus transmission by discharged patients. Care homes situated within high-rise residential towers are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission; their residents can more easily be infected by asymptomatic carriers from the community. Airborne virus can also be transmitted more swiftly in care homes with open-plan layouts. Lockdown had been shown to significantly reduce influenza outbreaks in care homes. On the other hand, lockdown causes loneliness to residents. Care homes allow residents to move freely within the care home though with the risk of spreading the virus by resident who is an asymptomatic carrier. Finally, lockdown may cause family members to have guilty feelings. Family members can only make video call or window visit to residents. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Role of Biochemical Markers in Invasive Ventilation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: Multinomial Regression and Survival Analysis. Background and objectives Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease mainly affects the respiratory system of the patient, in particular, the lungs, which leads to patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure, with 5-15% of patients requiring observation in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory support in the form of ventilation. This study was aimed at identifying the role of biochemical markers in the risk stratification of invasive and non-invasive ventilation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study was conducted as a prospective, observational study of all admitted COVID-19 patients. A comparative analysis was performed of the survivors who were on invasive versus (vs) non-invasive ventilation and the non-survivors similarly. After computing the descriptive statistics, a multinomial logistic regression model was applied to obtain an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence interval (CI), with Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test used to predict the fitness of the data. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for each of the laboratory investigations predicting survival along with the intensive care stay and invasive ventilation. A log-rank test was carried out to compare the survival distributions. Results A total of 373 included patients in the study had a mean age of 52.78 +/- 15.76 years with females younger than males, and indifference amongst invasive vs non-invasively ventilated (p=0.821). Females were slightly more prone to invasive ventilation (p=0.097). Overall, 39% of the subjects did not need respiratory support, while 13% were on a ventilator, 16% on bilevel positive airway pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP), and 31% on supplemental oxygen therapy. Among the laboratory markers, mean hemoglobin was evidently lower in the invasive group, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were present in both invasively ventilated and non-surviving patients, while neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were statistically indifferent among the mode of ventilation. Elevated urea, creatinine, and sodium were also significantly deranged laboratory markers amongst the invasively ventilated group. C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated significantly in the invasive group, while serum ferritin was more frequently raised in the non-invasively ventilated group. Procalcitonin (PCT) was significantly associated with invasive ventilation as opposed to the non-invasive group. D-dimer was equally raised in both the groups at admission but significantly elevated in the invasive group at discharge. A multinomial regression model signified D-dimer (OR: 16.301), hypernatremia (OR: 12.738), creatinine (OR: 12.589), urea (OR: 12.576), and LDH (OR: 12.245) most significantly associated with death, while those for invasive ventilation were D-dimer (OR: 8.744), hypernatremia (OR: 4.532), PCT (OR: 3.829), neutrophilia (OR: 3.804), leukocytosis (OR: 3.330), and serum urea (OR: 3.312). Kaplan-Meier curves conclude total leucocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, urea, creatinine, sodium, CRP, LDH, PCT, and D-dimer all significantly contributing to an early death. Conclusion The most significant marker for mortality was D-dimer, followed by serum sodium, urea/creatinine, LDH, ICU stay, and invasive ventilation. Copyright © 2020, Asghar et al.	false
0	Implementation Science to Respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand globally, requiring massive public health responses from national and local governments. These bodies have taken heterogeneous approaches to their responses, including when and how to introduce and enforce evidence-based interventions-such as social distancing, hand-washing, personal protective equipment (PPE), and testing. In this commentary, we reflect on opportunities for implementation science to contribute meaningfully to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We reflect backwards on missed opportunities in emergency preparedness planning, using the example of PPE stockpiling and supply management; this planning could have been strengthened through process mapping with consensus-building, microplanning with simulation, and stakeholder engagement. We propose current opportunities for action, focusing on enhancing the adoption, fidelity, and sustainment of hand washing and social distancing; we can combine qualitative data, policy analysis, and dissemination science to inform agile and rapid adjustment to social marketing strategies to enhance their penetration. We look to future opportunities to enhance the integration of new evidence in decision-making, focusing on serologic and virologic testing systems; we can leverage simulation and other systems engineering modeling to identify ideal system structures. Finally, we discuss the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic challenges implementation science to become more rapid, rigorous, and nimble in its approach, and integrate with public health practice. In summary, we articulate the ways in which implementation science can inform, and be informed by, the COVID-19 pandemic, looking backwards, proposing actions for the moment, and approaches for the future.

0	The pharmacological development of direct acting agents for emerging needed therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was quickly identified as the causal pathogen leading to the outbreak of SARS-like illness all over the world. As the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic proceeds, many efforts are being dedicated to the development of diverse treatment strategies. Increasing evidence showed potential therapeutic agents directly acting against SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as interferon, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, viral entry blockers, neuraminidase inhibitor, vaccine, antibody agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, natural killer cells, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking inhibitor. To date, several direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have demonstrated promising in vitro and clinical efficacy.

0	Hypokalemia in hospitalized patients with pneumonia associated with COVID-19. Background. In 5-20 % cases, a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) can cause pneumonia and require hospitalization. There is a high incidence of hypokalemia among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To assess the frequency of hypokalemia among hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and its relationship with the severity of the disease. Design and methods. A cohort study included 43 patients with verified pneumonia caused by COVID-19. The level of potassium in venous blood was measured upon admission to the hospital. Differences in the levels of acute phase proteins, oxygen saturation, and the level of lung damage were compared between patients with and without hypokalemia. Results. The potassium level below 3,5 mmol/L was detected in 16 out of 43 patients (37,2 %), the median of potassium level in patients with hypokalemia was 2,9 (2,7-3,3) mmol/L. Patients with hypokalemia had a significantly lower oxygen saturation and higher percentage of lung tissue damage according to computed tomography: 91 (89-95) vs 96 (93-98)% (p = 0,001) and 64 (60-70) vs 48 (36-64)% (p = 0,019), respectively. Significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase were observed in patients with hypokalemia. Conclusions. Our results showed a high incidence of hypokalemia in hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Hypokalemia was positively associated with higher percentage of lung tissue damage and the levels of acute phase proteins.Copyright © 2020 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

0	Clinical Properties and Diagnostic Methods of COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancies: Meta-Analysis. We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published retrospective studies that examined data based on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by clinical symptoms, molecular (RT-PCR) diagnosis, and characteristic CT imaging features in pregnant women. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01/May/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug.

0	Positive Anti-SSA/Ro Antibody in a Woman with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Immunophenotyping: A Case Report. The clinical spectrum of novel coronavirus infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia, with respiratory failure and even death. Autoantibodies, especially antiphospholipid antibodies, can occur in severe infections. Other autoantibodies are seldom reported. Here, a 60-year-old female patient without dry-mouth symptoms detected positive for anti-60 kDa SSA/Ro antibodies on day 43 after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To investigate this unique clinical case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunological characteristics of this case were detected by using flow cytometry and were compared to the other three groups of patients-health subjects, 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recovery patients, and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) patients. Monitoring the autoantibody level and the development of subsequently related autoimmune diseases are warranted after SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Spontaneous Epidural Hematoma of the Cervical Spine in an Elderly Woman with Recent COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report. BACKGROUND This report presents the case of a woman with no known coagulopathy, use of anticoagulants, or history of trauma who spontaneously developed an epidural hematoma of the spine. This is an uncommon condition, with the potential for missed diagnosis and potential harm to the patient. CASE REPORT The patient was an elderly woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Of note, she had recently recovered from COVID-19. Because the woman presented with right-sided weakness and pain in the back of her neck, the stroke team was activated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her neck revealed a very subtle hyperdensity, which on further investigation was found to be an acute epidural hematoma at C2-C3 space through the C6 vertebra. While awaiting surgery, the patient had spontaneous improvement of her right-sided weakness and her condition eventually was managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is an uncommon condition, and a high index of suspicion is required to accurately diagnose and appropriately manage it. In the case presented here, the hematoma was subtle on the CT scan, and the patient's weakness easily could have been misdiagnosed as an ischemic stroke. That may have resulted in administration of thrombolytics, potentially causing significant harm. In addition, the patient had recently recovered from COVID-19 disease, which may or may not be incidental. Further observation will be required to determine if there is a spike in similar cases, which may be temporally associated with the novel coronavirus.	false
0	A Randomized Open label Phase-II Clinical Trial with or without Infusion of Plasma from Subjects after Convalescence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in High-Risk Patients with Confirmed Severe SARS-CoV-2 Disease (RECOVER): A structured summary of a study protocol. OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives * To assess the time from randomisation until an improvement within 84 days defined as two points on a seven point ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission by infusion of plasma from subjects after convalescence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or standard of care. Secondary objectives * To assess overall survival, and the overall survival rate at 28 56 and 84 days. * To assess SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. * To assess the percentage of patients that required mechanical ventilation. * To assess time from randomisation until discharge., TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, open-label, multicenter phase II trial, designed to assess the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 disease in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) following treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma or standard of care., PARTICIPANTS: High-risk patients >18 years of age hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 10-15 university medical centres will be included. High-risk is defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive infection with Oxygen saturation at <= 94% at ambient air with additional risk features as categorised in 4 groups: * Group 1, pre-existing or concurrent hematological malignancy and/or active cancer therapy (incl. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) within the last 24 months or less. * Group 2, chronic immunosuppression not meeting the criteria of group 1. * Group 3, age >= 50 - 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2 and at least one of these criteria: Lymphopenia < 0.8 x G/l and/or D-dimer > 1mug/mL. * Group 4, age >= 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2. Observation time for all patients is expected to be at least 3 months after entry into the study. Patients receive convalescent plasma for two days (day 1 and day 2) or standard of care. For patients in the standard arm, cross over is allowed from day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. Nose/throat swabs for determination of viral load are collected at day 0 and day 1 (before first CP administration) and subsequently at day 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 28 or until discharge. Serum for SARS-Cov-2 diagnostic is collected at baseline and subsequently at day 3, 7, 14 and once during the follow-up period (between day 35 and day 84). There is a regular follow-up of 3 months. All discharged patients are followed by regular phone calls. All visits, time points and study assessments are summarized in the Trial Schedule (see full protocol Table 1). All participating trial sites will be supplied with study specific visit worksheets that list all assessments and procedures to be completed at each visit. All findings including clinical and laboratory data are documented by the investigator or an authorized member of the study team in the patient's medical record and in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs)., INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: This trial will analyze the effects of convalescent plasma from recovered subjects with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients at high risk for a poor outcome due to underlying disease, age or condition as listed above are eligible for enrollment. In addition, eligible patients have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and O2 saturation <= 94% while breathing ambient air. Patients are randomised to receive (experimental arm) or not receive (standard arm) convalescent plasma in two bags (238 - 337 ml plasma each) from different donors (day 1, day 2). A cross over from the standard arm into the experimental arm is possible after day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition., MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoints: The main purpose of the study is to assess the time from randomisation until an improvement within 84 days defined as two points on a seven-point ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission by infusion of plasma from subjects after convalescence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or standard of care. Secondary endpoints: * Overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause 28-day, 56-day and 84-day overall survival rates. * SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. * Requirement mechanical ventilation at any time during hospital stay (yes/no). * Time until discharge from randomisation. * Viral load, changes in antibody titers and cytokine profiles are analysed in an exploratory manner using paired non-parametric tests (before - after treatment)., RANDOMISATION: Upon confirmation of eligibility (patients must meet all inclusion criteria and must not meet exclusion criteria described in section 5.3 and 5.4 of the full protocol), the clinical site must contact a centralized internet randomization system ( https://randomizer.at/ ). Patients are randomized using block randomisation to one of the two arms, experimental arm or standard arm, in a 1:1 ratio considering a stratification according to the 4 risk groups (see Participants)., BLINDING (MASKING): The study is open-label, no blinding will be performed., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total number of 174 patients is required for the entire trial, n=87 per group., TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.2 dated 09/07/2020.

0	Viral respiratory infections in very low birthweight infants at neonatal intensive care unit: prospective observational study. Background and objective: Very low birthweight (VLBW) infants are highly susceptible to respiratory infections. Information about prevalence of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is scarce. Recent evidence suggests short-term and long-term impact of VRI in morbidity of VLBW infants. The goal of this study is to conduct a VRI surveillance in VLBW infants during NICU admission to address the prevalence, type of viruses and associated clinical features., Methods: Prospective observational cohort study on infants below 32 gestational weeks admitted to a tertiary NICU during a 2-year period. Respiratory virus detection (influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus (hRV), enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus and adenovirus) was performed by real time multiplex PCR assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), within the first 72 hours after birth and weekly, until discharge. Additional samples were taken if clinically indicated., Results: 147 out of 224 eligible infants were enrolled. At least one positive NPA was found in 38% of the study cohort. Main viruses identified were hRV (58%) and adenovirus (31%). Among the 56 infants with positive NPA, 26 showed non-specific respiratory features in 58% (increased respiratory workload, tachypnoea, apnoea) or typical cold features in 38% (rhinorrhea, cough, fever), at least in one episode. Antibiotics were prescribed in 29% of cases. Positive infants showed higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and had longer hospital stay. Cox regression analysis found BPD as an independent risk factor for viral infection (p<0.001) and symptomatic VRI (p<0.04)., Conclusions: Systematic surveillance in VLBW infants reports VRI is frequent, particularly by hRV. Asymptomatic infection is highly prevalent which is critical in the face of establishing appropriate preventive strategies. Infants with BPD are especially vulnerable to such infections.

During the unprecedented coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, virtual education activities have become more prevalent than ever. One activity that many families have incorporated into their routines while at home is virtual storytime, with teachers, grandparents, and other remote adults reading books to children over video chat. The current study asks how dialogic reading over video chat compares to more traditional forms of book reading in promoting story comprehension and vocabulary learning. Fifty-eight 4-year-olds (M age = 52.7, SD = 4.04, 31 girls) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (Video chat, Live, and Prerecorded). Across conditions, children were read the same narrative storybook by a female experimenter who used the same 10 scripted dialogic reading prompts during book reading. In the Video chat (n = 21) and Live conditions (n = 18), the experimenter gave the scripted prompts and interacted naturally and contingently, responding in a timely, relevant manner to children's behaviors. In the Prerecorded condition (n = 19), children viewed a video of an experimenter reading the book. The Prerecorded condition was pseudo-contingent; the reader posed questions and paused for a set period of time as if to wait for a child's response. After reading, children completed measures of vocabulary and comprehension. Results revealed no differences between conditions across six different outcome measures, suggesting that children comprehended and learned from the story similarly across book formats. Further, children in the three experimental conditions scored significantly higher on measures than children in a fourth condition (control) who had never read the book, confirming that children learned from the three different book formats. However, children were more responsive to the prompts in the Live and Video chat conditions than the Prerecorded condition, suggesting that children recognized that these interactions were contingent with their responses, a feature that was lacking in the Prerecorded condition. Results indicate that children can comprehend books over video chat, suggesting that this technology is a viable option for reading to children, especially during the current pandemic.

0	Clinical characteristics of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China. Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Despite the growing number of patients with COVID-19 infection, data on the clinical characteristics of pregnant patients are still limited. Methods. We retrospectively included childbearing-age female patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 15 to February 23, 2020. Demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed. Clinical characteristics of pregnant and nonpregnant patients were compared. Results. One hundred eleven childbearing-age women with COVID-19 were included, including 16 patients (14.4%) with severe or critical disease. Compared with nonpregnant patients (n = 80), pregnant patients (n = 31) were less likely to have dyspnea (16.1% vs 37.5%), asthenia (3.2% vs 33.8%), and >=3 symptoms (22.6% vs 45.0%); had a significantly higher neutrophil count (5.2 vs 2.5 x109/L) and a higher percentage of CD3+ cells (76.7% vs 73.7%) and CD8+ cells (32.3% vs 28.4%); and had a dramatically lower percentage of lymphocytes (18.2% vs 31.8%), a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio (1.2 vs 1.4), and a lower level of IgG (9.8 vs 11.9 g/L). Of note, pregnant patients had a significantly lower percentage of severe disease (3.2% vs 18.8%) and a substantially higher level of inflammation markers including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (4.4 vs 1.9) and systematic inflammatory index (812.8 vs 354.7) than nonpregnant patients. Seventeen live births were recorded, and all of these showed negative results of postnatal COVID-19 detection together with a normal Apgar score. Conclusions. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 had a lower level of severity and an enhanced inflammatory response and cell immunity when compared with nonpregnant patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Covid-19 associated aspergillosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) may complicate severe COVID-19 patients. The incidence, although is not well confirmed, varies (20-35%) and the already recognized host factors for IPA in immunosuppressed patients are not identified in non-immunocom-promised patients with COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergil-losis (CAPA). Additionally, clinical characteristics and radiological findings are not specific. Given the probable high burden of the co-infection, a screening diagnostic work-up, including serum and BAL galactomannan measurement, fungal cultures of upper and lower respiratory tract samples are considered mandatory in all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

0	Artificial intelligence for rapid meta-analysis: Case study on ocular toxicity of hydroxychloroquine. Background: Rapid access to evidence is crucial in times of an evolving clinical crisis. To that end, we propose a novel approach to answer clinical queries, termed rapid meta-analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances a quick time to production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to strike this balance. Objective(s): We aimed to evaluate whether RMA can generate meaningful clinical insights, but crucially, in a much faster processing time than traditional meta-analysis, using a relevant, real-world example. Method(s): The development of our RMA approach was motivated by a currently relevant clinical question: Is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy? At the time of designing this study, hydroxychloroquine was a leading candidate in the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We then leveraged AI to pull and screen articles, automatically extract their results, review the studies, and analyze the data with standard statistical methods. Result(s): By combining AI with human analysis in our RMA, we generated a meaningful, clinical result in less than 30 minutes. The RMA identified 11 studies considering ocular toxicity as a side effect of hydroxychloroquine and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI 1.11%-9.96%). The heterogeneity across individual study findings was high, which should be taken into account in interpretation of the result. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate that a novel approach to meta-analysis using AI can generate meaningful clinical insights in a much shorter time period than traditional meta-analysis.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

0	Role of Vitamin D in Pathogenesis and Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection. ABTRACT Aim: To determine the vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 infection and its association with the severity and fatality of COVID-19 disease. Study Design: Descriptive cross sectional study Place and duration of study: Department of Internal Medicine Bolan Medical College Hospital Quetta from 1st March to 30th April 2020. Method(s): A total of 168 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, age ranged from 30 to 80 years of either gender were included. The brief medical history was taken and clinical examination were done. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs samples of patient for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were collected and sent to the hospital medical laboratory to detect COVID-19 infection by using real-time polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). Blood sample of each patient were also collected to detect the vitamin D3 levels. Result(s): Mean age of patients was 42.26+/-13.69 years, 94(56%) were males, while 74(44%) were females. Most of the patients were with age group of 31-50 years 80(47.6%). Regarding COVID-19 asymptomatic subjects were 139(82.73%), while 22(13.09%), 5(2.97%), 2(1.19%) cases were respectively suffering from mild, moderate and severe disease. Vit D deficiency was significantly associated with both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Conclusion(s): Vitamin D is having protective role in respiratory tract infections. Its administration in deficient individuals suffering from COVID-19 infection may boost the immune system and reduces the severity of COVID-19 infection Vitamin D supplementation might boost the immune system of COVID-19 patients and reduce severity of the disease in vitamin D deficient individuals.Copyright © 2020 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

0	Management changes for patients with endocrine-related cancers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantial management changes in endocrine-related malignancies have been required as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a draconian reduction in the screening of asymptomatic subjects, delay in planned surgery and radiotherapy for primary tumors deemed to be indolent, and dose reductions and/or delays in initiation of some systemic therapies. An added key factor has been a patient-initiated delay in the presentation because of the fear of viral infection. Patterns of clinical consultation have changed, including a greater level of virtual visits, physical spacing, masking, staffing changes to ensure a COVID-free population and significant changes in patterns of family involvement. While this has occurred to improve safety from COVID-19 infection, the implications for cancer outcomes have not yet been defined. Based on prior epidemics and financial recessions, it is likely that delayed presentation and treatment of high-grade malignancy will be associated with worse cancer outcomes. Cancer patients are also at increased risk from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. Pandemic management strategies for patients with tumors of breast, prostate, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal gland are reviewed.Copyright © 2020 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.	false

0	ESPGHAN 'biopsy-sparing' guidelines for celiac disease in children with low antitransglutaminase during COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Recent guidelines for celiac disease have allowed a biopsy-free approach in endomysial antibodies (EMAs) positive children with high antitransglutaminase (TGA-IgA) titer [>10 time upper limit of normal (ULN)]. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is still necessary for diagnosis in children with lower title. Because elective pediatric endoscopy has been substantially shouted down during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many children remained undiagnosed - and therefore untreated - for a long time. We aimed to analyze the feasibility and accuracy of a biopsy-free approach in suspected celiac disease children with TGA-IgA values <10 ULN to facilitate the diagnostic process by avoiding endoscopy., METHODS: In this study cohort, we retrospectively analyzed all biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease in our center (between 2014 and 2019). The positive predictive value (PPV) of TGA-IgA titers between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA in diagnosing celiac disease were determined. Mucosal atrophy and resolution of symptoms after gluten-free diet (GFD) were considered to confirm initial diagnosis., RESULTS: Of 430 celiac disease patients (F: 274; mean age 7.54 years) diagnosed by endoscopy, 84 (F: 46; mean age 8 years) with TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA were identified. The PPV of TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.90-0.96). All these children had a symptom resolution and antibodies normalization after GFD., CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a temporarily reduction of the TGA-IgA threshold for biopsy-sparing approach seems feasible in EMA positive children with TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN.	false
0	COVID-19 surveillance in Southeastern Virginia using wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been used to analyze markers in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent to characterize emerging chemicals, drug use patterns, or disease spread within communities. This approach can be particularly helpful in understanding outbreaks of disease like the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) when combined with clinical datasets. In this study, three RT-ddPCR assays (N1, N2, N3) were used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in weekly samples from nine WWTPs in southeastern Virginia. In the first several weeks of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 detections were sporadic. Frequency of detections and overall concentrations of RNA within samples increased from mid March into late July. During the twenty-one week study, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 101 to 104 copies 100 mL-1 in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, it is likely that communities will see increased incidence of small, localized outbreaks. In these instances, WBE could be used as a pre-screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Understanding the Role of Corona Virus based on Current Scientific Evidence - a Review with Emerging Important in Pandemic. Coronavirus disease is a potentially deadly disease and of significant apprehension for global communal health potentially because of its lethality. Vaccines and antiviral medications are still under trial to prevent or treat infections of human coronavirus (HCoV) till date. The virus HCoV originate in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes respiratory syndrome having distinctive pathogenesis and causes infections of the respiratory tract. A mechanism was projected for the evolution of SARS virus and a handy association with bats was found. When this virus reaches respective host system, infection starts with spike protein binding to its complementary receptor of the host cell. The coronavirus spike protein's association with its host cell receptor complement is crucial in deciding the virus infectivity, tissue tropism and species variety. Recent studies show that SARS Coronavirus 2 or COVID-19 requires protease to get into cells, offering a new therapeutic target. Distinctive attention and exertions should be given to defending or reducing transmission in vulnerable populaces, including those directly associated with caregiving and treatment and also aged one. Researchers are planning to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 and in this approach are also considered developing a vaccine that sensitizes our immune system preventing from this pandemic. The present review focuses on the role of S-spike protein in COVID-19 which helps the virus intruder the enzyme ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Passive antibody therapy is an additional alternate that purposes to use blood donors from hale and hearty people who have already recovered from COVID-19 and therapeutic advancement in handling COVID-19 pandemic.

0	National survey on the treatment of acute appendicitis in Spain during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Spanish hospitals, which have had to allocate all available resources to treat these patients, reducing the ability to attend other common pathologies. The aim of this study is to analyze how the treatment of acute appendicitis has been affected., METHOD: A national descriptive study was carried out by a online voluntary distribution of a specific questionnaire with Google Drive TM distributed by email by the Spanish Association of Surgeons (AEC) to all affiliated surgeons actually working in Spain (5203) opened from April 14th to April 24th., RESULTS: We received 337 responses from 170 centers. During the first month of the pandemic the incidence of acute appendicitis has decreased. Although conservative management has increased, surgical option has been the most used in both simple and complicated appendicitis. Despite the fact that the laparoscopic approach continues to be the most widely used in our services, the open approach has increased during this pandemic period., CONCLUSION: Highlight the contribution of this study in terms of knowledge of the status of the treatment of acute appendicitis during this first month of the pandemic, being able to serve for a better possible organization in future waves of the pandemic and a reorganization of current protocols and management of acute appendicitis in a pandemic situation.

0	Clinical Manifestations and Outcomes of Critically Ill Children and Adolescents with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in New York City. Objectives: To describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of critically ill children with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in New York City. Study design: Retrospective observational study of children 1 month to 21 years admitted March 14 to May 2, 2020, to 9 New York City pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Result(s): Of 70 children admitted to PICUs, median age was 15 (IQR 9, 19) years; 61.4% male; 38.6% Hispanic; 32.9% black; and 74.3% with comorbidities. Fever (72.9%) and cough (71.4%) were the common presenting symptoms. Twelve patients (17%) met severe sepsis criteria; 14 (20%) required vasopressor support; 21 (30%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 9 (12.9%) met acute kidney injury criteria; 1 (1.4%) required renal-replacement therapy, and 2 (2.8%) had cardiac arrest. For treatment, 27 (38.6%) patients received hydroxychloroquine; 13 (18.6%) remdesivir; 23 (32.9%) corticosteroids; 3 (4.3%) tocilizumab; and 1 (1.4%) anakinra; no patient was given immunoglobulin or convalescent plasma. Forty-nine (70%) patients required respiratory support: 14 (20.0%) noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (28.6%) invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 7 (10%) prone position, 2 (2.8%) inhaled nitric oxide, and 1 (1.4%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine (45%) of the 20 patients requiring IMV were extubated by day 14 with median IMV duration of 218 (IQR 79, 310.4) hours. Presence of ARDS was significantly associated with duration of PICU and hospital stay, and lower probability of PICU and hospital discharge at hospital day 14 (P < .05 for all). Conclusion(s): Critically ill children with COVID-19 predominantly are adolescents, have comorbidities, and require some form of respiratory support. The presence of ARDS is significantly associated with prolonged PICU and hospital stay.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Incidence, pattern and severity of abnormal liver blood tests among hospitalised patients with SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) in South Wales. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and since become a global pandemic. As such, its clinical behaviour is a subject of much interest. Initial reports suggested a significant proportion of patients have abnormal liver blood tests. Gwent has experienced one of the highest incidences of COVID-19 infection in the UK, which itself has among the highest COVID-19 impacts worldwide. Method(s): We set out to report the incidence, clinical pattern and severity of liver blood test abnormalities in hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution over a 3-week period. Data on clinical outcomes such as admission to intensive therapy unit (ITU), hospital discharge and mortality were recorded. Result(s): 318 hospitalised COVID-19 positive had liver blood tests available for analysis. Ninety-seven patients (31%) had one or more abnormal liver blood tests and were abnormal admission in 64%. Liver tests were predominantly cholestatic (72%) in contrast to other studies to date. Male gender and abnormal liver blood tests were associated with ITU admission. Conclusion(s): Almost one-third of admissions with COVID-19 have abnormal LBTs which are typically mild and are associated with male gender. Importantly, we have identified that cholestatic patterns dominate but were not clearly associated with ITU admission or death.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

0	A simple protein-based surrogate neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mount a humoral immune response to the virus within a few weeks of infection, but the duration of this response and how it correlates with clinical outcomes has not been completely characterized. Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay serves as a surrogate neutralization assay and is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD, enabling a direct comparison. The results obtained with our assay correlate with those of two viral based assays, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that uses live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a spike pseudotyped viral-vector-based assay.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the current pandemic. Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4-5 month-old cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding for 21 DPC. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principals and sentinels, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling. The results of this study are critical for understanding the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment of the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 in felines and transmission to other animals and humans.	false
0	"Reducing false negatives in COVID-19 testing by using microneedle-based oropharyngeal swabs. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe threat to human health worldwide. Early etiological diagnosis plays a critical role in controlling COVID-19 pandemic. However, etiological diagnosis has been largely compromised by high ""false negative"" rates of viral nucleic acid testing, resulting from limited sampling efficiency using conventional oropharyngeal swabs. Herein, we engineer regular swabs by using a microneedle (MN) patch to significantly improve the quality and quantity of virus collection. The combination of MNs with different crosslinking levels endows the patches with dual capability of mucus penetration and virus extraction. Moreover, the antibody (Ab) against viral spike protein was integrated into the patch, conferring MNs with an active virus capture potential. By taking advantage of the biological and engineered species, it is believed the designed MN/Ab swabs could serve as a promising tool to improve current sampling efficiency with less ""false negatives"", contributing to the containment of COVID-19 pandemic."	false

Frequency of hand disinfection and adverse skin reactions among health care workers dramatically increased since the COVID-19 outbreak and consensus recommendations on hand hygiene were presented. The aim of the present study was to check the efficacy of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Task Force (TF) on Contact Dermatitis (CD) recommendations in a real life and to search if providing products mentioned in that recommendations may increase its efficacy. Doctors and nurses who worked with patients during COVID-19 pandemic and use hand disinfectants received adopted recommendations of the EADV TF on CD only or together with mentioned in that recommendations gel with ethanol and glycerin and emollient. Prevalence of adverse skin reactions on hand disinfectants at baseline was 80.21%. In a month significant improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and self-assessed improvement of hand skin (P<0.01 for both) was reported in ""products"" group only. Number of participants that had no impact on their HRQoL became higher and the Dermatology Life Quality Index scores lower than in ""recommendations only"" group ( P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). Our results showed that recommendations of the EADV TF on CD may significantly improve HRQoL and hand skin status in health care professionals but provision with products mentioned in that recommendations is crucial.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2), gamma-interferon-inducible lysosome/endosome-localized thiolreductase (GILT), and lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E (LY6E), the three cellular proteins identified to function in interference with virus entry, were expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-O43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) restriction of human coronavirus (CoV) entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a mechanism distinct from other factors that modulate CoV entry. IMPORTANCE Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control of host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon-inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH, and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as a host factor that facilitates the entry of several human-pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.Copyright © 2020 Zhao et al.

We aimed to analyze outcomes of lung cancer patients affected by COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital of a high-incidence region during the pandemic. Method(s): We annotated 23 lung cancer patients consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution (HGUGM; Madrid, Spain) between March 4th, 2020 and May 12th, 2020. Only patients with a confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were included in the study. Result(s): All patients had at least 1 COVID-19 related symptom; cough (48%), shortness of breath (48%), fever (39%), and low-grade fever (30%) were the most common. Time from symptoms onset to first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR was 5.5 days (range 1-17), with 13% of cases needed from a 2nd PCR to confirm diagnosis. There was a high variability on thoracic imaging findings, with multilobar pneumonia as the most commonly found pattern (74%). Main lab test abnormalities were low lymphocytes count (87%), high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio -NLR- (78%), and elevated inflammatory markers: fibrinogen (91%), c-reactive protein -CRP- (87%), and D-dimer (70%). In our series, hospitalization rate was 74%, 39% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the case-fatality rate was 35% (8/23). 87% of patients received anti-viral treatment (87% hydroxychloroquine, 74% lopinavir/ritonavir, 13% azithromycin), 43% corticosteroids, 26% interferon-beta, 4% tocilizumab, and 82% of hospitalized patients received anticoagulation. High-oxygen requirements were needed in 39% of patients, but only 1 pt was admitted for invasive MV and was discharged 42 days after admission. Multiple variables related to tumor status, clinical baseline conditions, and inflammation markers were associated with mortality but did not remain statistically significant in a multivariate model. In patients with lung cancer receiving systemic therapy (n = 242) incidence and mortality from COVID-19 were 4.5, and 2.1%, respectively, with no differences found by type of treatment. Conclusion(s): Lung cancer patients represent a vulnerable population for COVID-19, according to the high rate of hospitalization, onset of ARDS, and high mortality rate. Although larger series are needed, no differences in mortality were found by type of cancer treatment. Measures to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain key to protect lung cancer patients.© Copyright © 2020 Calles, Aparicio, Alva, Bringas, Gutierrez, Soto, Arregui, Tirado, Alvarez, del Monte-Millan, Massarrah, Galera, Alvarez and Martin.	false
0	Blocking of the High-Affinity Interaction-Synapse Between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 Proteins Likely Requires Multiple High-Affinity Antibodies: An Immune Perspective. The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has induced global eagerness to develop vaccines and therapeutics for treating COVID-19, including neutralizing antibodies. To develop effective therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to understand the interaction between viral and host's proteins. The human ACE2 (hACE2) protein is the crucial target for the SARS-CoV's Spike protein that allows the virus to adhere to host epithelial cells. X-ray crystal structures and biophysical properties of protein-protein interactions reveal a large interaction surface with high binding-affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 (18 interactions), at least 15-fold stronger than between SARS-CoV-1 and hACE2 (eight interactions). This suggests that antibodies against CoV-1 infection might not be very efficient against CoV-2. Furthermore, interspecies comparisons indicate that ACE2 proteins of man and cat are far closer than dog, ferret, mouse, and rat with significant differences in binding-affinity between Spike and ACE2 proteins. This strengthens the notion of productive SARS-CoV-2 transmission between felines and humans and that classical animal models are not optimally suited for evaluating therapeutic antibodies. The large interaction surface with strong affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 (dG-12.4) poses a huge challenge to develop reliable antibody therapy that truly blocks SARS-CoV-2 adherence and infection. We gauge that single antibodies against single epitopes might not sufficiently interfere with the strong interaction-synapse between Spike and hACE2 proteins. Instead, appropriate combinations of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against different epitopes might be needed, preferably of IgA-class for optimal and prolonged activity at epithelial layers of respiratory and intestine tracts.© Copyright © 2020 Khatri, Staal and van Dongen.	false
0	The metabolic and immunological characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates. Our aim was to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection raised high risks of late pregnancy complications, and posed health problems in fetuses and neonates. We analyzed the data of COVID-19 pregnant women with COVID-19 during late pregnancy and their neonates. Eleven out of 16 (69%) pregnant women with COVID-19 had ++ or +++ of ketone body in urine. The blood uric acid of pregnant patients was 334 mumol/L (IQR, 269-452). D-dimer and FDP in pregnant patients were 3.32 mg/L (IQR, 2.18-4.21) and 9.6 mg/L (IQR, 5.9-12.4). Results of blood samples collected at birth showed that 16 neonates had leukocytes (15.7 x 109/L (IQR, 13.7-17.2)), neutrophils (11.1 x 109/L (IQR, 9.2-13.2)), CK (401 U/L (IQR, 382-647)), and LDH (445 U/L (IQR, 417-559)). Twenty-four hours after birth, a neonate from COVID-19 woman had fever and positive of SARS-CoV-2 gene. Another woman had strongly positive for SARS-CoV-2 gene (+++) for 4 weeks, and delivered one neonate who had SARS-CoV-2 IgM (46 AU/mL) and IgG (140 AU/mL) on day 1 after birth. In the third trimester, COVID-19 infection in pregnant patients raised high risks of ketonuria, hypercoagulable state, and hyperfibrinolysis, which may lead to severe complications. COVID-19 increased the inflammatory responses of placenta, and fetuses and neonates had potential organ dysregulation and coagulation disorders. There was a potential intrauterine transmission while pregnant women had high titer of SARS-CoV-2, but it is necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the blood cord, placenta, and amniotic fluid to further confirm intrauterine infection of fetuses.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients with re-detectable positive RNA test. Background: The characteristics, significance and potential cause of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients post discharge (re-detectable positive, RP) remained elusive. Method(s): A total of 262 COVID-19 patients discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020 were enrolled into this study. RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to disease severity, and the characterization at re-admission was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were measured, and all patients were followed up for at least 14 days, with a cutoff date of March 10, 2020. Result(s): A total of 14.5% of RP patients were detected. These patients were characterized as young and displayed mild and moderate conditions compared to NRP patients while no severe patients were RP. RP patients displayed fewer symptoms but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization compared to NRP patients. Upon hospital readmission, these patients showed no obvious symptoms or disease progression. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for viral RNA and showed no suspicious symptoms. Eighteen out of 24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested positive for viral RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting that these patients were potential carriers of the virus after recovery from COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Our results indicated that young patients, with a mild diagnosis of COVID-19 are more likely to display RP status after discharge. These patients show no obvious symptoms or disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients. Our findings provide information and evidence for the management of convalescent COVID-19 patients.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	"Prevalence of Voice Disorders in Healthcare Workers in the Universal Masking COVID-19 Era. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of voice disorders in healthcare workers of high-risk hospital care units during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., METHODS: Questionnaire survey to healthcare personnel of COVID-19 high-risk hospital units was conducted, regarding demographic data, clinical activity, the pattern of usage of personal protective equipment, medical and vocal history, vocal symptoms, and Spanish validated Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 questionnaire., RESULTS: A total of 221 healthcare workers answered the survey. Nearly 33% of them reported having trouble with their voice during the last month, and 26.24% had an abnormal score in the Spanish validated VHI-10 questionnaire. The mean VHI-10 score was 7.92 (95% confidence interval 6.98-8.85). The number of working hours, the number of hours of mask daily use, simultaneous surgical and self-filtering mask use, and working in intermediate or intensive care units were independent variables significantly associated with a higher VHI-10 score., CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers of high-risk hospital care units during the universal masking COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of voice disorders., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 2020.

0	Investigation on sleep and mental health of patients with Parkinson's disease during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting sleep quality and mental health, especially in individuals with chronic disease such as Parkinson's disease (PD)., METHODS: We conducted a quantitative study, which included 119 Chinese PD patients who had been treated in an outpatient neurology clinic in Wuhan and 169 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The questionnaire survey focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, mental status, symptoms, and daily life and medical treatment of PD patients., RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, PD patients had significantly higher scores in both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (8.13 vs 5.36, p < 0.001) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -Depression (4.89 vs 3.82, p = 0.022), as well as a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 5 points (68.9% vs 44.4%, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance was identified in 68.9% of PD patients. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance of PD patients was independently associated with exacerbation of PD symptoms (OR = 3.616, 95%CI= (1.479, 8.844), p = 0.005) and anxiety (OR = 1.379, 95%CI= (1.157, 1.642), p < 0.001). Compared to male PD patients, female ones had higher PSQI scores (9.28 +/- 4.41 vs 7.03 +/- 4.01, p = 0.009) and anxiety (32.8% vs 0.1%, p = 0.002) and depression prevalence (34.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.003)., CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study emphasize the importance of mental and sleep health interventions in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional attention should be paid to the difficulty encountered by PD patients in seeking medical treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and young people. Though recent reports link SARS-CoV-2 infections with hyper-inflammatory states in children, most children experience no/mild symptoms, and hospitalization and mortality rates are low in the age group. As symptoms are usually mild and seroconversion occurs at low frequencies, it remains unclear whether children significantly contribute to community transmission. Several hypotheses try to explain age-related differences in disease presentation and severity. Possible reasons for milder presentations in children as compared to adults include frequent contact to seasonal coronaviruses, presence of cross-reactive antibodies, and/or co-clearance with other viruses. Increased expression of ACE2 in young people may facilitate virus infection, while limiting inflammation and reducing the risk of severe disease. Further potential factors include recent vaccinations and a more diverse memory T cell repertoire. This manuscript reviews age-related host factors that may protect children from COVID-19 and complications associated, and addresses the confusion around seropositivity and immunity.

0	Clinical features of patients with type 2 diabetes with and without Covid-19: a case control study (CoViDiab I). AIMS: To evaluate whether subjects with diabetes hospitalized for Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) represent a subgroup of patients with high-risk clinical features compared to patients with diabetes without Covid-19., METHODS: In this case-control study 79 patients with type 2 diabetes out of 354 adults hospitalized for Covid-19 and 158 controls with type 2 diabetes but without Covid-19, matched for age and gender, were enrolled. Medical history and concomitant therapies were retrieved from medical charts and compared between cases and controls, controlling for confounders., RESULTS: Fully-adjusted multivariate logistic regression model showed that previous CVD history did not differ between patients with and without Covid-19 (odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-3.32, p=0.45). A higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 3.72, 95%CI: 1.42-9.72, p=0.007) and of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 3.08, 95%CI: 1.18-8.06, p=0.022) and a lower prevalence of ever smokers (OR 0.30, 95%CI: 0.13-0.67, p=0.003), of users of lipid lowering agents (OR 0.26, 95%CI: 0.12-0.54, p<0.001), and of anti-hypertensive drugs (OR 0.39, 95%CI: 0.16-0.93, p=0.033) were found among cases., CONCLUSIONS: CVD prevalence does not differ between people with diabetes with and without Covid-19 requiring hospitalization. An increased prevalence of COPD and of CKD in Covid-19 patients with type 2 diabetes is suggested. These findings aid to clarify the relationship between underlying conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the high-risk group of patients with diabetes. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Incidence, features, outcome and impact on health system of de-novo abdominal surgical diseases in patients admitted with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: to assess the epidemiology and features of de novo surgical diseases in patients admitted with COVID-19, and their impact on patients and healthcare system., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastrointestinal involvement has been described in COVID-19; however, no clear figures of incidence, epidemiology and economic impact exist for de-novo surgical diseases in hospitalized patients., METHODS: This is a prospective study including all patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR, between 1 March and 15 May 2020 at two Tertiary Hospitals. Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation., RESULTS: Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay (LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days, p = 0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p = 0.0004). A median of two post-surgical complications were registered for each patient undergoing surgery. Complication-associated costs were as high as 38,962 USD per patient., CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of de-novo surgical diseases is low in COVID-19, but it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Future studies should elucidate the mechanism underlying the condition and identify strategies to prevent the need for surgery.

0	Risk factors associated with adverse fetal outcomes in pregnancies affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a secondary analysis of the WAPM study on COVID-19. Objectives To evaluate the strength of association between maternal and pregnancy characteristics and the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnancies with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Methods Secondary analysis of a multinational, cohort study on all consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 from 73 centers from 22 different countries. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite adverse fetal outcome, defined as the presence of either abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestations), stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 22 weeks of gestation), neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within the first 28 days of life), and perinatal death (either stillbirth or neonatal death). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate parameters independently associated with the primary outcome. Logistic regression was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30.6+/-9.5 weeks, with 8.0% of women being diagnosed in the first, 22.2% in the second and 69.8% in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were six miscarriage (2.3%), six intrauterine device (IUD) (2.3) and 5 (2.0%) neonatal deaths, with an overall rate of perinatal death of 4.2% (11/265), thus resulting into 17 cases experiencing and 226 not experiencing composite adverse fetal outcome. Neither stillbirths nor neonatal deaths had congenital anomalies found at antenatal or postnatal evaluation. Furthermore, none of the cases experiencing IUD had signs of impending demise at arterial or venous Doppler. Neonatal deaths were all considered as prematurity-related adverse events. Of the 250 live-born neonates, one (0.4%) was found positive at RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs performed after delivery. The mother was tested positive during the third trimester of pregnancy. The newborn was asymptomatic and had negative RT-PCR test after 14 days of life. At logistic regression analysis, gestational age at diagnosis (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.8-0.9 per week increase; p<0.001), birthweight (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.12.7 per 100 g decrease; p=0.012) and maternal ventilatory support, including either need for oxygen or CPAP (OR: 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.9; p=0.001) were independently associated with composite adverse fetal outcome. Conclusions Early gestational age at infection, maternal ventilatory supports and low birthweight are the main determinants of adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses with maternal COVID-19 infection. Conversely, the risk of vertical transmission seems negligible.	false
0	"Rationing in a Pandemic: Lessons from Italy. In late February and early March 2020, Italy became the European epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite increasingly stringent containment measures enforced by the government, the health system faced an enormous pressure, and extraordinary efforts were made in order to increase overall hospital beds' availability and especially ICU capacity. Nevertheless, the hardest-hit hospitals in Northern Italy experienced a shortage of ICU beds and resources that led to hard allocating choices. At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations aimed at supporting physicians in prioritizing patients when the number of critically ill patients overwhelm the capacity of ICUs. One motivating concern for the SIAARTI guidance was that, if no balanced and consistent allocation procedures were applied to prioritize patients, there would be a concrete risk for unfair choices, and that the prevalent ""first come, first served"" principle would lead to many avoidable deaths. Among the drivers of decision for admission to ICUs, age, comorbidities, and preexisting functional status were included. The recommendations were criticized as ageist and potentially discriminatory against elderly patients. Looking forward to the next steps, the Italian experience can be relevant to other parts of the world that are yet to see a significant surge of COVID-19: the need for transparent triage criteria and commonly shared values give the Italian recommendations even greater legitimacy.

0	Skin manifestations in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 disease: a cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations have been recently described and classified in five different clinical patterns, including acral erythema-edema (pseudo-chilblain), maculopapular exanthemas, vesicular eruptions, urticarial lesions, and livedo or necrosis., OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the skin of hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 disease and describe the real prevalence of skin manifestations., METHODS: A cross-sectional study, which included hospitalized patients in Cruces University Hospital from April 14-30, 2020, with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (with polymerase chain reaction and/or serology tests), was conducted. Entire body surface examination was performed by experienced dermatologists to search for cutaneous manifestations related to COVID-19 disease., RESULTS: From a sample of 75 patients, 14 (18.7%) developed cutaneous manifestations possibly related to COVID-19. We found six patients with acral erythema-edema (pseudo-chilblain) (42.8%), four patients with maculopapular exanthemas (28.6%), two patients with urticarial lesions (14.3%), one patient with livedo reticularis-like lesions (7.15%), and one patient with vesicular eruption (7.15%)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a more plausible relationship between the main cutaneous patterns and COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as all of them had a confirmatory laboratory test. Skin manifestations are frequent but mild with spontaneous resolution. These findings are nonspecific and can be similar to other viral infections and adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients.

0	The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities. COVID-19 constitutes the largest pandemic in the last 100 years. In view of the rapid spread of the virus, it is necessary to study the sociodemographic characteristics, hygiene habits, activity and mobility, and comorbidities of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be able to implement prevention strategies. For this purpose, a survey including the variables of interest was designed to try to understand the exponential spread of the virus despite the implemented severe restrictive mobility measures during the period of maximum confinement in Spain. This study conducted throughout the Spanish territory aims to clarify other routes of transmission of the COVID-19 during confinement, risk factors, and the effectiveness of the recommended hygiene measures to detect critical points of exposure to the virus and thus reduce its spread in this and possible future pandemics that could compromise public health. Our results show that living with a COVID-19 patient increased the risk of contagion by 60 times. Among all the sociodemographic variables analyzed, walking the dog have shown to have the strongest effect by increasing the risk by 78%. The most effective hygiene measure reducing the prevalence of the disease was the disinfection of products purchased from the market upon arrival home (which reduced the risk by 94%), above other hygiene measures, such as wearing masks, gloves, ethanol disinfection, bleaching and others. The mobility variable studied that showed the largest increase in the prevalence of the disease was working on site at the workplace (increased the risk by 76%). A significant higher prevalence of the disease was also detected among respondents who used the modality of acquiring basic commodities using home delivery service compared to those who chose in-store shopping.

0	Elevated plasma sTIM-3 levels in severe Covid-19 patients. BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still incompletely understood, but seems to involve immune activation and immune dysregulation., OBJECTIVE: We examined parameters of activation of different leukocyte subsets in COVID-19 infected patients in relation to disease severity., METHODS: We analyzed plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO, neutrophil activation), soluble (s) CD25 and soluble T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3 (sTIM-3) (markers of T cell activation and exhaustion) and sCD14 and sCD163 (markers of monocyte/macrophage activation) in 39 COVID-19 infected patients at hospital admission and two additional times during the first 10 days in relation to the need for ICU treatment., RESULTS: Our major findings were: (i) Severe clinical outcome (ICU) was associated with high plasma levels sTIM-3 and MPO suggesting activated and potentially exhausted T cells and activated neutrophils, respectively. (ii) In contrast, sCD14 and sCD163 showed no association with need for ICU treatment. (iii) sCD25, sTIM-3 and MPO were inversely correlated with the degree of respiratory failure as assessed by P/F ratio and positively correlated with the cardiac marker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that neutrophil activation and in particular activated T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection, suggesting that T cell targeted treatment options and downregulation of neutrophil activation could be of importance in this disorder.

0	Association of Hypertension with All-Cause Mortality among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. It is unclear to which extent the higher mortality associated with hypertension in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is due to its increased prevalence among older patients or to specific mechanisms. Cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study, analyzing 12226 patients who required hospital admission in 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics of survivors versus non-survivors. The mean age of the study population was 67.5 +/- 16.1 years, 42.6% were women. Overall, 2630 (21.5%) subjects died. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (50.9%) followed by diabetes (19.1%), and atrial fibrillation (11.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for gender (males, OR: 1.5, p = 0.0001), age tertiles (second and third tertiles, OR: 2.0 and 4.7, p = 0.0001), and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (second and third tertiles, OR: 4.7 and 8.1, p = 0.0001), hypertension was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality when this comorbidity was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR: 1.6, p = 0.002) or other than renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers (OR: 1.3, p = 0.001) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR: 1.2, p = 0.035). The preexisting condition of hypertension had an independent prognostic value for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization. ARBs showed a lower risk of lethality in hypertensive patients than other antihypertensive drugs.	false
0	Genomic and phylogenetic characterisation of an imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas State, Brazil. A new coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] is currently causing a life-threatening pandemic. In this study, we report the complete genome sequencing and genetic characterisation of a SARS-CoV-2 detected in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, and the protocol we designed to generate high-quality SARS-CoV-2 full genome data. The isolate was obtained from an asymptomatic carrier returning from Madrid, Spain. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed a total of nine mutations in comparison with the original human case in Wuhan, China, and support this case as belonging to the recently proposed lineage A.2. Phylogeographic analysis further confirmed the likely European origin of this case. To our knowledge, this is the first SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained from the North Brazilian Region. We believe that the information generated in this study may contribute to the ongoing efforts toward the SARS-CoV-2 emergence.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic adult cancer patients before initiating systemic treatments: a systematic review. Introduction: Cancer patients may have a higher risk of severe events and unfavourable outcomes in the setting of COVID-19. This review addresses the question of whether to test asymptomatic cancer patients before initiating systemic cancer treatments. Methods: This systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA framework. Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched, as well as guidelines from international institutions involved in cancer care and COVID-19 research. Studies published in English, from 1 December 2019 to 27 May 2020 were considered eligible. We included studies which mentioned testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic cancer patients before starting immunosuppressive treatments. Results: We identified 1,163 studies and 4 guidelines through the literature search. A total of 18 articles were considered eligible and were included in the final analysis. Two articles were cohort studies, and the remaining were expert consensuses and published guidelines. The most common recommendation among the studies in this systematic review was to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment. Conclusion: There is a lack of studies which directly address COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic patients before treatment. Our systematic review showed that most of the published data favours routine test for SARS-CoV-2 before initiating systemic treatment but failed to identify a good level of evidence to support these recommendations. Based upon this review, we proposed local recommendations at our centre. Each institution should consider the pros and cons of testing asymptomatic patients, evaluating accessibility to testing resources and local epidemiology.	false
0	Analysis of community-acquired COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: The demographic characteristics and transmission dynamics of the community-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Taiwan were analysed for more effective control and prevention of the community transmission of this novel disease. METHOD(S): Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020 in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULT(S): Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1 to 13 days) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3 to 24 days). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from pre-symptomatic cases, eleven cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and two cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging. Protective measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand washing are mandatory to prevent community transmission.	false
0	COVID-19: dealing with a potential risk factor for chronic neurological disorders. SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a complex clinical syndrome, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose main consequences are severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations (encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome) is increasingly reported in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and tissue colonization in the gut and the central nervous system, and the systemic inflammatory response during COVID-19 may potentially trigger chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy present several pathogenic mechanisms that can be hypothetically initiated by SARS-CoV2 infection in susceptible individuals. In this short narrative review, we summarize the clinical evidence supporting the rationale for investigating SARS-CoV2 infection as risk factor for these neurological disorders, and suggest the opportunity to perform in the future SARS-CoV2 serology when diagnosing these disorders.	false
0	Systematic review of COVID-19 related myocarditis: Insights on management and outcome. INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also referred to as COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The manifestations of COVID-19 are widely variable and range from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death. Like other viral illnesses, acute myocarditis has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 infection. However, guidelines for the diagnosis of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established., METHODS: Using a combination of search terms in the PubMed/Medline, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Library databases and manual searches on Google Scholar and the bibliographies of articles identified, we reviewed all cases reported in the English language citing myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection., RESULTS: Fourteen records comprising a total of fourteen cases that report myocarditis/myopericarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection were identified. There was a male predominance (58%), with the median age of the cases described being 50.4 years. The majority of patients did not have a previously identified comorbid condition (50%), but of those with a past medical history, hypertension was most prevalent (33%). Electrocardiogram findings were variable, and troponin was elevated in 91% of cases. Echocardiography was performed in 83% of cases reduced function was identified in 60%. Endotracheal intubation was performed in the majority of cases. Glucocorticoids were most commonly used in treatment of myocarditis (58%). Majority of patients survived to discharge (81%) and 85% of those that received steroids survived to discharge., CONCLUSION: Guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established and our knowledge on management is rapidly changing. The use of glucocorticoids and other agents including IL-6 inhibitors, IVIG and colchicine in COVID-19 myocarditis is debatable. In our review, there appears to be favorable outcomes related to myocarditis treated with steroid therapy. However, until larger scale studies are conducted, treatment approaches have to be made on an individualized case-by-case basis. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 in systemic lupus erythematosus: data from a survey on 417 patients. BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease characterised by autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to infections. COVID-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE., OBJECTIVE: to acquire information on the impact of COVID-19 in SLE., METHODS: A 26-item anonymous questionnaire investigating demographics, SLE clinical features, COVID-19 diagnoses and changes in treatments and daily habits was administered to patients with SLE from three referral centres through www.surveymonkey.com over 10 days. Data from the survey were compared to those from published estimates about the general population., RESULTS: Four-hundred-seventeen patients responded to the survey. More than 60% of subjects complained of symptoms that are also associated to COVID-19. Fourteen COVID-19 diagnoses (five confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) were reported, in contrast to a 0.73% prevalence of confirmed cases in Lombardy. One hospitalisation was reported. Fever, anosmia, dry cough, a self-reported history of neuropsychiatric SLE and a recent contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were more strongly associated with COVID-19, as were symptoms and lower compliance to behavioural preventive measures in patients' contacts. No protective effect was seen in subjects on hydroxychloroquine., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 morbidity might only moderately be increased in most patients with SLE, although limited information can be inferred on more severe cases. Hydroxychloroquine apparently seems not to confer protection to infection per se, although other beneficial roles cannot be excluded. Containment policies and behavioural preventive measures could have a major role in limiting the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Enhanced Cellular Transduction of Nanoparticles Resistant to Rapidly Forming Plasma Protein Coronas. Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly being developed as biomedical platforms for drug/nucleic acid delivery and imaging. However, in biological fluids, NPs interact with a wide range of proteins that form a coating known as protein corona. Coronae can critically influence self-interaction and binding of other molecules, which can affect toxicity, promote cell activation, and inhibit general or specific cellular uptake. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding enhanced transduction (GET) is developed to efficiently deliver a variety of cargoes intracellularly; employing GAG-binding peptides, which promote cell targeting, and cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) which enhance endocytotic cell internalization. Herein, it is demonstrated that GET peptide coatings can mediate sustained intracellular transduction of magnetic NPs (MNPs), even in the presence of serum or plasma. NP colloidal stability, physicochemical properties, toxicity and cellular uptake are investigated. Using label-free snapshot proteomics, time-resolved profiles of human plasma coronas formed on functionalized GET-MNPs demonstrate that coronae quickly form (<1 min), with their composition relatively stable but evolving. Importantly GET-MNPs present a subtly different corona composition to MNPs alone, consistent with GAG-binding activities. Understanding how NPs interact with biological systems and can retain enhanced intracellular transduction will facilitate novel drug delivery approaches for cell-type specific targeting of new nanomaterials.

0	Prevalence and correlates of somatization in anxious individuals in a Chinese online crisis intervention during COVID-19 epidemic. BACKGROUND: Somatization is a common comorbidity in anxious people. From January 31 to February 2, 2020, a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety was detected due to COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of somatization among Chinese participants with anxiety receiving online crisis interventions from Feb 14 to Mar 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic., METHODS: A total of 1134 participants who participated in online crisis interventions completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and demographic questions online. Somatization was defined as the average score of each item >= 2 in SCL-90 somatization subscale. Moderate to severe anxiety was defined as a score >= 10 in the GAD-7 scale., RESULTS: Among all participants, 8.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 7.4% reported somatization. After March 1, the prevalence of anxiety with or without somatization did not significantly change (both p > 0.05), while the prevalence of somatization increased significantly (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that somatization was associated with chronic disease history (with an odds ratio of 4.80) and female gender (with an odds ratio of 0.33)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the history of chronic diseases is associated with somatization in individuals with anxiety, indicating some stress-related mechanisms. Chinese men in crisis intervention need more attention because they are more likely to report anxiety comorbid somatization. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Pediatric chest x-ray in covid-19 infection. BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has become pandemic. Pediatric population has been less studied than adult population and prompt diagnosis is challenging due to asymptomatic or mild episodes. Radiology is an important complement to clinical and epidemiological features., OBJECTIVE: To establish the most common CXR patterns in children with COVID-19, evaluate interobserver correlation and to discuss the role of imaging techniques in the management of children., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients between 0 and 16 years of age with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection and CXR were selected. Two paediatric radiologists independently evaluated the images and assessed the type of abnormality, distribution and evolution when available., RESULTS: Median age was 79.8 months (ranging from 2 weeks to 16 years of age). Fever was the most common symptom (43.5 %). 90 % of CXR showed abnormalities. Peribronchial cuffing was the most common finding (86.3 %) followed by GGOs (50 %). In both cases central distribution was more common than peripheral. Consolidations accounted for 18.1 %. Normal CXR, pleural effusion, and altered cardiomediastinal contour were the least common., CONCLUSION: The vast majority of CXR showed abnormalities in children with COVID-19. However, findings are nonspecific. Interobserver correlation was good in describing consolidations, normal x-rays and GGOs. Imaging techniques have a role in the management of children with known or suspected COVID-19, especially in those with moderate or severe symptoms or with underlying risk factors.

0	"Quantitative assessment of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Prospective and retrospective applications. Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively evaluated. The numerous outbreaks that have occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are putting a demand on researchers to develop approaches capable of both predicting contagion in closed environments (predictive assessment) and analyzing previous infections (retrospective assessment). This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The application of a Monte Carlo method allowed the risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable risk of 10-3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time could be well below one hour. Such maximum exposure time clearly depends on the viral load emission of the infected subject and on the exposure conditions; thus, longer exposure times were estimated for mechanically ventilated indoor environments and lower viral load emissions. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we show that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a ""superspreading event"".

0	"The potential impact of enhanced hygienic measures during the COVID-19 outbreak on hospital-acquired infections: A pragmatic study in neurological units. OBJECTIVE: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are frequent complications among acute patients hospitalized in neurological units, especially among those hospitalized for stroke. This study aimed to investigate if enhanced hygienic measures, including the systematic use of personal protective equipment (PPE), determined a decrease in HAI during the recent COVID-19 outbreak in ""COVID-free"" neurological units., METHODS: Patients hospitalized in neurology and stroke units of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital in Rome from March 8, 2020 and discharged prior to May 31, 2020 were included in the study and compared with patients hospitalized during the same period in 2019., RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were included in the study (n = 103 in 2020, n = 216 in 2019). Among patients hospitalized in 2019, the incidence of HAIs was 31.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.38), compared with 23.3% (95% CI: 0.15-0.32) in 2020 (p = 0.12). Multivariable logistic regression showed that hospitalization during 2020 was independently associated with a lower risk of HAIs (odds ratio: 0.34, 95% CI:0.16-0.71, p = 0.004). Poisson regression models showed that hospitalization during 2020 was also independently associated with both a lower number of HAIs (relative risk [RR]: 0.56, 95% CI:0.38-0.81, p = 0.01) and a lower number of prescribed antibiotics per patient (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: Our study design provides evidence regarding the impact of stricter hygienic measures, such as increased PPE use, on HAIs. Larger studies are needed to support the extension of preventive measures even after the COVID-19 outbreak in order to limit the occurrence of HAIs. Copyright © 2020.

0	Impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on health and economics: Focus on developing countries and India. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Presence of comorbidities in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have often been associated with increased in-hospital complications and mortality. Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India., METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19., RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%., CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases. Despite the huge number of COVID-19 patients, India still has low volume research at the moment. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Cardiac arrest and drug-related cardiac toxicity in the Covid-19 era. Epidemiology, pathophysiology and management. SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection has recently become a worldwide challenge with dramatic global economic and health consequences. As the pandemic is still spreading, new data concerning Covid-19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available. Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.

0	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A systematic review. Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, is a new dangerous childhood disease that is temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition., Methods: We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515., Findings: Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 71.0% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (1.7%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 7.9 +/- 0.6 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (73.7%, n = 488), and vomiting (68.3%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal. Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were necessary in 22.2% (n = 147) and 4.4% (n = 29) of patients, respectively. An abnormal echocardiograph was observed in 314 of 581 individuals (54.0%) with depressed ejection fraction (45.1%, n = 262 of 581) comprising the most common aberrancy., Interpretation: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a new pediatric disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is dangerous and potentially lethal. With prompt recognition and medical attention, most children will survive but the long-term outcomes from this condition are presently unknown., Funding: Parker B.

0	SARS-CoV-2 serology and virology trends in donors and recipients of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide. The virus is novel, and currently there is no approved treatment. Convalescent plasma may offer a treatment option. We evaluated trends of IgM/IgG antibodies/plasma viral load in donors and recipients of convalescent plasma. 114/139 (82 %) donors had positive IgG antibodies. 46/114 donors tested positive a second time by NP swab. Among those retested, the median IgG declined (p < 0.01) between tests. 25/139 donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were negative for IgG antibodies. This suggests that having had the infection does not necessarily convey immunity, or there is a short duration of immunity associated with a decline in antibodies. Plasma viral load obtained on 35/39 plasma recipients showed 22 (62.9 %) had non-detectable levels on average 14.5 days from positive test versus 6.2 days in those with detectable levels (p < 0.01). There was a relationship between IgG and viral load. IgG was higher in those with non-detectable viral loads. There was no relationship between viral load and blood type (p = 0.87) or death (0.80). Recipients with detectable viral load had lower IgG levels; there was no relationship between viral load, blood type or death. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Systemic inflammation as fuel for acute liver injury in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: A cytokine storm conceivably contributes to manifestations of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause acute liver injury while serum detectability indicates systemic inflammation., AIMS: We explored a link between systemic IL-6, related acute phase proteins and liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients., METHODS: 655 patients with suspected COVID-19 were screened in the emergency department at the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria, between February and April 2020. 96 patients (~15%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. 15 patients required intensive-care treatment (ICT). Plasma aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transferase, as well as IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined by standard clinical assays., RESULTS: Of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 41 (42%) showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration. COVID-19 patients with elevated AST exhibited significantly higher IL-6 (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001), LDH (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.05) serum concentrations compared to patients with normal AST. Liver injury correlated with systemic IL-6 (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001) and LDH (p < 0.001) concentration. In COVID-19 patients requiring ICT, correlations were more pronounced., CONCLUSION: Systemic inflammation could be a fuel for hepatic injury in COVID-19.

0	Assessing the effect of containment measures on the spatio-temporal dynamic of COVID-19 in Italy. This paper aims at investigating empirically whether and to what extent the containment measures adopted in Italy had an impact in reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease across provinces. For this purpose, we extend the multivariate time-series model for infection counts proposed in Paul and Held (Stat Med 30(10):118-1136, 2011) by augmenting the model specification with B-spline regressors in order to account for complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics in the propagation of the disease. The results of the model estimated on the time series of the number of infections for the Italian provinces show that the containment measures, despite being globally effective in reducing both the spread of contagion and its self-sustaining dynamics, have had nonlinear impacts across provinces. The impact has been relatively stronger in the northern local areas, where the disease occurred earlier and with a greater incidence. This evidence may be explained by the shared popular belief that the contagion was not a close-to-home problem but rather restricted to a few distant northern areas, which, in turn, might have led individuals to adhere less strictly to containment measures and lockdown rules.

0	Risk Factors for SARS-CoV2 Infection in Pregnant Women. Background: Risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy remain poorly understood. Understanding populations at heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts., Objective: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without SARS-CoV2 infection and, among those with SARS-CoV2, to compare characteristics of those who reported COVID-19 symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis., Study Design: This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020 - May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Among women who tested positive, women were further dichotomized by whether they endorsed symptoms of COVID-19. Bivariable analysis, and non-parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders as well as to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors., Results: During the study period, 1,418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Of the 101 women who tested positive, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV2, women who tested positive were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as Black/African-American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, have pre-existing pulmonary disease, and have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic., Conclusion: Many risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population. The observed association between SARS-CoV2 infection and having children raises the possibility of children themselves as vectors of viral spread or behavior patterns of parents as mediators of acquisition.

0	Unexpected finding of myocardial depression in 2 healthy young patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: possible support for COVID-19-related myocarditis. COVID-19 is proving to be a devastating pandemic with both tragic economic and health consequences worldwide. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs has been thrust into the forefront of resources that could be used in the management of COVID-19 acute care patients. However, relatively little attention has been paid to POCUS utility in assessing the heart in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal reports suggest encounters of likely COVID-19 induced pericardial effusions and myocardial electrical dysfunction. This article presents 2 cases of generally healthy patients who were noted to have classic COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia findings on lung ultrasound and incidentally discovered to have unsuspected left ventricular dysfunction likely resulting from myocarditis. POCUS videos are presented as illustrations of this potentially overlooked complication. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Screening for economic hardship for child welfare-involved families during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid partnership response. BACKGROUND: Pandemics have a wide range of economic, health and social consequences related to both the spread of a disease and efforts made by government leaders to contain it which may be particularly detrimental for the child welfare-involved population. This is because child welfare agencies serve some of the highest needs children and families. A significant proportion of these families face economic hardship, and as a result of containment measures for COVID-19, more families inevitably will., OBJECTIVE: Given the range of negative consequences related to the pandemic and the evolving supports available to families, child protection workers needed a clinical tool to guide and support work with families informed by an understanding of economic hardship. The objective of this paper is to report on the development and implementation strategy of a tool to be used for practice intervention during the pandemic., METHODS: Action research methodology was utilized in the creation of the clinical tool. The tool's development and implementation occurred through an academic/child welfare sector partnership involving child welfare agencies representing diverse regions and populations in Ontario, Canada. Factor analysis of representative child welfare data from the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2018 (OIS-2018) on economic hardship was used to inform the development of questions on the clinical tool., RESULTS: The development and implementation strategy of the clinical tool are described, including the results from analyses of the OIS-2018., CONCLUSIONS: Future directions for the project are discussed, including considerations for using this tool beyond the pandemic.

0	Clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and maternal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospitalized pregnant women: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women represent a potentially high-risk population in the COVID-19 pandemic., OBJECTIVE: To summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes among pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19., SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant databases were searched up until May 29, 2020., SELECTION CRITERIA: Case series/reports of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Methodologic quality was assessed via NIH assessment tools., MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 63 observational studies of 637 women (84.6% in third trimester) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Most (76.5%) women experienced mild disease. Maternal fatality, stillbirth, and neonatal fatality rates were 1.6%, 1.4%, and 1.0%, respectively. Older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and raised serum D-dimer and interleukin-6 were predictive of poor outcomes. Overall, 33.7% of live births were preterm, of which half were iatrogenic among women with mild COVID-19 and no complications. Most women underwent cesarean despite lacking a clear indication. Eight (2.0%) neonates had positive nasopharyngeal swabs after delivery and developed chest infection within 48 hours., CONCLUSIONS: Advanced gestation, maternal age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and a combination of elevated D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels are predictive of poor pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19. The rate of iatrogenic preterm birth and cesarean delivery is high; vertical transmission may be possible but has not been proved. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The epidemiological burden and overall distribution of chronic comorbidities in coronavirus disease-2019 among 202,005 infected patients: evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis. PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to examine the overall distribution of chronic comorbidities in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infected populations and the risk of the underlying burden of disease in terms of the case fatality ratio (CFR)., METHODS: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on COVID-19 patients published before 10th April 2020. Twenty-three studies containing data for 202,005 COVID-19 patients were identified and included in our study. Pooled effects of chronic comorbid conditions and CFR with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models., RESULTS: A median age of COVID-19 patients was 56.4 years and 55% of the patients were male. The most prevalent chronic comorbid conditions were: any type of chronic comorbidity (37%; 95% CI 32-41%), hypertension (22%; 95% CI 17-27%), diabetes (14%; 95% CI 12-17%), respiratory diseases (5%; 95% CI 3-6%), cardiovascular diseases (13%; 95% CI 10-16%) and other chronic diseases (e.g., cancer) (8%; 95% CI 6-10%). Furthermore, 37% of COVID-19 patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition, 28% of patients had two conditions, and 19% of patients had three or more chronic conditions. The overall pooled CFR was 7% (95% CI 6-7%). The crude CFRs increased significantly with increasing number of chronic comorbid conditions, ranging from 6% for at least one chronic comorbid condition to 13% for 2 or 3 chronic comorbid conditions, 12% for 4 chronic comorbid conditions, 14% for 5 chronic comorbid conditions, and 21% for 6 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Furthermore, the overall CFRs also significantly increased with higher levels of reported clinical symptoms, ranging from 14% for at least four symptoms, to 15% for 5 or 6 symptoms, and 21% for 7 or more symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: The chronic comorbid conditions were identified as dominating risk factors, which should be considered in an emergency disease management and treatment choices. There is urgent need to further enhance systematic and real-time sharing of epidemiologic data, clinical results, and experience to inform the global response to COVID-19.	false
0	Compassionate use of JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for severe COVID-19: a prospective observational study. Overwhelming inflammatory reactions contribute to respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We report on a prospective, observational study in 34 patients with COVID-19 who received ruxolitinib on a compassionate-use protocol. Patients had severe pulmonary disease defined by pulmonary infiltrates on imaging and an oxygen saturation <= 93% in air and/or PaO2/FiO2 ratio <= 300 mmHg. Median age was 80.5 years, and 85.3% had >= 2 comorbidities. Median exposure time to ruxolitinib was 13 days, median dose intensity was 20 mg/day. Overall survival by day 28 was 94.1%. Cumulative incidence of clinical improvement of >=2 points in the ordinal scale was 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 71-93). Clinical improvement was not affected by low-flow versus high-flow oxygen support but was less frequent in patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg. The most frequent adverse events were anemia, urinary tract infections, and thrombocytopenia. Improvement of inflammatory cytokine profile and activated lymphocyte subsets was observed at day 14. In this prospective cohort of aged and high-risk comorbidity patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use ruxolitinib was safe and was associated with improvement of pulmonary function and discharge home in 85.3%. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish efficacy of ruxolitinib in COVID-19.	false
0	"Swabbing Thoroughly People for COVID-19 Positivity. Insights on the Main Bio-analytical and Microbiology Bias and Concerns. Thorough swabbing is becoming an increasing approach to fight COVID-19 transmission, particularly among asymptomatic subjects, who are thought to represent the majority of potentially-contacting people. Particularly in the current management of COVID-19 emergency, the 3T approach, i.e., testing, tracing and treating, is felt as particularly crucial to fight COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from the time-consuming, cost expensive and the many burdensome issues associated with a thorough swabbing, adopting easy-to-make criteria such as ""drive-thru-swab"" may exacerbate the burden of critical biases and pre-analytical errors, which may impair the analytical reliability of these tests. This manuscript addresses some major points about."	false
0	Care of the COVID-19 exposed complex newborn infant. As we confront COVID-19, the global public health emergency of our times, new knowledge is emerging that, combined with information from prior epidemics, can provide insights on how to manage this threat in specific patient populations. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses, caused serious respiratory illness in pregnant women that resulted in adverse perinatal outcomes. Thus far, COVID-19 appears to follow a mild course in the vast majority of pregnant women. A significant proportion of pregnant women appear to be asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is limited information on how COVID-19 impacts the fetus and whether vertical transmission occurs. While these knowledge gaps are addressed, it is important to recognize the highly efficient transmission characteristics of SARS-C0V-2 and its potential for causing serious disease in vulnerable individuals, including health care workers. This review provides perspectives from a single center in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic within the United States. It offers an overview of the preparations required for deliveries of newborns of mothers with COVID-19 and the management of neonates with particular emphasis on those born with complex issues.

0	Spatial prediction of COVID-19 epidemic using ARIMA techniques in India. The latest Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become an infectious disease that causes millions of people to infect. Effective short-term prediction models are designed to estimate the number of possible events. The data obtained from 30th January to 26 April, 2020 and from 27th April 2020 to 11th May 2020 as modelling and forecasting samples, respectively. Spatial distribution of disease risk analysis is carried out using weighted overlay analysis in GIS platform. The epidemiologic pattern in the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019 is forecasted with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We assessed cumulative confirmation cases COVID-19 in Indian states with a high daily incidence in the task of time-series forecasting. Such efficiency metrics such as an index of increasing results, mean absolute error (MAE), and a root mean square error (RMSE) are the out-of-samples for the prediction precision of model. Results shows west and south of Indian district are highly vulnerable for COVID-2019. The accuracy of ARIMA models in forecasting future epidemic of COVID-2019 proved the effectiveness in epidemiological surveillance. For more in-depth studies, our analysis may serve as a guide for understanding risk attitudes and social media interactions across countries. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in hematologic patients affected By COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are considered highly vulnerable to the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there are still few data on COVID-19 occurring in hematologic patients., METHODS: One hundred two patients with COVID-19 symptoms and a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seen at 2 hematologic departments located in Lombardy, Italy, during March 2020 were studied. Risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were analyzed by comparisons of patients with COVID-19 and the standard hematologic population managed at the same institutions in 2019. Thirty-day survival was compared with the survival of matched uninfected control patients with similar hematologic disorders and nonhematologic patients affected by COVID-19., RESULTS: Male sex was significantly more prevalent in patients with COVID-19. The infection occurred across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring a COVID-19 infection was lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive-related treatments. The 30-day mortality rate was 39.2%, which was higher than the rates for nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) and uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001). The severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and active hematologic treatment were independently associated with a worse prognosis. Neither diagnosis nor disease status affected the prognosis. The worst prognosis was demonstrated among patients on active hematologic treatment and those with more severe respiratory syndrome at COVID-19 presentation., CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients should be advised to seek medical attention at the earliest signs of dyspnea and/or respiratory infection. Physicians should perform a risk-benefit analysis to determine the impact of temporarily deferring nonlifesaving treatments versus the risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19., LAY SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurs across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring it is lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive treatment. The 30-day mortality rate is 39.2%, which is far higher than the rates for both uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001) and nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) despite matching for age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of disease. Variables independently associated with a worse prognosis are the severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and any type of active hematologic treatment. Neither diagnosis nor disease status influence the prognosis. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.	false
0	Caregiver and service provider vaccine confidence following the Changchun Changsheng vaccine incident in China: A cross-sectional mixed methods study. INTRODUCTION: The Changchun Changsheng Vaccine Incident (CCVI) occurred mid-2018 and involved irregularities in the manufacture and quality control of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis and rabies vaccines. This study investigates vaccine confidence amongst Chinese caregivers and vaccination-service providers (VSPs) six months after the CCVI., METHODS: Quantitative surveys were conducted in January 2019 with 2124 caregivers of children and 555 VSPs in three areas in China. The proportions of respondents who agreed to the four statements from the Vaccine Confidence Index TM were used to measure vaccine confidence. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed to study the level of vaccine confidence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 caregivers, 43 VSPs and 9 immunization program managers. Interviews were analyzed thematically using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. Media surveillance was conducted to monitor public responses to the CCVI., RESULTS: Media surveillance indicated that public attention to vaccine-related issues increased sharply immediately post-CCVI but declined rapidly thereafter. Six months post-CCVI, 96.0% of caregivers and the same proportion of VSPs reported that vaccination was important and compatible with their religious beliefs. 82.7% and 88.2% of caregivers agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. 92.8% and 94.6% of VSPs agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. Both caregivers and VSPs reported an immediate decline in vaccine confidence post-CCVI. In most cases this trust was regained over time following government and public health responses, however some people remained hesitant about vaccinating their children. Many VSPs were overwhelmed by consultations, workload and psychological pressure after the CCVI., CONCLUSION: After an initial decline, vaccine confidence recovered to pre-incident levels six months after the CCVI. However, some caregivers moved from the higher to the lower end of the vaccine confidence spectrum, pointing to the need to promote the acceptance of vaccination especially given the need for new vaccines to control the coronavirus epidemic.

0	Impact of Shenfu injection on a composite of organ dysfunction development in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Objectives: This study aims to determine the protection provided by Shenfu injection (a traditional Chinese medicine) against development of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Trial design: This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, two-arm ratio 1:1, parallel group clinical trial. Participant(s): The patients, who are aged from 18 to 75 years old, with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of severe or critical COVID-19, will be consecutively recruited in the study, according to the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (the 7th version) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Exclusion criteria include pregnant and breastfeeding women, atopy or allergies to Shenfu Injection (SFI), severe underlying disease (malignant tumor with multiple metastases, uncontrolled hemopathy, cachexia, severe malnutrition, HIV), active bleeding, obstructive pneumonia caused by lung tumor, severe pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, alveolar proteinosis and allergic alveolitis, continuous use of immunosuppressive drugs in last 6 months, organ transplantation, expected death within 48 hours, the patients considered unsuitable for this study by researchers. The study is conducted in 11 ICUs of designated hospitals for COVID-19, located in 5 cities of China. Intervention and comparator: The enrolled patients will randomly receive 100 ml SFI (study group) or identical volume of saline (control group) twice a day for seven consecutive days. Patients in the both groups will be given usual care and the necessary supportive therapies as recommended by the latest edition of the management guidelines for COVID-19 (the 7th version so far). Main outcomes: The primary endpoint is a composite of newly developed or exacerbated organ dysfunction. This is defined as an increase in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or more, indicating sepsis and involvement of at least one organ. The SOFA score will be measured for the 14 days after enrolment from the baseline (the score at randomization). The secondary endpoints are shown below: *SOFA score in total *Pneumonia severity index score *Dosage of vasoactive drugs *Ventilation free days within 28 days *Length of stay in intensive care unit *Total hospital costs to treat the patient *28-day mortality *The incidence of adverse drug events related to SFI Randomisation: The block randomization codes were generated by SAS V.9.1 for allocation of participants in this study.

0	Management of haemophilia patients in the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience in Wuhan and Tianjin, two differently affected cities in China. OBJECTIVE: To identify lessons learned from haemophilia care experience in Wuhan (COVID-19 outbreak epicenter in China) and Tianjin (with relatively low COVID-19 incidence) in the pandemic., METHODS: We compared the challenges in haemophilia management attributed to local COVID-19 containment policies, healthcare resource availability, clotting factors supply, daily living restrictions and coping strategies employed., RESULTS: Wuhan was in lockdown with strict traffic controls, enforced quarantine and overwhelmed resources. Tianjin was in relatively relaxed countermeasures to COVID-19. In Wuhan, haemophilia treatment (for bleeding, prophylaxis, multidisciplinary team care, immune tolerance induction) and patient education were severely affected, while the challenges in Tianjin were less. In both cities, patients' fear for COVID-19 infection also affected their management. Coping strategy in Wuhan included channelling of clotting factors supply from hospitals to nine pharmacies; timely transfers of in-need patients to healthcare facilities by a volunteer service network jointly coordinated by the government, hospitals and the community. Although factor concentrate supply in each city was adequate, patients still worried whether there would be enough supply to last through the pandemics. Consequently, many downgraded their treatment regimens resulting in increased bleeding episodes. In both cities, telemedicine was promoted for patient care and education., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had varying adverse impacts on haemophilia care depending on the local infection incidence. Our experience suggests that haemophilia management strategies in the pandemic need to be established according to the local virus containment/mitigation policies, daily living restrictions and resource availability.

0	"Considerations for target oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients: are we under-shooting?. BACKGROUND: The current target oxygen saturation range for patients with COVID-19 recommended by the National Institutes of Health is 92-96%., MAIN BODY: This article critically examines the evidence guiding current target oxygen saturation recommendation for COVID-19 patients, and raises important concerns in the extrapolation of data from the two studies stated to be guiding the recommendation. Next, it examines the influence of hypoxia on upregulation of ACE2 (target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry) expression, with supporting transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available gene expression profile dataset of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Finally, it discusses potential implications of specific clinical observations and considerations in COVID-19 patients on target oxygen saturation, such as diffuse systemic endothelitis and microthrombi playing an important pathogenic role in the wide range of systemic manifestations, exacerbation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the setting of pulmonary vascular endothelitis/microthrombi, the phenomenon of ""silent hypoxemia"" with some patients presenting to the hospital with severe hypoxemia disproportional to symptoms, and overburdened health systems and public health resources in many parts of the world with adverse implications on outpatient monitoring and early institution of oxygen supplementation., CONCLUSIONS: The above factors and analyses, put together, call for an urgent exploration and re-evaluation of target oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients, both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Until data from such trials become available, where possible, it may be prudent to target an oxygen saturation at least at the upper end of the recommended 92-96% range in COVID-19 patients both in the inpatient and outpatient settings (in patients that are normoxemic at pre-COVID baseline). Home pulse oximetry, tele-monitoring, and earlier institution of oxygen supplementation for hypoxemic COVID-19 outpatients could be beneficial, where public health resources allow for their implementation."	false
0	Diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus blocks: a focused review of current evidence and their role during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Given that COVID-19 can severely impair lung function, regional anesthesia techniques avoiding phrenic nerve paralysis are relevant in the anesthetic management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients requiring shoulder and clavicle surgical procedures. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of recently published studies examining ultrasound-guided diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques for the brachial plexus (BP) to favor their preferent use in patients at risk of respiratory function compromise., RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 18 months, study findings on various diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques have demonstrated comparable block analgesic effectivity with a variable extent of phrenic nerve paralysis. The impact of hemi-diaphragmatic function impairment on clinical outcomes is yet to be established., SUMMARY: Existing diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus regional anesthesia techniques used for shoulder and clavicle surgery may help minimize pulmonary complications by preserving lung function, especially in patients prone to respiratory compromise. Used as an anesthetic technique, they can reduce the risk of exposure of healthcare teams to aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs), albeit posing an increased risk for hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and obtaining opioid-sparing analgesia without jeopardizing efficacy should be prioritized goals of regional anesthesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Predicting Disease Severity and Outcome in COVID-19 Patients: A Review of Multiple Biomarkers. CONTEXT: An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on COVID-19, but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed. OBJECTIVE(S): To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed including 54 peer reviewed papers and 18 non-peer reviewed preprints. CONCLUSION(S): While non-specific, acute phase reactants including CRP, ferritin, SAA, and procalcitonin were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated WBC count, marked lymphopenia, decreased CD3, CD4 or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts, high neutrophil count, thrombocytopenia, and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated IL-6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index or COVID-19 Severity Score may be utilized to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited due to study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.Copyright © 2020 College of American Pathologists.	false
0	"Nicotinic Cholinergic System and COVID-19: In Silico Identification of an Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Nicotinic Receptors with Potential Therapeutic Targeting Implications. While SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cell entry, it is important to examine other potential interactions between the virus and other cell receptors. Based on the clinical observation of low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we examined and identified a ""toxin-like"" amino acid (aa) sequence in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375-390), which is homologous to a sequence of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1, one of the many snake venom toxins that are known to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We present the 3D structural location of this ""toxin-like"" sequence on the Spike Glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. We also performed computational molecular modelling and docking experiments using 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the extracellular domain of the nAChR alpha9 subunit. We identified a main interaction between the aa 381-386 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the aa 189-192 of the extracellular domain of the nAChR alpha9 subunit, a region which forms the core of the ""toxin-binding site"" of the nAChRs. The mode of interaction is very similar to the interaction between the alpha9 nAChR and alpha-bungarotoxin. A similar interaction was observed between the pentameric alpha7 AChR chimera and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with nAChRs, supporting the hypothesis of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system being implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Nicotine and other nicotinic cholinergic agonists may protect nAChRs and thus have therapeutic value in COVID-19 patients."	false
0	SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and advances in developing potential therapeutics and vaccines to counter this emerging pandemic. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), causing an emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which has taken a catastrophic turn with high toll rates in China and subsequently spreading across the globe. The rapid spread of this virus to more than 210 countries while affecting more than 25 million people and causing more than 843,000 human deaths, it has resulted in a pandemic situation in the world. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, all of which originated in bats. It is highly contagious, causing symptoms like fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, and the severely infected patients succumb to the disease. Coronaviruses (CoVs) among all known RNA viruses have the largest genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the molecular basis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and evolution, develop effective therapeutics, antiviral drugs, and vaccines, and to design rapid and confirmatory viral diagnostics as well as adopt appropriate prevention and control strategies. To date, August 30, 2020, no effective, proven therapeutic antibodies or specific drugs, and vaccines have turned up. In this review article, we describe the underlying molecular organization and phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and recent advances in diagnosis and vaccine development in brief and focusing mainly on developing potential therapeutic options that can be explored to manage this pandemic virus infection, which would help in valid countering of COVID-19.	false
0	Intersectionality and inequalities in medical risk for severe COVID-19 in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older populations with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality once infected. Intersectional gerontology considers the compounding effects of multiple forms of social inequity. This study explores how racial-nativity status, family income, education level and the intersecting profile of these three social standings stratify differential patterns of chronic conditions among Canadians aged 45 years and older., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 29,748), multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds of having one and/or two (<= 2) or multiple (>=3) medical conditions (i.e., diabetes, asthma, cancer, previous heart attack, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity) based on socio-demographic characteristics., RESULTS: There were significant racial-nativity disparities and social-class gradients in multimorbidity. The odds of having >=3 medical conditions were greater for Black immigrants (OR=1.79, 95% CI=1.13, 2.82), South Asian immigrants (OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.02, 2.19) and close to double for Aboriginal Canadians (OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.37, 2.80) relative to Canadian-born Whites. Black, South Asian and Aboriginal populations from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds had the highest odds of having >=3 medical conditions (OR=3.50, 95% CI=1.41, 8.70)., DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Despite a universal health system, marginalized older Canadians who are racialized foreign-born, less educated, and/or low-income have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity that are associated with COVID-19 severe illness and mortality. Upstream health policy and social care tackling intersecting structural inequities should be undertaken to prevent increasing multimorbidity among underserved aging populations.

0	A child infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presenting with diarrhea without fever and cough: A case report. RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), now a global pandemic, has spread to a large number of countries around the world. Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Some cases even remain asymptomatic. Data regarding the epidemiological and clinical features of children with COVID-19 are limited. Symptoms in children are thought to be atypical when compared with adults. As a result, diagnosis in many children is likely to be missed. Children presenting with atypical symptoms, especially those with a history of exposure, should be referred to early screening., PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-month-old boy presented with a 2-day history of diarrhea. Chest computed tomography scan showed pneumonia. After admission to the hospital, the patient exhibited no diarrhea or other symptoms. Positive presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, was confirmed by 5 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was also found to have liver damage., DIAGNOSIS: Swabs were obtained for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by established methods., INTERVENTIONS: Chinese traditional medicine prescription OUTCOMES:: Following treatment, signs of pneumonia on computed tomography scans were observed to be partially absorbed, and 2 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing of swab samples were negative. The patient was discharged on the 21st day after admission to the hospital. On the 21st day after discharge, the patient had no recurrence of disease, no recurrence of pulmonary lesions, and normal liver function., CONCLUSION: This case study suggests that diarrhea not explained by common causes, such as acute gastroenteritis, could be a preliminary symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Despite the lack of the presence of a fever or cough, lung pulmonary lesions were present in this child. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cause hepatic injury. Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovery period, IgM and IgG antibodies can be positive for a long time.	false
0	Anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China. Fangcang shelter hospitals were established in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a countermeasure to stop the spread of the disease. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having >= two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having >= two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk.	false
0	Combating COVID-19: MVA Vector Vaccines Applied to the Respiratory Tract as Promising Approach Toward Protective Immunity in the Lung. The lung is the vital target organ of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the majority of patients the most active virus replication seems to be found in the upper respiratory tract, severe cases however suffer from SARS-like disease associated with virus replication in lung tissues. Due to the current lack of suitable anti-viral drugs the induction of protective immunity such as neutralizing antibodies in the lung is the key aim of the only alternative approach-the development and application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, past experience from experimental animals, livestock, and humans showed that induction of immunity in the lung is limited following application of vaccines at peripheral sides such as skin or muscles. Based on several considerations we therefore propose here to consider the application of a Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine to mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract as a favorable approach to combat COVID-19.

0	Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 by droplet digital PCR in real-time PCR negative nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected COVID-19 patients. Since SARS-CoV-2-based disease (COVID-19) spreads as a pandemic, the necessity of a highly sensitive molecular diagnosis that can drastically reduce false negatives reverse transcription PCR (rtPCR) results, raises as a major clinical need. Here we evaluated the performance of a ddPCR-based assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 titer in 55 suspected COVID-19 cases with negative rtPCR results thanks to in-house ddPCR assay (targeting RdRp and host RNaseP). Samples were collected at ASST-GOM Niguarda between February and May 2020 at hospital admission. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging and definition of disease severity. Patients were mainly female (45.5%) with a median age of 73 (57-84) years. ddPCR-based assay detected SARS-CoV-2 genome in nasopharyngeal samples of 19 (34.5%) patients (median viral-load: 128 copies/mL, IQR: 72-345). In 15 of them (78.9%), chest CT showed a classical COVID-19 bilateral interstitial pneumonia; 14 patients (73.7%) showed severe COVID-19 manifestations. ddPCR did not identify any trace of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the respiratory samples of the remaining 36 patients. The serological assay performed in a subgroup of 34 patients at the later stage of illness (from 3 days to 90 days after) confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in ddPCR (100%). Contrariwise, negative tests were observed in 95.0% ddPCR negative patients (P<0.001). Thanks to a ddPCR-based assay, we achieved a rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in rtPCR-negative respiratory samples of individuals with COVID-19 suspect, allowing the rapid taking care and correct management of these patients.	false
0	Disease Prevention Knowledge, Anxiety, and Professional Identity during COVID-19 Pandemic in Nursing Students in Zhengzhou, China. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate nursing students' understanding of the prevention of COVID-19, as well as their anxiety towards the disease and their perception of their professional identity in the wake of the pandemic, in Zhengzhou, China., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate 474 nursing students by cluster sampling using a stratified questionnaire from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors affecting professional identity. Binary and multiple logistic regression were used to identify the factors affecting anxiety., RESULTS: Responders with a high level of understanding of COVID-19 and frequent use of behavioral strategies for its prevention comprised 93.2% and 30.0% of the cohort, respectively. Professional identity was significantly associated with gender and anxiety (p < .050). The prevalence of anxiety among nursing students was 12.4%. Male (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26~4.52), sophomores (OR = 5.30; 95% CI = 1.61~7.45), and infrequent use of prevention measures (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.16~5.19) had a significant effect on anxiety., CONCLUSION: Anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic gives an adverse effect on the professional identity of nursing in students. Nursing education institutions need to provide psychological counseling services for nursing students, in addition to improving their teaching of COVID-19 prevention strategies.

0	Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir compared with standard of care in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with moderate or severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19): a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Currently no effective antiviral therapy has been found to treat COVID-19. The aim of this trial was to assess if the addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir improved clinical outcomes in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. METHOD(S): This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical trial in adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 admitted to four university hospitals in Iran. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus standard care, or a control arm receiving standard care alone. The primary endpoint was clinical recovery within 14days of treatment. The study is registered with IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200128046294N2. RESULT(S): Between 26 March and 26 April 2020, 66 patients were recruited and allocated to either the treatment arm (n=33) or the control arm (n=33). Clinical recovery within 14days was achieved by 29/33 (88%) in the treatment arm and 22/33 (67%) in the control arm (P=0.076). The treatment arm had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization [6days (IQR 4-8)] than the control group [8days (IQR 5-13)]; P=0.029. Cumulative incidence of hospital discharge was significantly higher in the treatment arm versus the control (Gray's P=0.041). Three patients died in the treatment arm and five in the control arm. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION(S): The addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir to standard care significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay compared with standard care alone. Although fewer deaths were observed in the treatment arm, this was not statistically significant. Conducting larger scale trials seems prudent.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 has been reported in the pediatric population; however, there is limited information in Latin American and the Caribbean countries., Objectives: To describe the frequency of cases, deaths, incidence, and case fatality rate attributed to COVID-19 in children and adolescents from Latin American and the Caribbean countries., Methods: An observational study was carried-out using COVID-19 case registries in children and adolescents published by the Ministries of Health of 19 countries in Latin American and the Caribbean countries until May 20, 2020. Cases and deaths were classified by sex and age group. Also, incidence and case fatality rates were calculated for each country., Results: A total of 20,757 (4.2% of all patients) cases of COVID-19 were reported in children from 0 to 19 years of age. 52.4% was in the group aged 10 to 19 years. 50.6% were male. 139 (0.26%) deaths were reported in children from 0 to 19 years. The accumulated incidence was higher in Chile, Panama, and Peru. The cumulative incidence per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 1.26 to 77.55 in the population from 0 to 9 years old, 1.57 to 98.84 from 10 to 19 years old, and 0.91 to 88.34 from 0 to 19 years old. The case fatality rate in children from 0 to 19 years old ranged from 0 to 9.09%., Conclusion: In 19 Latin American and the Caribbean countries, the frequency of cases, cumulative incidence, case fatality rate in children and adolescents was heterogeneous. These results contribute to understanding the epidemiological behavior of this disease in children and adolescents of the countries included in the study.	false
0	COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Patient Knowledge and Perceptions in a Single Center Survey. Background and objectives: Spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection from China to countries with a higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has generated concern among gastroenterologists and patients. The aim of this survey is to evaluate knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, disease management, prevention measures, and anxiety level during pandemic among patients with IBD. Material and methods: From 15th March to 15th April 2020, a questionnaire survey was administered to 200 patients with IBD by email or phone application. The questionnaire consisted of five sections: (1) anthropometric, demographic and clinical characteristics, (2) knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, (3) IBD management, (4) prevention measures, (5) anxiety level during pandemic. Results: One hundred forty two questionnaires were completed. Ninety-seven patients (68.3%) were males with a mean age of 46 years (SD 13; range 17-76). Fifty-four individuals (38%) were affected by Crohn disease and 88 (62%) by Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients reported high knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (80%), IBD management (72%), and prevention measures (97%). Sixty-two percent of them showed moderate-high level of anxiety. High education level was independently associated with high knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-16.6, p = 0.009) and older age (OR 1, 95%, CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.01), while the receipt of e-format educational material with low knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (OR 3, 95%, CI 1.08-9.3, p = 0.03). Displaying an active disease appeared to be independently associated with low knowledge of IBD management (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.4-22.8, p = 0.01) and no variables other than an older age was independently associated with higher level of anxiety (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.009-1.09, p = 0.01). Conclusions: High educational level and aging promote knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, while e-format educational material does not. Taken together with findings that an active disease status compromises knowledge of IBD management and the high level of anxiety related to increasing age, these data suggest the need of further supporting patient-oriented strategies in IBD during Covid-19 pandemic.	false

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the globe with unprecedented consequences for the health of millions of people. While the pandemic is still in progress, with new incidents being reported every day, the resilience of the global society is constantly being challenged. Under these circumstances, the future seems uncertain. SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread panic among civilians and insecurity at all socio-political and economic levels, dramatically disrupting everyday life, global economy, international travel and trade. The disease has also been linked to the onset of depression in many individuals due to the extreme restriction measures that have been taken for the prevention of the rapid spreading of COVID-19. First, the socio-economic, political and psychological implications of the COVID-19 pandemic were explored. Substantial evidence is provided for the consequences of the pandemic on all aspects of everyday life, while at the same time we unravel the role and the pursuits of national regimes during this unforeseen situation. The second goal of this review is related to the scientific aspect of the pandemic. Hence, we explain why SARS-CoV-2 is not a so-called 'invisible enemy', and also attempt to give insight regarding the origin of the virus, in an effort to reject the conspiracy theories that have arisen during the pandemic. Finally, rational strategies were investigated for successful vaccine development. We are optimistic that this review will complement the knowledge of specialized scientists and inform non-specialized readers on basic scientific questions, and also on the social and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Entry Inhibitors: Efficient Means to Block Viral Infection. The emerging and re-emerging viral infections are constant threats to human health and wellbeing. Several strategies have been explored to develop vaccines against these viral diseases. The main effort in the journey of development of vaccines is to neutralize the fusion protein using antibodies. However, significant efforts have been made in discovering peptides and small molecules that inhibit the fusion between virus and host cell, thereby inhibiting the entry of viruses. This class of inhibitors is called entry inhibitors, and they are extremely efficient in reducing viral infection as the entry of the virus is considered as the first step of infection. Nevertheless, these inhibitors are highly selective for a particular virus as antibody-based vaccines. The recent COVID-19 pandemic lets us ponder to shift our attention towards broad-spectrum antiviral agents from the so-called 'one bug-one drug' approach. This review discusses peptide and small molecule-based entry inhibitors against class I, II, and III viruses and sheds light on broad-spectrum antiviral agents.	false
0	An Impaired Natriuretic Peptide Hormone System May Play a Role in COVID-19 Severity in Vulnerable Populations. Advanced age, underlying cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), and obesity are associated with a higher risk of progression to severe hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death in COVID-19-infected patients. African Americans have a higher degree of COVID-19 mortality. The incidence of salt-sensitive hypertension is higher in older individuals and African Americans. Lower circulating levels of natriuretic peptides, key regulators of vascular tone and kidney function, have been associated with salt-sensitive hypertension and obesity. Evidence has accumulated that ANP administered to pulmonary endothelial cells, isolated lungs, and patients suffering from ARDS reduces endothelial damage and preserves the endothelial barrier, thereby reducing pulmonary edema and inflammation. Epidemiologic and pharmacologic data suggest that deficiencies in the natriuretic peptide hormone system may contribute to the development of severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients, and treatments that augment natriuretic peptide signaling may have potential to limit progression to ARDS.

0	Mild or no COVID-19 symptoms in cladribine-treated multiple sclerosis: Two cases and implications for clinical practice. BACKGROUND: The use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) could affect COVID-19 outcomes by modulating the immune response, which, in turn, might favor viral replication and/or confer protection from COVID-19 induced inflammatory response CASE REPORT: We report on two MS patients treated with cladribine, with heterogeneous demographics and clinical features, who developed mild or no symptoms from COVID-19 and produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, notwithstanding low lymphocyte levels., IMPLICATIONS: Benign COVID-19 clinical course and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production can occur in MS patients with lymphopenia, suggesting the possibility to respond to COVID-19 vaccination, once available, in this vulnerable population.

The first identification of autochthonous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy was documented by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies of L. Sacco Hospital (Milano, Italy) on 20th February 2020 in a 38 years old male patient, who was found positive for pneumonia at the Codogno Hospital. Thereafter Lombardy has reported the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially in Milano, Brescia and Bergamo provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the potential presence of different viral clusters belonging to the six main provinces involved in Lombardy COVID-19 cases in order to highlight peculiar province-dependent viral characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 20 full length genomes obtained from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020, aligned with 41 Italian viral genome assemblies available on GISAID database as of 30th March, 2020: two main monophyletic clades, containing 8 and 53 isolates, respectively, were identified. Noteworthy, Bergamo isolates mapped inside the small clade harbouring M gene D3G mutation. The molecular clock analysis estimated a cluster divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains had spread worldwide at different times, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, this epidemiological reconstruction suggests that virus initial circulation in Lombardy was ascribable to multiple introduction. The phylogenetic reconstruction robustness, however, will be improved when more genomic sequences are available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.

0	Could masks curtail the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19 in the US?. The community lockdown measures implemented in the United States from late March to late May of 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in the community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods (mention what happens if lockdown measures were extended by two weeks). We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.Copyright © 2020.

0	Comparative tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with implications for clinical manifestations, transmissibility, and laboratory studies of COVID-19: an observational study. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from China in January, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus-host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown., Methods: We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA., Findings: SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0.52). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0.0098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0.036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0.016; FRhK4, p=0.0004)., Interpretation: As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV., Funding: May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Richard Yu and Carol Yu, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund, Chan Yin Chuen Memorial Charitable Foundation, Marina Man-Wai Lee, The Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, The Jessie & George Ho Charitable Foundation, Perfect Shape Medical, The Consultancy Service for Enhancing Laboratory Surveillance of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Research Capability on Antimicrobial Resistance for the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, The Theme-Based Research Scheme of the Research Grants Council, Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen, and The High Level-Hospital Program, Health Commission of Guangdong Province, China.

0	Rapid Airborne Influenza Virus Quantification Using an Antibody-Based Electrochemical Paper Sensor and Electrostatic Particle Concentrator. Airborne influenza viruses are responsible for serious respiratory diseases, and most detection methods for airborne viruses are based on extraction of nucleic acids. Herein, vertical-flow-assay-based electrochemical paper immunosensors were fabricated to rapidly quantify the influenza H1N1 viruses in air after sampling with a portable electrostatic particle concentrator (EPC). The effects of antibodies, anti-influenza nucleoprotein antibodies (NP-Abs) and anti-influenza hemagglutinin antibodies (HA-Abs), on the paper sensors as well as nonpulsed high electrostatic fields with and without corona charging on the virus measurement were investigated. The antigenicity losses of the surface (HA) proteins were caused by H2O2 via lipid oxidation-derived radicals and 1O2 via direct protein peroxidation upon exposure of a high electrostatic field. However, minimal losses in antigenicity of NP of the influenza viruses were observed, and the concentration of the H1N1 viruses was more than 160 times higher in the EPC than the BioSampler upon using NP-Ab based paper sensors after 60 min collection. This NP-Ab-based paper sensors with the EPC provided measurements comparable to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) but much quicker, specific to the influenza H1N1 viruses in the presence of other airborne microorganisms and beads, and more cost-effective than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and qPCR.	false
0	Non-Oncological PET/CT imaging during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In December 2019 a new beta-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified in Wuhan Hubei Province, China. Within a few months it spread rapidly to more than 114 countries and the disease, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared pandemic on 11th February 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until 20 June 2020 8:09 am, 8,465,085 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed globally, with 454,258 deaths. The first incidence in Greece was documented on 26 February 2020 in Thessaloniki and up to 20 June 2020 8:09 am, 3,227 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, with 188 deaths. At the time of writing USA and Brazil, are the countries with the highest disease burden. Governments have imposed a variety of suggestions and restrictions in order to control the spread of the virus, focusing mainly on social distancing, self-isolation, personal hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE). Greece was one of the countries that implemented early drastic measures thus succeeding in controlling the virus transmission; having a profound economical effect though.	false
0	Possible modes of transmission of Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: a review. INTRODUCTION: The widespread outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 has raised numerous questions about the origin and transmission of the virus. Knowledge about the mode of transmission as well as assessing the effectiveness of the preventive measures would aid in containing the outbreak of the coronavirus. Presently, respiratory droplets, physical contact and aerosols/air-borne have been reported as the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of the virus. Besides, some of the other possible modes of transmission are being explored by the researchers, with some studies suggesting the viral spread through fecal-oral, conjunctival secretions, flatulence (farts), sexual and vertical transmission from mother to the fetus, and through asymptomatic carriers, etc. Aim: The primary objective was to review the present understanding and knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and also to suggest recommendations in containing and preventing the novel coronavirus., METHODS: A review of possible modes of transmission of the novel SARS-CoV-2 was conducted based on the reports and articles available in PubMed and ScienceDirect.com that were searched using keywords, 'transmission', 'modes of transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus', and 'COVID-19'. Articles referring to air-borne, conjunctiva, fecal-oral, maternal-fetal, flatulence (farts), and breast milk transmission were included, while the remaining were excluded., RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The modes of transmission linked to SARS-CoV-2 were identified and the available literature on each of these is described in detail in view of the possibilities of viral transmission through various modes of transmission. The review provides updated and necessary information on the possible modes of transmission for the health care workers and the lay public under one umbrella that can also be considered during framing guidelines in order to prevent and control the viral spread.	false

Globally, the prevalence of COVID-19 among beta-thalassemia patients seems to be lower than in general population; associated co-morbidities aggravated the severity of COVID- 19, leading to a poorer prognosis, irrespective of age. A multicenter registry will enhance the understanding of COVID-19 in these patients and will lead to more evidence-based management recommendations.	false
0	Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Dark Cloud With Silver Lining During the COVID-19 Pandemic. In December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia patients infected by a new virus from the coronavirus family called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus quickly spread around the world and infected millions of people, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although some patients show only mild or even asymptomatic response to this infection, severe disease with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress and multiorgan failure is also commonly seen. In this report, we discuss three cases of HIV patients who survived COVID-19. Copyright © 2020, Pata et al.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Detection for Diagnosis Purposes in the Setting of a Molecular Biology Research Lab. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases have created a major crisis for public health systems. The critical identification of contagious asymptomatic carriers requires the isolation of viral nucleic acids, reverse transcription, and amplification by PCR. However, the shortage of specific proprietary reagents or the lack of automated platforms have seriously hampered diagnostic throughput in many countries. Here, we provide a procedure for SARS-CoV-2 detection for diagnostic purposes from clinical samples in the setting of a basic research molecular biology lab. The procedure details the necessary steps for daily analysis of up to 500 clinical samples with a team composed of 12 experienced researchers. The protocol has been designed to rely on widely available reagents and devices, to cope with heterogeneous clinical specimens, to guarantee nucleic acid extraction from very scarce biological material, and to minimize the rate of false-negative results.	false
0	Clinical Profiles in Renal Patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to frequent referrals to the emergency department on suspicion of this infection in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and kidney transplant (KT) patients. We aimed to describe their clinical features comparing confirmed and suspected non-confirmed COVID-19 cases during the Spanish epidemic peak. Confirmed COVID-19 ((+)COVID-19) corresponds to patient with positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay. Non-confirmed COVID-19 ((-)COVID-19) corresponds to patients with negative RT-PCR. COVID-19 was suspected in 61 patients (40/803 KT (4.9%), 21/220 MHD (9.5%)). Prevalence of (+)COVID-19 was 3.2% in KT and 3.6% in MHD patients. Thirty-four (26 KT and 8 MHD) were (+)COVID-19 and 27 (14 KT and 13 MHD) (-)COVID-19. In comparison with (-)COVID-19 patients, (+)COVID-19 showed higher frequency of typical viral symptoms (cough, dyspnea, asthenia and myalgias), pneumonia (88.2% vs. 14.3%) and LDH and CRP while lower phosphate levels, need of hospital admission (100% vs. 63%), use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (36% vs. 11%) and mortality (38% vs. 0%) (p < 0.001). Time from symptoms onset to admission was longer in patients who finally died than in survivors (8.5 vs. 3.8, p = 0.007). In KT and MHD patients, (+)COVID-19 shows more clinical severity than suspected non-confirmed cases. Prompt RT-PCR is mandatory to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis.	false
0	Early use of low dose tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study with a complete follow-up. Background: Pneumonia with severe respiratory failure represents the principal cause of death in COVID-19, where hyper-inflammation plays an important role in lung damage. An effective treatment aiming at reducing the inflammation without preventing virus clearance is thus urgently needed. Tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been proposed for treatment of patients with COVID-19., Methods: A retrospective cohort study at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy, was conducted. We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia at the early stage of respiratory failure, all treated with a standard protocol (hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily, lopinavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg per day). We compared survival rate and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with tocilizumab once (either 400 mg intravenous or 324 mg subcutaneous) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive tocilizumab (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at the end of the follow-up, that correspond to death or complete recovery and discharge from the hospital., Findings: 158 patients were included, 90 of which received tocilizumab. 34 out of 68 (50%) patients in the standard treatment group and 7 out of 90 (7.7%) in the tocilizumab group died. Tocilizumab significantly improved survival compared to standard care (multivariate HR: 0.057; 95% C.I = 0.017- 0.187, p < 0.001). No differences between the two administration routes of tocilizumab were observed. No tocilizumab-related infections and/or side effects were observed., Interpretation: Early treatment with tocilizumab could be helpful to prevent excessive hyper-inflammation and death in COVID-19 related pneumonia. Low dose administration of tocilizumab is not associated with adverse events., Funding: none. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	"Predictive role of clinical features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for severe disease. OBJECTIVES: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has spread rapidly in China and many other countries. The rapid increase in the number of cases has caused widespread panic among people and has become the main public health problem in the world. Severe patients often have difficult breathing and/or hypoxemia after 1 week of onset. A few critically ill patients may not only rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, but also may cause coagulopathy, as well as multiple organs failure (such as heart, liver and kidney) or even death. This article is to analyze the predictive role of clinical features in patients with COVID-19 for severe disease, so as to help doctor monitor the severity-related features, restrain the disease progress, and provide a reference for improvement of medical treatment., METHODS: The clinical data of 208 patients with COVID-19 who were isolated and treated in Changsha Public Health Treatment Center from January 17, 2020 to March 14, 2020 were collected. All patients were the mild and ordinary adult patients on admission, including 105 males and 103 females from 19 to 84 (median age 44) years old. According to the ""Program for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infected pneumonia (Trial version 7)"" issued by the General Office of National Health Committee and Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the diagnostic and typing criteria. According to progression from mild to severe disease during hospitalization, the patients were divided into a mild group (n=183) and a severe transformation group (n=25). The clinical features such as age, underlying disease, blood routine, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, oxygenation index, and so on were analyzed. Among them, laboratory tests included white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), plasma fibrinogen (Fib), activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), D-dimer, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and oxygen partial pressure in arterial blood. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fractional concentration of inspiratory oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated. The variables with statistical significance were analyzed by logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Patients in the severe transformation group had more combined underlying diseases than those in the mild group (P<0.05). From the perspective of disease distribution, patients in the severe transformation group had more combined hypertension (P<0.05). In the severe transformation group, PT was significantly longer, the levels of Fib, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP were significantly higher than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001), while LYM, ALB, and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical features with statistically significant differences. Combined with hypertension, LYM, PT, Fib, ALB, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP as independent variables, and having severe disease or not was the dependent variable. The results show that combined hypertension, decreased LYM, longer PT, and increased CK level were independent risk factors that affected the severity of COVID-19 (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The patients with mild COVID-19 who are apt to develop severe diseases may be related to combined hypertension, decreased LYM, and longer PT, and increased CK level. For the mild patients with these clinical features, early intervention may effectively prevent the progression to severe diseases."	false
0	The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on head and neck cancer services: A UK tertiary centre study. Background. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has necessitated almost exclusive National Health Service focus on emergency work and cancer care. There are concerns that increased hospital and community pressures will lead to decreased referrals and worse outcomes for head and neck cancer patients. Method. This is a retrospective review of all cases referred for suspected head and neck cancer to our institution in January and April 2020. Results. There was a 55 per cent decrease in referrals but diagnostic yield rose from 2.9 per cent in January to 8.06 per cent in April. In both months, 100 per cent of patients met the 31- and 62-day targets, with similar 14-day wait time success (97.83 per cent for January vs 98.33 per cent for April[Q1]). Referrals for laryngopharyngeal reflux rose from 27.5 per cent to 41.9 per cent. Referrals for those aged over 60 years fell from 42 per cent to 26 per cent. Conclusion. It is suggested that further research be conducted into the reasons why fewer patients were referred, particularly elderly patients, and why laryngopharyngeal reflux is so prevalent in fast-track referrals.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

0	Diagnosis of COVID-19 Based on Symptomatic Analysis of Hospital Healthcare Workers in Belgium: Observational Study in a Large Belgian Tertiary Care Center during Early COVID-19 Outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To identify early symptoms allowing rapid appraisal of infection with SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers of a large Belgian hospital. METHOD(S): Healthcare workers with mild symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection were systematically screened on clinical characteristics of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken and analyzed by real-time Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (rRT-PCR). RESULT(S): Fifty percent of 373 workers tested COVID-19 positive. The symptoms cough (82%), headache (78%), myalgia (70%), loss of smell or taste (40%), and fever >=37.5degreeC (76%) were significantly higher among those infected. CONCLUSION(S): Where each individual symptom contributes to the clinical evaluation of possible infection, it is the combination of COVID-19 symptoms that could allow for a rapid diagnostic appraisal of the disease in a high prevalence setting. Early transmission control is important at the onset of an epidemic.	false
0	Impact of glycemic control in diabetes mellitus on management of COVID-19 infection. Background: Diabetes mellitus may be associated with increased severity and enhanced mortality in COVID-19 infections. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, radiological imaging, management, and outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients of diabetes mellitus and its association with glycemic control. Method(s): The present study was designed to evaluate the difference between uncontrolled and controlled diabetes for COVID-19 manifestations by enrolling 80 admitted COVID-19 patients. Patients were categorized into two groups, where group 1 had patients with uncontrolled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c > 8 g% and group 2 had patients with controlled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c < 8 g%. Information concerning medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological imaging, management, and outcome was extracted from medical records for evaluation, interpretation, and association among both the groups. Result(s): COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes exhibited a severe symptomatic presentation, excessive uncontrolled inflammatory responses, and hypercoagulable state. Total leukocyte count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, serum levels of IL-6, FDP, and D-dimer were significantly raised (p < 0.05) in case of uncontrolled diabetes as compared with controlled diabetes. Radiological findings detected by chest radiograph and computed tomography chest suggested severe lung involvement in uncontrolled diabetes. COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes required intensive treatment as compared with controlled diabetes group in terms of insulin therapy (p = 0.0226) and non-invasive ventilation (p = 0.0292). Patients with uncontrolled diabetes had higher mortality (p = 0.0375) and required prolonged hospitalization (p = 0.0479) as compared with controlled diabetes group. Conclusion(s): From the current study, it can be concluded that uncontrolled diabetic condition might be a risk factor for severity and morbidity of COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus might be responsible for an overall higher susceptibility for COVID-19 infection and severity in terms of symptomatic presentation, inflammatory storm, rapid pulmonary invasion, requirement of more intensive treatment, and a poor outcome.Copyright © 2020, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India.	false
0	How Do We Combat Bogus Medicines in the Age of the COVID-19 Pandemic?. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought concurrent challenges. The increased incidence of fake and falsified product distribution is one of these problems with tremendous impact, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Up to a tenth of medicines including antibiotics and antimalarial drugs in the African market are considered falsified. Pandemics make this worse by creating an ecosystem of confusion, distraction, and vulnerability stemming from the pandemic as health systems become more stressed and the workload of individuals increased. These environments create opportunities for substandard and falsified medicines to be more easily introduced into the marketplace by unscrupulous operators. In this work, we discussed some of the challenges with fake or falsified product distribution in the context of COVID-19 and proposed strategies to best manage this problem.	false

0	How to overcome cardiovascular challenges in COVID-19 patients: a guide for common practice. The COVID-19 epidemic initially started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 due to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to the bat beta-coronavirus genus, but the novel specie of this genus can infect humans. The most common clinical features of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and dyspnea. The primary reported mortality rate was about 2-3% in China; however, it reached up to 10% among patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. The primary epidemiological investigations showed a high prevalence of underlying cardiovascular diseases in more than 40% of infected patients. A high prevalence of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were reported among deceased patients in Italy. Previous experiments in different pandemic situations showed that the cardiovascular system has been affected in many ways. Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reported that cardiovascular co-morbidities had a direct correlation with the risk of infection, the severity of disease, and the mortality rate. Therefore, brief and available protocols for controlling the negative effects of this novel respiratory infection on the cardiovascular system, especially in a high-risk populations with underlying cardiovascular conditions, is one of the most serious concerns among healthcare providers. Herein, we aimed to review the available data on the cardiac manifestation of COVID-19. Besides, we described useful maps for the better treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions, as a high-risk group of patients.	false
0	Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China: comparison between imported and local cases. INTRODUCTION: An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across the globe since the end of 2019. Shenzhen confirmed its first imported case from Wuhan on 19 January 2020. However, little is known regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in these imported cities., METHODOLOGY: Data of all 417 confirmed cases diagnosed in Shenzhen before 29 February were collected. The epidemiological characteristics of imported and local cases were compared. The resilience to COVID-19 was evaluated by discharge density., RESULTS: All ten districts reported COVID-19 cases by 29 February, including 331 imported and 86 local cases. The Pearson linear correlation model showed the number of confirmed cases (r = 0.990, p < 0.001) as well as incidence of COVID-19 (r = 0.766, p = 0.010) was positively correlated with the gross domestic product of district. Family clusters were more commonly found in local cases. Imported patients had earlier onset (p < 0.001) and diagnosis (p < 0.001), but longer interval from onset to admission (p = 0.030), diagnosis (p = 0.003) and discharge (p = 0.016). Older and severe cases had lower discharge density (0.024 and 0.018, respectively); while cases with subclinical symptoms exhibited higher discharge density (0.052)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients were predominantly imported cases in Shenzhen and the spatial distribution was closely related to district GDP. Imported and local cases differed in the intervals from onset to admission, diagnosis and discharge. Moreover, family-based transmission should not be ignored, especially in local cases.

0	Fighting the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic: Employing lessons from the Ebola virus disease response. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that affects the lower respiratory tract and appears as pneumonia in humans. COVID-19 became apparent in December 2019 in Wuhan City of China, and has propagated profusely globally. Despite stringent global quarantine and containment drives, the incidence of COVID-19 keeps soaring high. Measures to minimize human-to-human transmission have been implemented to control the pandemic. However, special efforts to reduce transmission via efficient public health communications and dissemination of risks should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and the elderly. In response to this global pandemic, this article summarizes proven strategies that could be employed to combat the COVID-19 disease outbreak, taking a cue from lessons learned from the Ebola virus disease response.

0	COVID-19 in a Patient with Accidental Drug-Induced Neutropenia. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with a wide range of illness severity, from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, but there are only few reports on disease progression in immunocompromised patients., Case Summary: We report the case of a 50-year-old patient with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, who had iatrogenic, clinically relevant bone marrow suppression due to accidental overdose with hydroxyurea, and decreased lung capacity due to a left-sided pneumonectomy 6 months earlier. Symptomatic treatment with oxygen supplementation and pulmonary physical therapy was initiated, and hydroxyurea was discontinued. Over 14 days, the patient's blood counts slowly recovered, and his clinical condition gradually improved, such that supplemental oxygen was no longer necessary and he could be discharged., Discussion: A gradual increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts may be preferable to dampen a potentially detrimental immunological response triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether patients with severe COVID-19 benefit from immunosuppressive therapy should be further evaluated., LEARNING POINTS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a serious complication in COVID-19 and appears to be triggered by a proinflammatory cytokine storm.Immunosuppression may avoid an immune hyper-response triggered by SARS-CoV-2.

0	Towards COVID-19 Prophylaxis: An AIDS Preclinical Research Perspective. The success of an antiviral drug depends on its potency to neutralize the virus in vitro and its ability after administration in vivo to reach the anatomic compartments that fuel viral dissemination in the body. For instance, remdesivir, a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug based on studies in vitro, if administered orally would be poorly effective because low drug levels would reach the lungs due to its high first pass destruction in the liver. This is the reason remdesivir can only be administered intravenously, a requirement that clearly limits its use as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19, although novel formulations for its easier administration are under development. Whether an antiviral prophylaxis could further control or even stop the COVID-19 epidemic in synergy with other non-pharmacological based mitigation strategies is today unknown. Since the mid-1960s, pharmacologists have investigated the use of lipid-based nanoparticles for efficient delivery of antivirals to tissues, for example by transforming the route of administration from intravenous to oral, subcutaneous or aerosol administrations. These novel encapsulation strategies have also the potential to maintain high levels of the antiviral drugs in tissues, with reduced dose frequency compared to the non-encapsulated drug. Several lipid-based nanoparticles are today approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or being tested in clinical studies with favorable toxicity profiles. Nonhuman primate models of coronavirus infection offer unique platforms to accelerate the search for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral prophylaxis. Paradigms, to corroborate this claim, are borrowed from nonhuman primate research studies, some of which had a profound impact on global public health in the specific setting of the AIDS pandemic. Sharing information from nonhuman primate research programs, invoking principles of scientific transparency and bioethics similar to those universally agreed for human studies, would also likely significantly help our collective fight (as the human species) against this public health emergency.	false
0	Modeling COVID-19 epidemic in Heilongjiang province, China. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) surges worldwide. However, massive imported patients especially into Heilongjiang Province in China recently have been an alert for local COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data from January 23 to March 25 from Heilongjiang province and trained an ordinary differential equation model to fit the epidemic data. We extended the simulation using this trained model to characterize the effect of an imported 'escaper'. We showed that an imported 'escaper' was responsible for the newly confirmed COVID-19 infections from Apr 9 to Apr 19 in Heilongjiang province. Stochastic simulations further showed that significantly increased local contacts among imported 'escaper', its epidemiologically associated cases and susceptible populations greatly contributed to the local outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, we further found that the reported number of asymptomatic patients was markedly lower than model predictions implying a large asymptomatic pool which was not identified. We further forecasted the effect of implementing strong interventions immediately to impede COVID-19 outbreak for Heilongjiang province. Implementation of stronger interventions to lower mutual contacts could accelerate the complete recovery from coronavirus infections in Heilongjiang province. Collectively, our model has characterized the epidemic of COVID-19 in Heilongjiang province and implied that strongly controlled measured should be taken for infected and asymptomatic patients to minimize total infections.

0	Single-cell RNA sequencing of Tocilizumab-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an in vitro model of inflammation. COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to global health. Early data has revealed that IL-6, a key regulatory cytokine, plays an important role in the cytokine storm of COVID-19. Multiple trials are therefore looking at the effects of Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody that inhibits IL-6 activity, on treatment of COVID-19, with promising findings. As part of a clinical trial looking at the effects of Tocilizumab treatment on kidney transplant recipients with subclinical rejection, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of comparing stimulated PBMCs before and after Tocilizumab treatment. We leveraged this data to create an in vitro cytokine storm model, to better understand the effects of Tocilizumab in the presence of inflammation. Tocilizumab-treated cells had reduced expression of inflammatory-mediated genes and biologic pathways, particularly amongst monocytes. These results support the hypothesis that Tocilizumab may hinder the cytokine storm of COVID-19, through a demonstration of biologic impact at the single-cell level.	false
0	Tuberculosis in migrants - screening, surveillance and ethics. Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of human mortality and is responsible for nearly 2 million deaths every year. It is often regarded as a 'silent killer' because it predominantly affects the poor and marginalized, and disease outbreaks occur in 'slow motion' compared to Ebola or coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). In low incidence countries, TB is predominantly an imported disease and TB control in migrants is pivotal for countries to progress towards TB elimination in accordance with the World Health Organisations (WHO's) End TB strategy. This review provides a brief overview of the different screening approaches and surveillance processes that are in place in low TB incidence countries. It also includes a detailed discussion of the ethical issues related to TB screening of migrants in these settings and the different interests that need to be balanced. Given recognition that a holistic approach that recognizes and respects basic human rights is required to end TB, the review considers the complexities that require consideration in low-incidence countries that are aiming for TB elimination.

0	Hypoxia response and acute lung and kidney injury: possible implications for therapy of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic of unprecedented severity affecting millions of people around the world and causing several hundred thousands of deaths. The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective. Considering these promising experimental data, we hypothesize that PHD inhibitors could be considered as a possible new therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Relationship between COVID-19 and weather: Case study in a tropical country. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between weather factors (temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and rainfall) and COVID-19 infection in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Solar radiation showed a strong (-0.609, p < 0.01) negative correlation with the incidence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Temperature (maximum and average) and wind speed showed negative correlation (p < 0.01). Therefore, in this studied tropical state, high solar radiation can be indicated as the main climatic factor that suppress the spread of COVID-19. High temperatures, and wind speed also are potential factors. Therefore, the findings of this study show the ability to improve the organizational system of strategies to combat the pandemic in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and other tropical countries around the word.

0	Combination treatment of short-course systemic corticosteroid and favipiravir in a successfully treated case of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia with COPD. Use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is not well described. A 58-year-old man with fever and progressive dyspnea was admitted to the Showa University Hospital, and showed severe respiratory failure which needed mechanical ventilation. His chest computed tomography scanning showed emphysema and bilateral ground-glass opacity caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. He received 30 mg prednisolone for five days with antiviral drug of favipiravir, and was successfully extubated on day five. A SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test became negative on day 15. He was discharged on day 21. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 converted to positive on day 7 and they kept positive on day 54 for both IgM and IgG. Combination treatment of short-course systemic corticosteroid and favipiravir might improve the prognosis for critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia with COPD without negative influence on viral clearance or antibody production.

0	"Application of a Biologically Contained Reporter System To Study Gain-of-Function H5N1 Influenza A Viruses with Pandemic Potential. Natural adaptation of an antigenically novel avian influenza A virus (IAV) to be transmitted efficiently in humans has the potential to trigger a devastating pandemic. Understanding viral genetic determinants underlying adaptation is therefore critical for pandemic preparedness, as the knowledge gained enhances surveillance and eradication efforts, prepandemic vaccine design, and efficacy assessment of antivirals. However, this work has risks, as making gain-of-function substitutions in fully infectious IAVs may create a pathogen with pandemic potential. Thus, such experiments must be tightly controlled through physical and biological risk mitigation strategies. Here, we applied a previously described biological containment system for IAVs to a 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain and a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. The system relies on deletion of the essential viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene, which is instead provided in trans, thereby restricting multicycle virus replication to genetically modified HA-complementing cells. In place of HA, a Renilla luciferase gene is inserted within the viral genome, and a live-cell luciferase substrate allows real-time quantitative monitoring of viral replication kinetics with a high dynamic range. We demonstrate that biologically contained IAV-like particles exhibit wild-type sensitivities to approved antivirals, including oseltamivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir. Furthermore, the inability of these IAV-like particles to genetically acquire the host-encoded HA allowed us to introduce gain-of-function substitutions in the H5 HA gene that promote mammalian transmissibility. Biologically contained ""transmissible"" H5N1 IAV-like particles exhibited wild-type sensitivities to approved antivirals, to the fusion inhibitor S20, and to neutralization by existing H5 monoclonal and polyclonal sera. This work represents a proof of principle that biologically contained IAV systems can be used to safely conduct selected gain-of-function experiments. IMPORTANCE Understanding how animal influenza viruses can adapt to spread in humans is critical to prepare for, and prevent, new pandemics. However, working safely with pathogens that have pandemic potential requires tight regulation and the use of high-level physical and biological risk mitigation strategies to stop accidental loss of containment. Here, we used a biological containment system for influenza viruses to study strains with pandemic potential. The system relies on deletion of the essential HA gene from the viral genome and its provision by a genetically modified cell line, to which virus propagation is therefore restricted. We show that this method permits safe handling of these pathogens, including gain-of-function variants, without the risk of generating fully infectious viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this system can be used to assess virus sensitivity to both approved and experimental drugs, as well as the antigenic profile of viruses, important considerations for evaluating prepandemic vaccine and antiviral strategies.

0	Sensitivity, Specificity and Predictive Values of Molecular and Serological Tests for COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study in Emergency Room. BACKGROUND: We assessed the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of molecular and serological tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A total of 346 patients were enrolled in the emergency room. We evaluated three Reverse Transcriptase-real time PCRs (RT-PCRs) including six different gene targets, five serologic rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and one ELISA. The final classification of infected/non-infected patients was performed using Latent Class Analysis combined with clinical re-assessment of incongruous cases., RESULTS: Out of these, 24.6% of patients were classified as infected. The molecular test RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 showed the highest performance with 91.8% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100.0% PPV and 97.4% NPV respectively. Considering the single gene targets, S and RdRp of RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 had the highest sensitivity (94.1%). The in-house RdRp presented the lowest sensitivity (62.4%). The specificity ranged from 99.2% for in-house RdRp and N2 to 95.0% for E. The PPV ranged from 97.1% of N2 to 85.4% of E and the NPV from 98.1% of S to 89.0% of in-house RdRp. All serological tests had < 50% sensitivity and low PPV and NPV. VivaDiag IgM (RDT) had 98.5% specificity, with 84.0% PPV, but 24.7% sensitivity., CONCLUSION: Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection showed excellent specificity, but significant differences in sensitivity. Serological tests have limited utility in a clinical context.	false

0	Cocamidopropyl Betaine Surfactant 0.075% Solution in Physiological Serum for Hygiene Process of COVID-19 Intubated Patients. When using ventilators in the management of the coronavirus disease 2019 patient, dense and abundant mucous secretions are formed, obstructing the endotracheal tube and making its aspiration difficult. This situation is worsened if in order to minimize the risk of infection of the medical personnel, the humidifier is disconnected. This circumstance forces the tube to be removed, cleaned, or changed, increasing the workload of the intensive care unit staff. Other therapies tested until now, like mesna, acetylcysteine, or hypertonic saline solution, are valid alternatives, although they have not shown great efficacy for this specific procedure in the past. The sanitary emergency forced the collaboration between a pharmacist and an otorhinolaryngologist to develop the cocamidopropyl betaine surfactant formula, after several tests with different concentrations of the surfactant. The objective of this compounding formula was to resolve a mechanical problem and avoid reintubation due to obstruction of the ventilator tube. The cocamidopropyl betaine surfactant solution 0.075% in saline 0.9% (physiological serum) solution demonstrated to be a well-tolerated formula, using inexpensive materials, was simple to prepare, and was easy to use in clinical practice.

0	Epidemic features of coronavirus disease 2019 in Henan Province. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the regional epidemic features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Henan Province, China., METHODS: According to the data of COVID-19 patients and the resident population at the end of 2018 in Henan Province, statistical description and analysis of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province were conducted, including the time distribution, population distribution, and regional distribution., RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 1.32/100 000, the cure rate was 98.03%, and the fatality rate was 1.73% by March 9, 2020. The incidence curve showed that the epidemic peak reached from January 24 to January 28. The high-incidence area was Xinyang, with a standardized cumulative incidence rate of 4.36/100 000. There were 580 female COVID-19 patients (45.60%), 688 males (54.09%) in Henan Province. The incidence of males was 1.41/100 000, while the incidence of females was 1.23/100 000. The age with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 20-69 years old (88.68%). The incidence rate was highest in men aged 30-39 (2.51/ 100 000), while the lowest rate in women aged 0-9 (0.16/100 000). There were 1 225 local patients (96.31%), and the rural patients (45.73%) were slightly higher than the urban patients (44.02%) in Henan Province. A total of 63.60% patients had traveled or lived in Hubei or contacted with people who came from Hubei to Henan. The proportion of patients whose family members suffered from COVID-19 was 32.70%. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested that there was a statistically significant positive correlation in the spatial distribution of COVID-19 patients in Henan Province (Moran's I=0.248, Z=2.955, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients in different areas of Henan Province, with epidemic peak reaching from January 24 to January 28. Henan is dominated by local patients, male patients, and patients with contact history in Hubei. The space appears to be moderately clustered.	false
0	[SARS-CoV-2 and Perinatal Aspects]. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has developed into a pandemic, yet still has many unknowns. The modalities of transmission, different symptoms and manifestations as well as concomitant circumstances of the disease are insufficiently characterized. Especially patient groups in special situations like pregnant women and newborns have to be considered separately. The current knowledge about pregnancy, labor and the first days of life is characterized by particular uncertainty due to the scarce data available. However, there is currently no evidence of significant unfavorable maternal and perinatal outcome. Many pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic. The possibility of vertical transmission to the child cannot be excluded with certainty. However, indications of vertical transmission were detected only in individual cases. Newborn infections are also rather rare, unspecific and usually mild, with respiratory symptoms dominating. In this article, the data available to date are examined in order to provide better information, advice and treatment for pregnant women and newborns with SARS-CoV-2 and to provide suggestions for future research.

0	Unusual arterial thrombotic events in Covid-19 patients. Introduction: COVID-19 infection is commonly complicated with pro-thrombotic state and endothelial dysfunction. While several studies reported a high incidence of venous thromboembolic events. The occurrence of arterial thromboses are yet rarely described and could be underestimated. Objective(s): To describe the clinical and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients presenting with an associated arterial thromboembolic event. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a retrospective multicentric study in 3 centers between France and Italy. All patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and arterial thromboembolic events were included in the analysis. Result(s): From March 8th to April 25th 2020, we identified 20 patients (24 events) with arterial thromboembolic events over 209 admitted patients (9.6%) with severe COVID-19 infection. Arterial thrombotic events included acute coronary occlusions (n = 9), stroke (n = 6), limb ischemia (n = 3), splenic infarcts (n = 3), aortic thrombosis (n = 2) and occlusive mesenteric ischemia (n = 1). At the time of the event, 10/20 (50%) of patients received thromboprohylaxis, 2/20 (10%) were receiving treatment dose anticoagulation and 5/20 (25%) were receiving antiplatelet therapy. Conclusion(s): Our observations suggest that serious arterial thrombotic events might occur in Covid-19 patients. However, the exact incidence of such events and the best way to prevent them yet remains to be investigated.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 in Patients with Hematologic Disorders Undergoing Therapy: Perspective of a Large Referral Hematology Center in Rome. INTRODUCTION: Patients with cancer may be more susceptible to and have higher morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 than the general population, while epidemiologic data specifically addressed to hematologic patients are limited. To investigate whether patients with hematologic diseases undergoing therapy are at increased risk for acquiring SARS CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, a retrospective study was carried out at a referral hematologic center in Rome, Italy, during the period of the greatest epidemic spread (March 8 to May 14, 2020). METHOD(S): All adult and pediatric patients with a diagnosis of a neoplastic or a nonneoplastic hematologic disease who underwent treatment (chemotherapy or immunosuppressive or supportive therapy) during the study period or in the previous 6 months were considered. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the overall outpatient and inpatient population undergoing hematologic treatment compared to that of the general population was analyzed. The measures taken to manage patients during the epidemic period are described. RESULT(S): Overall, 2,513 patients with hematological diseases were considered. Out of 243 (9.7%) patients who were screened for SARS CoV-2, three of 119 (2.5%) outpatients with fever or respiratory symptoms and none of 124 asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Three further patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and managed in other hospitals in Rome. As of May 14, 2020, the prevalence of COVID-19 in our hematologic population accounted for 0.24% (95% CI 0.23-0.25; 6 of 2,513 patients: 1 case in every 419 patients) as compared to 0.12% (7,280 of 5,879,082 residents; 1 case in every 807 residents) in the general population (p = 0.14). Three of 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 required critical care and 2 died while still positive for SARS CoV-2. Out of 225 healthcare providers on duty at our Institution during the study period, 2 (0.9%) symptomatic cases were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): In our experience, the prevalence of COVID-19 in hematologic patients, mainly affected by malignancies, was not significantly higher compared to that of the general population. Definition of adapted strategies for healthcare services, while continuing to administer the standard hematologic treatments, represents the crucial challenge for the management of hematologic diseases in the COVID-19 era.Copyright © 2020 S.

0	Phylogeography of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Spain: a story of multiple introductions, micro-geographic stratification, founder effects, and super-spreaders. Spain has been one of the main global pandemic epicenters for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we analyzed >41 000 genomes (including >26 000 high-quality (HQ) genomes) downloaded from the GISAID repository, including 1 245 (922 HQ) sampled in Spain. The aim of this study was to investigate genome variation of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reconstruct phylogeographic and transmission patterns in Spain. Phylogeographic analysis suggested at least 34 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Spain at the beginning of the outbreak. Six lineages spread very successfully in the country, probably favored by super-spreaders, namely, A2a4 (7.8%), A2a5 (38.4%), A2a10 (2.8%), B3a (30.1%), and B9 (8.7%), which accounted for 87.9% of all genomes in the Spanish database. One distinct feature of the Spanish SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the higher frequency of B lineages (39.3%, mainly B3a+B9) than found in any other European country. While B3a, B9, (and an important sub-lineage of A2a5, namely, A2a5c) most likely originated in Spain, the other three haplogroups were imported from other European locations. The B3a strain may have originated in the Basque Country from a B3 ancestor of uncertain geographic origin, whereas B9 likely emerged in Madrid. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the first coronavirus entered the country around 11 February 2020, as estimated from the TMRCA of B3a, the first lineage detected in the country. Moreover, earlier claims that the D614G mutation is associated to higher transmissibility is not consistent with the very high prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain when compared to other countries with lower disease incidence but much higher frequency of this mutation (56.4% in Spain vs. 82.4% in rest of Europe). Instead, the data support a major role of genetic drift in modeling the micro-geographic stratification of virus strains across the country as well as the role of SARS-CoV-2 super-spreaders.	false
0	Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19: filling the gap between myocarditis and Kawasaki?. Myocarditis and Kawasaki disease are common but usually distinct diseases in children. During the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), reports of a new form of myocarditis with clinical features of Kawasaki appeared. We investigated the place of this new disease in the spectrum encompassing Kawasaki disease and myocarditis. Thirty two consecutive children referred to our centre for a suspicion of Kawasaki or a diagnosis of myocarditis were included and eventually divided into four groups: 11 Kawasaki diseases, 6 Kawasaki syndromes (children with another diagnosis), 7 myocarditis without Kawasaki clinical feature and 7 myocarditis with incomplete Kawasaki clinical features. All were treated with immunoglobulins except those of the myocarditis group. The survival rate was 91%. The 7 children with myocarditis and clinical features of incomplete Kawasaki were all positive for SARS-CoV-2. They had a transient myocardial failure with a favourable course and none had coronary artery disease. Conclusion(s): Every COVID-19 child within our population had a mild to severe myocarditis and presented with fever plus two or three Kawasaki clinical features. Short-term evolution was good for these children. This new disease seems to fill the gap between isolated myocarditis and Kawasaki disease.What is Known:* A new paediatric disease close to Kawasaki disease appeared during the COVID-19 pandemicWhat is New:* In our population, children presented with fever, vivid Kawasaki clinical features (although the Kawasaki syndrome was always incomplete) and a myocarditis without coronary abnormalities.* The new disease fills the gap between paediatric myocarditis and Kawasaki disease but its prognosis is much better.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Management of pernio-like cutaneous manifestations in children during the outbreak of covid-19. BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of COVID-19 many pernio-like lesions have been increasingly reported. The aim of the study is to describe our management of these skin manifestations and to evaluate a possible correlation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD(S): All patients underwent clinical and laboratory tests to detect a possible underlying connective disease and also to specific SARS-CoV-2 investigations such as oropharyngeal swab and IgG-IgM serology. RESULT(S): Nine patients aged between five and fifteen years old were evaluated. Skin lesions observed were purplish, erythematous and oedematous, in some cases painful and itchy. Six out of nine had respiratory and systemic symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, chills, fever, asthenia) that preceded cutaneous findings of approximately two weeks. Concerning blood exams, three out of nine had D-dimer weakly increased, four had ANA positivity: two with a title 1:160, one with 1:320 and one with 1:5120 and a speckled pattern. The latter patient had also ENA SS-A positive and RF positivity, confirmed at a second check, so as to allow us to make a diagnosis of connective tissue disease. Four out of nine had aPL positivity (IgM). Reactants acute phase were all negative. Oropharyngeal swabs and serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (borderline in one patient for IgM). No treatment was needed. CONCLUSION(S): Even if we do not have enough data to prove it, we hypothesize a correlation between pernio-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2 infection for an increased number of these lesions described during the pandemic and also because such manifestations appeared when temperatures were mild and patients were at home in isolation for the lockdown.

0	Lowering the Transmission and Spread of Human Coronavirus. OBJECTIVES: The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented healthcare, social, and economic disaster. Wearing of masks and social distancing can significantly decrease transmission and spread, however due to circumstances such as medical or dental intervention and personal choice these practices have not been universally adopted. Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of HCoV, may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. METHOD(S): Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 sec, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay. RESULT(S): A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2 min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30 sec contact time. CONCLUSION(S): In the current manuscript we have demonstrated that several commonly available healthcare products have significant virucidal properties with respect to HCoV.

0	Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein glycan shield reveals implications for immune recognition. Here we have generated 3D structures of glycoforms of the spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2, based on reported 3D structures and glycomics data for the protein produced in HEK293 cells. We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the innate and adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight of the S trimer (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) they shield approximately 40% of the protein surface.	false
0	Fatal central nervous system co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis in a healthy child. BACKGROUND: Central and peripheral nervous system symptoms and complications are being increasingly recognized among individuals with pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infections, but actual detection of the virus or its RNA in the central nervous system has rarely been sought or demonstrated. Severe or fatal illnesses are attributed to SARS-CoV-2, generally without attempting to evaluate for alternative causes or co-pathogens. CASE PRESENTATION: A five-year-old girl with fever and headache was diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2-associated meningoencephalitis based on the detection of its RNA on a nasopharyngeal swab, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Serial serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA showed seroconversion, consistent with an acute infection. Mental status and brain imaging findings gradually worsened despite antiviral therapy and intravenous dexamethasone. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy for brain herniation with cerebellar biopsy on day 30 of illness, shortly before death, revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Diagnostic Panel. On histopathology, necrotizing granulomas with numerous acid-fast bacilli were visualized, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was detected by PCR. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid that day was negative for mycobacterial DNA. Tracheal aspirate samples for mycobacterial DNA and culture from days 22 and 27 of illness were negative by PCR but grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 8weeks, long after the child's passing. She had no known exposures to tuberculosis and no chest radiographic findings to suggest it. All 6 family members had normal chest radiographs and negative interferon-gamma release assay results. The source of her tuberculous infection was not identified, and further investigations by the local health department were not possible because of the State of Michigan-mandated lockdown for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread. CONCLUSION(S): The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue and the demonstration of seroconversion in IgG and IgA assays was consistent with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous infection. However, the cause of death was brain herniation from her rapidly progressive central nervous system tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 may mask or worsen occult tuberculous infection with severe or fatal consequences.	false
0	Performance of an automated chemiluminescence SARS-COV-2 IG-G Assay. INTRODUCTION: We describe our evaluation of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay on the Architect immunoassay analyser. METHOD(S): We assessed assay precision, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV), cross-reactivity (influenza/dengue/hepatitis B and C/rheumatoid factor/anti-nuclear/double-stranded DNA/syphilis) and sample throughput in samples from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients/healthcare workers (HCWs)/pre-pandemic samples. We compared the cut-off indexes (COIs) between all control samples (HCWs and pre-pandemic) to generate an optimised COI limit for reactivity. RESULT(S): The assay specificity was 99.8% (n=980) and sensitivity was 45.9-96.7% (n=279). When tested >=14 days post-positive RT-PCR (POS), the PPV/NPV was 96.4%/99.8%. The difference between the COIs of HCWs/pre-pandemic samples was small (0.01, p<0.0001). There was minimal cross-reactivity with other antibodies. A lower COI limit for reactivity (>=0.55, using the 99th percentile COI of our controls and ROC analysis) improved diagnostic sensitivity, especially at 0-6 days POS (45.9% to 55.8%), with a small decrease in specificity (98.9%). The assay throughput was 100 samples in 70 min. CONCLUSION(S): The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay shows excellent performance in patients >=14 days POS. The difference between the COIs of HCWs and pre-pandemic samples was numerically small. A lower COI limit improves assay sensitivity with a slight decrease in specificity.Copyright © 2020.

0	Potential statin drug interactions in elderly patients: a review. INTRODUCTION: Persons aged more than 65 years may be more prone to suffer from chronic diseases and comorbidities (as demonstrated by the recent COVID-19 pandemics) and are treated with multiple concomitant medications. This may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that are often overlooked in clinical practice. Elderly patients are more affected by comorbidities increasing the risk of DDIs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Statins are effective in elderly patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are prescribed on a long-term basis and may undergo DDIs, particularly on pharmacokinetic bases. The risk of DDIs varies among statins, and safety and ADRs of statins are of special concern in patients affected by multiple chronic conditions requiring concomitant therapies at risk of DDIs, such as the elderly. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this manuscript is to give an update on the potential statin DDIs and related ADRs with an exclusive focus on the data available in elderly patients. EXPERT OPINION: A better and more close attention to the potential DDIs among statins and other therapeutic options will help physicians in selecting the more effective and less harmful treatment for their patients. This is of importance, especially in older patients.	false
0	The Enigma of Low COVID-19 Fatality Rate in India. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute onset pneumonia caused by a novel Betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Though its origin has been linked to the Wuhan City of China's Hubei Province in December 2019, recent reports claim that the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus probably happened sometime between September and October 2019 in Guangdong Province, rather than Hubei. As of July 3, 2020, India has reported a case positivity rate of 6.5% and a fatality rate of 2.8%, which are among the lowest in the world. Also, the severity of the disease is much less among Indians as evidenced by the low rate of ICU admission (15.3%) and the need for mechanical ventilation (4.16%). As per the World Health Organization (WHO) situation report 165 on July 3, 2020, India has one of the lowest deaths per 100,000 population (1.32 deaths against a global average of 6.04). Several factors related to the pathogen, host and environment might have some role in reducing the susceptibility of Indians to COVID-19. These include some ongoing mutations that can alter the virulence of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, host factors like innate immunity, genetic diversity in immune responses, epigenetic factors, genetic polymorphisms of ACE2 receptors, micro RNAs and universal BCG vaccination, and environmental factors like high temperature and humidity which may alter the viability and transmissibility of the strain. This perspective -highlights the potential factors that might be responsible for the observed low COVID-19 fatality rate in Indian population. It puts forward several hypotheses which can be a ground for future studies determining individual and population susceptibility to COVID-19 and thus, may offer a new dimension to our current understanding of the disease.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Through Peripheral Nerves Explains Multiple Organ Injury. Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19), caused by recently identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by inconsistent clinical presentations. While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.

0	A Review of Multi-Compartment Infectious Disease Models. Multi-compartment models have been playing a central role in modelling infectious disease dynamics since the early 20th century. They are a class of mathematical models widely used for describing the mechanism of an evolving epidemic. Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. r software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper. Copyright © 2020 International Statistical Institute.	false
0	Protocol: Leveraging a demographic and health surveillance system for Covid-19 Surveillance in rural KwaZulu-Natal. A coordinated system of disease surveillance will be critical to effectively control the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.

0	Logistic equation and COVID-19. The generalized logistic equation is used to interpret the COVID-19 epidemic data in several countries: Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and South Korea. The model coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus incidence. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Social and electronic media exposure and generalized anxiety disorder among people during COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh: A preliminary observation. Classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has spread to Bangladesh since early March of 2020, and people are getting daily updates from the social and electronic media. We aimed at assessing the prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi people during the pandemic in connection with social media exposure (SME) and electronic media exposure (EME). For this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 880 participants by a self-administered online-based questionnaire relating personal characteristics, self-rate health (SRH), SME, and EME with anxiety. Findings show that around half of the surveyed population experienced a spike of anxiety (49.1%) during the pandemic, ten times higher than the national anxiety rate in 2019. The participants with an increased SME of over four hours per day experienced a higher level of anxiety than individuals with < = 2 hours exposure to social media. Similarly, the anxiety was higher among people with fair/bad SRH compared to individuals with excellent SRH. It is highly recommended to develop active surveillance and effective monitoring systems to reduce the spread of misinformation from both social and electronic media to improve the state of mental health conditions during the pandemic.	false
0	Absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats and dogs in close contact with a cluster of COVID-19 patients in a veterinary campus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, in 2019, is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now accepted that the wild fauna, probably bats, constitute the initial reservoir of the virus, but little is known about the role pets can play in the spread of the disease in human communities, knowing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect some domestic animals. In this cross-sectional study, we tested the antibody response in a cluster of 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close contact with their owners (belonging to a veterinary community of 20 students) in which two students tested positive for COVID-19 and several others (n = 11/18) consecutively showed clinical signs (fever, cough, anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood one month after the index case was reported, using an immunoprecipitation assay. These original data can serve a better evaluation of the host range of SARS-CoV-2 in natural environment exposure conditions. Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Prevalence and Social Determinants of Food Insecurity among College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has increased unemployment and food insecurity in the United States (US). Prior to the pandemic, college students exhibited higher rates of food insecurity than nonstudent households. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence and determinants of food insecurity among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered an online survey to 651 students on three diverse campuses at a state-funded university in Texas, US, in May 2020. Food security was assessed using a multistep approach that included the 2-item Food Sufficiency Screener and 6-Item USDA Food Security Survey Module (FSSM). Overall, 34.5% of respondents were classified as food insecure within the last 30 days. The strongest predictors of food insecurity were change in current living arrangement (OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 2.47, 2.95), being furloughed (OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 2.86, 3.64), laid off (OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 3.55, 4.66), or losing part-time work (OR = 5.73, 95% CI: 5.09, 6.46) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the high prevalence of food insecurity among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with students who experienced housing insecurity and/or loss of income due to the pandemic being impacted the most.	false
0	[Investigation on two family clusters of COVID-19 in a county of Baotou city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]. Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and transmission chain of COVID-19 in two families, and to provide scientific evidence for effective prevention and control measures. Methods: Field epidemiological investigation was conducted for the COVID-19 cases occurred in two families and the close contacts in a county of Baotou city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Descriptive statistical analysis on epidemiological data was conducted. Results: The infection source of the COVID-19 cases in the two families was a man who had living history in Wuhan. After his return, his parents were infected by him. A few days later, the members of a neighbor family were found to be infected, and relatives of this family were also infected after dining together repeatedly. Finally, ten confirmed cases and three suspected cases of COVID-19 were detected in the two families. Conclusions: Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur not only in a family but also in neighborhoods. The cases in two families had close relationship, indicating the necessity to strengthen the health education about COVID-19 prevention and control and the management of groups at high risk to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in families and neighborhoods.	false
0	Correlation of the two most frequent HLA haplotypes in the Italian population to the differential regional incidence of Covid-19. BACKGROUND: Understanding how HLA polymorphisms may affect both susceptibility, course and severity of Covid-19 infection could help both at the clinical level to identify individuals at higher risk from the disease and at the epidemiological one to explain the differences in the epidemic trend among countries or even within a specific country. Covid-19 disease in Italy showed a peculiar geographical distribution from the northern most affected regions to the southern ones only slightly touched. METHOD(S): In this study we analysed the regional frequencies for the most common Italian haplotypes from the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at four-digit level). Then we performed Pearson correlation analyses among regional haplotypes estimated frequency in the population and Covid-19 incidence and mortality. RESULT(S): In this study we found that the two most frequent HLA haplotypes in the Italian population, HLA-A*:01:01g-B*08:01 g-C*07:01g-DRB1*03:01g and HLA-A*02.01g-B*18.01g-C*07.01g-DRB1*11.04g, had a regional distribution overlapping that of Covid-19 and showed respectively a positive (suggestive of susceptibility) and negative (suggestive of protection) significant correlation with both Covid-19 incidence and mortality. CONCLUSION(S): Based on these results, in order to define such HLA haplotypes as a factor effectively associated to the disease susceptibility, the creation of national networks that can collect patients' samples from all regions for HLA typing should be highly encouraged.	false
0	Serological Assays Estimate Highly Variable SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Activity in Recovered COVID19 Patients. The development of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against SARS-CoV-2, following infection or vaccination, is likely to be critical for the development of sufficient population immunity to drive cessation of the COVID19 pandemic. A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, tests have substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of nAb is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated serological measurements with nAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting nAb activity. We found the Ortho Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig and IgG high throughput serological assays (HTSAs), as well as the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with nAb assays and are consistent with gold-standard ELISA assay results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to nAb activity and could serve as a valuable 'roadmap' to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Luchsinger et al.	false
0	Receptor-binding domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, have posed severe threats to global public health and the economy. Treatment and prevention of these viral diseases call for the research and development of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs). Scientists have screened neutralizing antibodies using the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an antigen, indicating that RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses. This review summarizes the structure and function of RBD and RBD-specific NMAbs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 currently under development.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Nailfold capillaroscopy findings in patients with coronavirus disease 19: Broadening the spectrum of covid-19 microvascular involvement. OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence points to endothelial dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). No specific methods have been identified to predict, detect and quantify the microvascular alterations during COVID-19. Our aim was to assess microvasculature through nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): We performed NVC in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Elementary alterations were reported for each finger according to a semi-quantitative score. Capillary density, number of enlarged and giant capillaries, number of micro-hemorrhages and micro-thrombosis (NEMO score) were registered. RESULT(S): We enrolled 82 patients (mean age 58.8+/-13.2years, male 68.3%) of whom 28 during the hospitalization and 54 after recovery and hospital discharge. At NVC examination we found abnormalities classifiable as non-specific pattern in 53 patients (64.6%). Common abnormalities were pericapillary edema (80.5%), enlarged capillaries (61.0%), sludge flow (53.7%), meandering capillaries and reduced capillary density (50.0%). No pictures suggestive of scleroderma pattern have been observed. Acute COVID-19 patients, compared to recovered patients, showed a higher prevalence of hemosiderin deposits as a result of micro-hemorrhages (P=.027) and micro-thrombosis (P<.016), sludge flow (P=.001), and pericapillary edema (P<.001), while recovered patients showed a higher prevalence of enlarged capillaries (P<.001), loss of capillaries (P=.002), meandering capillaries (P<.001), and empty dermal papillae (P=.006). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 patients present microvascular abnormalities at NVC. Currently ill and recovered subjects are characterized by a different distribution of elementary capillaroscopic alterations, resembling acute and post-acute microvascular damage. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of NVC in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Efficacy of convalescent plasma according to blood groups in COVID-19 patients. Aim In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) according to blood groups (BGs) in the treatment of critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Material(s) and Method(s): 28 critically ill and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Sakarya University, Medical Faculty were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups as anti-A Antibody (Ab) containing (BG O and B) and those not containing anti-A Ab (BG A and AB) CP received patients. Result(s): Among 28 patients, 13 patients received anti-A Ab containing CP (BG; B: 6, O: 7), 15 patients not containing anti-A Ab CP (BG; A: 13, AB: 2). Duration in ICU, the rates of mechanical ventilation (MV) support and vasopressor support, the case fatality rate and discharge rate were lower in patients received CP containing anti-A Ab than not containing anti-A Ab CP. However, only the difference in the rate of MV support achieved statistically significance (p=0.04) Conclusion(s): In our study, it was observed that the efficiency of CP without anti-A antibody was lower than that of plasma containing anti-A antibody, although it was not statistically significant. This result is thought to be due to the anti-A antibody's ability to block the ACE2 receptor. We believe that this hypothesis should be investigated in controlled studies with higher patient numbers.	false
0	Clinical features and outcomes of thoracic surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to describe the clinical features and outcomes of thoracic surgery patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHOD(S): Thirty-five patients were treated at the 12 de Octubre University Hospital in Madrid between 1 March 2020 and 24 April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient demographics, surgical procedures, complications, COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes were recorded. A protocol was introduced to reduce the risk of operating on patients with COVID-19, including symptom screening, a polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and computed tomography scans of the chest. Surgical activity changed significantly during this time, from an initial period of near-normal activity, through an emergency-only period and finally a recovery period when some oncological surgical cases were restarted. Selection criteria for surgical patients are also described. RESULT(S): A total of 34 patients underwent surgery during the pandemic period. We performed 22 lung resections (11 lobectomies and 11 sublobar resections). No hospital deaths were recorded. An elective surgery patient and an emergency surgery patient were diagnosed with COVID-19 (5.88%). The former died within 30days after surgery. CONCLUSION(S): Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 represents a tremendous limitation for thoracic surgical practice. Preoperative practices to exclude asymptomatic cases infected with the virus allowed us to perform thoracic surgical procedures.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	COVID-19 associated kidney impairment in adult: Qualitative and quantitative analyses with non-enhanced CT on admission. Purpose: To qualitatively and quantitatively assess kidney imapairment in adults with COVID-19 by analysing imaging features on non-enhanced CT (NECT) and possible correlation between renal parenchymal attenuation (RPA) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels on admission. Method(s): This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. A total of 82 patients with COVID-19 admitted from 10/1/2020~15/3/2020 were enrolled. RPA and perinephric fat stranding (PFS) were evaluated on NECT imaging. According to the presence of PFS, the patients were divided into two groups: Group A, 38 patients with PFS, and Group B, 44 patients without PFS. Clinical data, including age, gender, clinical classification, SCr levels, and RPA on NECT were analysed. The RPA and SCr of the two groups with COVID-19 were analysed to determine possible difference and correlation. Eighty subjects with no kidney diseases were randomly selected as control group to determine the RPA of normal kidney performed on the same CT scanner. Result(s): Mean age, male to female ratio, number of severe and critical cases, and SCr of Group A were higher than those of Group B. Both mean RPA of Group A and Group B were lower than that of control. Mean RPA of Group A was even lower than that of Group B. A significant weak negative linear correlation between RPA on NECT and SCr in COVID-19 was indicated. Conclusion(s): Decrease in RPA on NECT was observed in patients with COVID-19 and a weak linear negative correlation with SCr levels was found. The presence of PFS suggested more severe renal impairment in COVID-19. RPA measurements and PFS could be useful in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COVID-19 associated renal impairment on admission.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection: a rapid review. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. Objective(s): We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. Search Method(s): An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. Selection Criteria: Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown. Data Collection and Analysis: After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. Main Result(s): We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening. We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy. All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. Authors' conclusions: The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

0	Immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients including young infants. Pediatric cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are generally mild or asymptomatic, and are usually detected by virological examination following close contact with COVID-19 patients, often the children's parents. The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric COVID-19 patients, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of 4 children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.

0	Analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for SARS-CoV-2 IgG using two commercial immunoassays. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) was approved by the FDA for use in severe cases of COVID-19 under an emergency Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol. Eligibility criteria for CCP donors includes documentation of evidence of COVID-19 either by viral RNA detection at the time of illness or positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG after recovery if diagnostic testing for COVID-19 was not performed at the time of illness. In addition to analysis of CCP, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgG provides information for possible past exposure and may support diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 PCR is negative and clinical suspicion for COVID-19 is high. Furthermore, assays with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG are critical for understanding community exposure rates to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there are several assays that test for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a variety of methods, including point-of-care lateral flow-based devices, high throughput immunoassay analyzers, and manual methods such as ELISA. These assays target a number of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein (N), full length spike protein (S), S1 subunit, or receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Given the heterogeneity among methods for, and antigenic targets used in SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, it is necessary for careful evaluation of these assays prior to implementation for clinical use. We compared two assays that had received the CE mark of regulatory approval and that used either the N antigen or S1-RBD antigen as the target for analysis of a large set of CCP samples. Our data indicates that sensitivity and specificity vary between these assays and that more than one antigenic target may be required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of IgG detection to SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Virtual raves and happy hours during COVID-19: New drug use contexts for electronic dance music partygoers. Background: The popularity of virtual raves and happy hours has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. While nightlife settings are often associated with drug use, it is unknown whether virtual events are associated with use. Method(s): Electronic dance music (EDM) partygoers who live in New York and reported recent drug use were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. Eligible adults (n = 128) were asked about virtual rave and happy hour attendance during the COVID-19 crisis. We examined prevalence and correlates of drug use during such events. Result(s): 55.5% of participants attended virtual raves and 69.5% attended virtual happy hours. 40.9% used illegal drugs during virtual raves and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.6%), ecstasy/MDMA/Molly (8.5%), LSD (7.0%), and cocaine (4.2%). 33.7% used illegal drugs during virtual happy hours and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.2%), cocaine (3.4%), and ketamine (3.4%). Older participants were more likely to use illegal drugs during virtual raves, and those reporting past-year use of more drugs were more likely to use drugs during virtual raves and/or happy hours (ps<0.05). Conclusion(s): EDM partygoers are at risk for using drugs during virtual events. Results can inform prevention and harm reduction efforts.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Venous thromboembolism in the era of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) does not only affect the respiratory system but appears to be a systemic disease. Venous thromboembolism is a common manifestation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a reported incidence that is significantly higher compared to other acute viral infections. The pathophysiology mechanisms have not been fully explored and autopsy studies might enhance our understanding on this topic. Microthrombi formation occurs mainly in the pulmonary vasculature but can also occur in other organs. The high inflammatory burden related to COVID-19 seems to be associated with the coexisting coagulopathy. Concomitant manifestations of COVID-19, such as severe pneumonia, which has similar clinical presentation with pulmonary embolism (PE), and barriers related to strict isolation protocols are the two main reasons why PE diagnosis might be more challenging in patients with COVID-19. Medical societies have published guidance reports suggesting the administration of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but several questions regarding the optimal acute and long-term treatment of these patients remain unanswered.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	The COVID-19 pandemic in italy: Policy and technology impact on health and non-health outcomes. Background: Italy was the first Western country to experience a major coronavirus outbreak and consequently faced large-scale health and socio-economic challenges. The Italian government enforced a wide set of homogeneous interventions nationally, despite the differing incidences of the virus throughout the country. Objective(s): The paper aims to analyse the policies implemented by the government and their impact on health and non-health outcomes considering both scaling-up and scaling-down interventions. Method(s): To categorise the policy interventions, we rely on the comparative and conceptual framework developed by Moy et al. (2020). We investigate the impact of policies on the daily reported number of deaths, case fatality rate, confirmation rate, intensive care unit saturation, and financial and job market indicators across the three major geographical areas of Italy (North, Centre, and South). Qualitative and quantitative data are gathered from mixed sources: Italian national and regional institutions, National Health Research and international organisations. Our analysis contributes to the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing policy interventions and their outcomes. Result(s): Our findings suggest that the strictness and timing of containment and prevention measures played a prominent role in tackling the pandemic, both from a health and economic perspective. Technological interventions played a marginal role due to the inadequacy of protocols and the delay of their implementation. Conclusion(s): Future government interventions should be informed by evidence-based decision making to balance, the benefits arising from the timing and stringency of the interventions against the adverse social and economic cost, both in the short and long term.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients: an international registry study. Background: Despite concerns that patients with liver transplants might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 because of coexisting comorbidities and use of immunosuppressants, the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on this patient group remains unclear. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients. Method(s): In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death. Finding(s): Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0.106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0.837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<0.0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<0.0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0.046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1.4% [95% CI -7.7 to 10.4]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1.57 [1.05 to 2.36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18.30 [1.96 to 170.75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. Interpretation(s): Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Oral manifestations in a patient with a history of asymptomatic COVID-19. Case Report. The pandemic situation has led to public health measures that have forced patients with and without the SARS-CoV-2 virus to remain isolated and take steps to prevent the spread. Many of these patients have been unable to attend the control of medical-dental services, which in many cases complicates their situation. This study reports on the oral manifestations of an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient treated interdisciplinary by teleconsultation due to the sudden appearance of lesions in the oral mucosa. Lesions are diagnosed, therapeutic measures are taken, and improvement is shown. This case shows that the problems that arise in the oral mucosa in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection can be monitored through interdisciplinary teleconsultation during the pandemic with the support of information technology currently available worldwide. It also decreases the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 between patients and health professionals.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Assessment of extra-parenchymal lung involvement in asymptomatic cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia detected on 18F-FDG PET-CT studies. Background: Lung involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing PET-CT has been previously reported. However, FDG uptake outside lung parenchyma was poorly characterized in detail. We evaluated the extra-parenchymal lung involvement in asymptomatic cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia through 18F-FDG PET-CT. Method(s): A total of 1079 oncologic 18F-FDG PET-CT were performed between February 2 and May 18, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as characteristic ground-glass bilateral CT infiltrates and positive genetic/serologic tests. Nonmetastatic extra-parenchymal lung PET-CT findings were evaluated through qualitative (visual), quantitative (measurements on CT), and semiquantitative (maximum standardized uptake value: SUVmax on PET) interpretation. Clinical data, blood tests, and PET-CT results were compared between patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Result(s): A total of 23 18F-FDG PET-CT scans with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 and available laboratory data were included: 14 positive (cases) and 9 negative (controls) for COVID-19 infection, representing a low prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia (1.3%). Serum lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimers tended to be increased in COVID-19 cases. Extra-parenchymal lung findings were found in 42.9% of patients with COVID-19, most frequently as mediastinal and hilar nodes with 18F-FDG uptake (35.7%), followed by incidental pulmonary embolism in two patients (14.3%). In the control group, extra-pulmonary findings were observed in a single patient (11.1%) with 18F-FDG uptake located to mediastinal, hilar, and cervical nodes. Nasopharyngeal and hepatic SUVmax were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): In cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia, 18F-FDG PET-CT findings are more frequently limited to thoracic structures, suggesting that an early and silent distant involvement is very rare. Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially severe finding raising special concern. PET-CT can provide new pathogenic insights about this novel disease.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Disruption of Adaptive Immunity Enhances Disease in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Syrian Hamsters. Animal models recapitulating human COVID-19 disease, especially with severe disease, are urgently needed to understand pathogenesis and evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection. Our results suggest that functional B and/or T cells are not only important for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, but also play an early role in protection from acute disease.IMPORTANCE Syrian hamsters are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Pathology is pronounced in the upper and lower respiratory tract and disease signs and endpoints include weight loss, viral RNA and/or infectious virus in swabs and organs (e.g. lungs). However, a high dose of virus is needed to produce disease and the disease resolves rapidly. Here, we demonstrate that immunosuppressed hamsters are susceptible to low doses of virus and develop more severe and prolonged disease. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody using the cyclophosphamide transient suppression model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAG2 knockout hamsters develop severe/fatal disease when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. These immunosuppressed hamster models provide researchers new tools for evaluating therapies and vaccines, and understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis.	false
0	International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): Cemetery planning, preparation and management during COVID-19: A quick guide to proper documentation and disposition of the dead. Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders in some of its operational contexts to advise on the planning, preparation and management of cemeteries during COVID19. The management of the dead process includes proper documentation and appropriate disposition, including temporary burials. If there is a sudden and significant increase in the number of deaths, local capacities can quickly become overwhelmed. This guidance, prepared for the COVID19 pandemic, can be applied to any incident involving mass fatalities when the local capacity to provide safe, appropriate and dignified burials is overwhelmed. Specifications on size, spacing, excavation depths, and information about other important considerations are provided. In addition, it provides recommendations on how to correctly map graves while ensuring the traceability and correct management of bodies in a cemetery. Procedures for receiving bodies, as well as measures to ensure the health and safety of relatives and cemetery staff are also covered in this guidance.Copyright © 2020.

0	Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety, Distress and Insomnia and Related Factors in Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia and related factors in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. We applied the study survey online to HCWs during the pandemic in Turkey between 23 April and 23 May 2020. We used the sociodemographic data form, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Six hundred twenty (66.0%) of the 939 HCWs taking part in the study were female, 580 (61.8%) were physicians, 569 (60.6%) were working on the front line. Seven hundred twenty-nine (77.6%) participants exhibited depression, 565 (60.2%) anxiety, 473 (50.4%) insomnia, and 717 (76.4%) distress symptoms. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress symptoms were significantly greater among females, individuals with a history of psychiatric illness, and individuals receiving psychiatric support during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs serving in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress symptoms. Female gender, being a nurse, working on the front line, history of psychiatric illness, and being tested for COVID-19 were identified as risk factors for mental health problems.	false
0	Environmental and Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. During April and May 2020, we studied 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, their hospital rooms (fomites and aerosols), and their close contacts for molecular and culture evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among the more than 400 samples, we found molecular evidence of virus in most sample types, especially the nasopharygeal (NP), saliva, and fecal samples, but the prevalence of molecular positivity among fomites and aerosols was low. The agreement between NP swab and saliva positivity was high (89.5%, Kappa 0.79). Two NP swabs collected from patients on one and seven days post-symptom onset had evidence of infectious virus (2 passages over 14 days in Vero E6 cells). In summary, the low molecular prevalence and lack of viable SARS-CoV-2 virus in fomites and air samples implied low nosocomial risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission through inanimate objects or aerosols.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Restrictions on going out, meeting other people, and participating in activities during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic may have a prolonged effect on older people. This article discusses the importance of social relationships in the health of older people based on the results of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) that has conducted nationwide longitudinal studies. We selected cohort studies of JAGES, which investigated the relationships between social relationships and health, with more than 10000 participants and published after 2010. The results showed that having contact with others, eating with others, and participating in social activities were negatively related to incident dementia, functional disability, depression, and premature death. A minimum of weekly contact with others, eating with others, and social participation by maintaining physical distancing are needed, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. For reducing the risks of transmission of coronavirus and its negative effects on health in the future, using the internet may be beneficial. The development of technological support networks for older people may be necessary."	false
0	Incidence of anxiety in epilepsy during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people globally, and people with chronic diseases are suffering more in maintaining their mental and physical health. Method(s): This cross-sectional, case-control study assessed the anxiety level in people with epilepsy compared with the general population. Result(s): The results showed that 13.5% of patients had experienced a severe level of anxiety, but the mean anxiety level between groups did not show significant difference. Conclusion(s): Although still many aspects of the pandemic on people with epilepsy are yet to be determined, active investigation of psychological sequels of the pandemic is demanded.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Social Disadvantage, Politics, and SARS-CoV-2 Trends: A County-Level Analysis of United States Data. BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for public health control efforts. Social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with changes in SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective analysis of the relationship between the change in reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county. RESULT(S): 1023/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66.3%) had increasing, and 345 (33.7%) had non-increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In bivariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had significantly higher Social Deprivation Index (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0.009). Counties with increasing case counts were significantly more likely to be metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population (p&0.001), to have a higher percentage of Black residents (9% vs. 6%, p=0.013), and to have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2016 by a 10-point or greater margin (p=0.044). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts. CONCLUSION(S): Increasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US during June 2020 were associated with a combination of sociodemographic and political factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will play a critical role in pandemic control.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	The clinical sensitivity of a single SARS-CoV-2 upper respiratory tract RT-PCR test for diagnosing COVID-19 using convalescent antibody as a comparator. The clinical false negative rate of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 on a single upper respiratory tract sample was calculated using convalescent antibody testing as a comparator. The sensitivity in symptomatic individuals was 86.2% (25/29). Of the missed cases, one (3.5%) was detected by repeat RT-PCR, one by CT thorax and two (7.1%) by convalescent antibody. The clinical false negative rate of a single RT-PCR on an upper respiratory tract sample of 14% in symptomatic patients is reassuring when compared to early reports. This report supports a strategy of combining repeat swabbing, use of acute and convalescent antibody testing and CT thorax for COVID-19 diagnosis.Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	Clinical course and risk factors for recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA: a retrospective cohort study from Wuhan, China. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study was to determine the clinical course and risk factors for patients showing recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. A total of 1087 COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Advanced age was significantly associated with mortality. In addition, 81 (7.6%) of the discharged patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the isolation period. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to recurrence was 50 days. Multivariate regression analysis identified elevated serum IL-6, increased lymphocyte counts and CT imaging features of lung consolidation during hospitalization as the independent risk factors of recurrence. We hypothesized that the balance between immune response and virus toxicity may be the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. For patients with a high risk of recurrence, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.	false
0	Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 is present in currently available intravenous immunoglobulins. Background: Cross-reactivity against human coronaviruses with Flebogamma DIF and Gamunex-C, two available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), has been reported. In this study, these IVIG were tested for neutralization activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Material(s) and Method(s): Neutralization capacity of lots of IVIG manufactured prior to COVID-19 pandemic was assessed against these viruses in cell culture. Infectivity neutralization was quantified by percent reduction in plaque-forming units and/or cytopathic/cytotoxic methods. Result(s): All IVIG preparations showed neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Conclusion(s): The tested IVIG contain antibodies with significant in vitro cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but not MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently under evaluation as potential therapies for COVID-19.	false
0	Severe hyperphosphatasemia and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children. : It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 infection because of coronavirus is highly contagious and caused varying degrees of illness throughout the world. Hepatic dysfunction and the slight elevation of liver enzymes have been reported in cases of COVID-19 infection. Transient hyperphosphatasemia is a benign condition characterized by the elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and the return to normal levels within weeks or months of first observation. We reported the first infant case of severe hyperphosphatasemia because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a 9-month-old child admitted to the Pediatric Covid-19 Unit of Amiens University Hospital. Given the hepatic tropism and COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory reactions, our case suggests that, an isolated severe hyperphosphatasemia in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection should increase the possibility of transient hyperphosphatasemia, even if is also demonstrated a classic natural history of the transient hyperphosphatasemia during viral infection, especially in SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Covid-19 and the role of smoking: the protocol of the multicentric prospective study COSMO-IT (COvid19 and SMOking in ITaly). The emergency caused by Covid-19 pandemic raised interest in studying lifestyles and comorbidities as important determinants of poor Covid-19 prognosis. Data on tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity are still limited, while no data are available on the role of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTP). To clarify the role of tobacco smoking and other lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity and progression, we designed a longitudinal observational study titled COvid19 and SMOking in ITaly (COSMO-IT). About 30 Italian hospitals in North, Centre and South of Italy joined the study. Its main aims are: 1) to quantify the role of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation on the severity and progression of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients; 2) to compare smoking prevalence and severity of the disease in relation to smoking in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus patients treated at home; 3) to quantify the association between other lifestyle factors, such as e-cigarette and HTP use, alcohol and obesity and the risk of unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical history information will be gathered for around 3000 hospitalized and 700-1000 home-isolated, laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19 patients. Given the current absence of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2 and the lack of a specific treatment for -COVID-19, prevention strategies are of extreme importance. This project, designed to highly contribute to the international scientific debate on the role of avoidable lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity, will provide valuable epidemiological data in order to support important recommendations to prevent COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.	false
0	"A review of studies on the epidemic crisis of COVID-19 disease with a preventive approach. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious acute respiratory syndrome and has been declared a pandemic in more than 209 countries worldwide. At the time of writing, no preventive vaccine has been developed and tested in the community. This study was conducted to review studies aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus worldwide. METHOD(S): This study was a review of the evidence-based literature and was conducted by searching databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, until April 2020. The search was performed based on keywords including ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", and ""prevention"". The list of references in the final studies has also been re-reviewed to find articles that might not have been obtained through the search. The guidelines published by trustworthy organizations such as the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control have been used in this study. CONCLUSION(S): So far, no vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19 has been invented, and the disease has become a pandemic. Therefore, observation of hand hygiene, disinfection of high-touch surfaces, observation of social distance, and lack of presence in public places are recommended as preventive measures. Moreover, to control the situation and to reduce the incidence of the virus, some of the measures taken by the decision-making bodies and the guidelines of the deterrent institutions to strengthen telecommuting of employees and reduce the presence of people in the community and prevent unnecessary activities, are very important."	false
0	Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of primate cardiopulmonary aging. Aging is a major risk factor for many diseases, especially in highly prevalent cardiopulmonary comorbidities and infectious diseases including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Resolving cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with aging in higher mammals is therefore urgently needed. Here, we created young and old non-human primate single-nucleus/cell transcriptomic atlases of lung, heart and artery, the top tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of cell type-specific aging-associated transcriptional changes revealed increased systemic inflammation and compromised virus defense as a hallmark of cardiopulmonary aging. With age, expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was increased in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial barrier, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. We found that interleukin 7 (IL7) accumulated in aged cardiopulmonary tissues and induced ACE2 expression in human vascular endothelial cells in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with vitamin C blocked IL7-induced ACE2 expression. Altogether, our findings depict the first transcriptomic atlas of the aged primate cardiopulmonary system and provide vital insights into age-linked susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that geroprotective strategies may reduce COVID-19 severity in the elderly.	false
0	Chest computed tomography findings in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Background: Little is known about the damage to the respiratory system in asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective(s): Herein, we evaluate the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. Method(s): We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Result(s): In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.Copyright © 2020 S.

0	Designing and Interpreting COVID-19 Diagnostics: Mathematics, Visual Logistics, and Low Prevalence. CONTEXT: Coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) diagnostics require understanding of how predictive values depend on sensitivity, specificity, and especially, low prevalence. Clear expectations, high sensitivity and specificity, and manufacturer disclosure will facilitate excellence of tests. OBJECTIVE(S): To derive mathematical equations for designing and interpreting COVID-19 tests, assess Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization and Health Canada minimum requirements, establish sensitivity and specificity tiers, and enhance clinical performance in low prevalence settings. DESIGN: PubMed and other sources generated articles on COVID-19 testing and prevalence. EndNote X9.1 consolidated references. Mathematica and open access software helped prove equations, perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize patterns, including a new relationship, predictive value geometric mean-squared. RESULT(S): Derived equations were used to illustrate shortcomings of COVID-19 diagnostics in low prevalence. Visual logistics helped establish sensitivity/specificity tiers. FDA/Canada's 90% sensitivity, 95% specificity minimum requirements generate excessive false positives at low prevalence. False positives exceed true positives at <5.3% prevalence, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at <2% prevalence. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. CONCLUSION(S): Understanding low prevalence impact will help healthcare providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing. Laypersons should receive clinical performance disclosure when submitting specimens. Home testing needs to meet the same high standards as other tests. In the long run, it will be more cost-effective to improve COVID-19 POC tests rather than repeat testing multiple times.Copyright © 2020 College of American Pathologists.	false
0	An Online Influenza Surveillance System for Primary Care Workers in Switzerland: Observational Prospective Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the influenza epidemiology among primary care workers could guide future recommendations to prevent transmission in primary care practices. Therefore, we designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using a work-based online influenza surveillance system among primary care workers. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as its findings could apply to other infectious diseases with similar mechanisms of transmission., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of using a work-based online influenza surveillance system for primary care workers in Switzerland., METHODS: Physicians and staff of one walk-in clinic and two selected primary care practices were enrolled in this observational prospective pilot study during the 2017-2018 influenza season. They were invited to record symptoms of influenza-like illness in a weekly online survey sent by email and to self-collect a nasopharyngeal swab in case any symptoms were recorded. Samples were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for influenza A, influenza B, and a panel of respiratory pathogens., RESULTS: Among 67 eligible staff members, 58% (n=39) consented to the study and 53% (n=36) provided data. From the time all participants were included, the weekly survey response rate stayed close to 100% until the end of the study. Of 79 symptomatic episodes (mean 2.2 episodes per participant), 10 episodes in 7 participants fitted the definition of an influenza-like illness case (attack rate: 7/36, 19%). One swab tested positive for influenza A H1N1 (attack rate: 3%, 95% CI 0%-18%). Swabbing was considered relatively easy., CONCLUSIONS: A work-based online influenza surveillance system is feasible for use among primary care workers. This promising methodology could be broadly used in future studies to improve the understanding of influenza epidemiology and other diseases such as COVID-19. This could prove to be highly useful in primary care settings and guide future recommendations to prevent transmission. A larger study will also help to assess asymptomatic infections.

0	A network-based explanation of why most COVID-19 infection curves are linear. Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of nonpharmaceutical interventions pushing the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this phase of the pandemic many countries showed an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where either infection numbers grow explosively until herd immunity is reached or the epidemic is completely suppressed. Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, [Formula: see text], below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above [Formula: see text] traditional epidemiological dynamics take place, e.g., as in susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. When calibrating our model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find [Formula: see text] Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular, we compare the United States and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.

0	In Vitro Virucidal Effect of Intranasally Delivered Chlorpheniramine Maleate Compound Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Background The initial global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic, which is responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and behaves similarly to influenza with a high intranasal viral load. The genome sequence of COVID-19 opened the opportunity for multiple in vitro and clinical trials, but we still do not have a clear path to treatment. Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is a safe and effective antihistamine with potent antiviral activity against various strains of influenza A/B, thus suggesting that CPM has broad antiviral activity. We tested the virucidal potential of CPM in a nasal spray composition currently in development as an anti-allergy medication. Methods The virucidal activity of CPM was tested using viral stock of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain in Vero 76 infected cells. The endpoint titer 50% cell culture infection dose (CCID50) values were calculated using the Reed-Muench (1948) equation. Three independent replicates of each sample were tested, and the average and standard deviation were calculated. Results were compared with untreated controls using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Dunnett's multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism (version 8) software. Results After 25 minutes of contact time, the nasal spray reduced the levels of the virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant 2.5 log reduction value or 99.7% reduction in the viral load. Conclusions This study demonstrates the strong virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a nasal spray containing CPM. Given that CPM has broad antiviral effects against influenza and virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2, we propose two further studies: a randomized placebo-controlled study of intranasally delivered chlorpheniramine in patients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 and a second study aiming to determine the potential antiviral and adjuvant effects of CPM plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2.

0	Probability of COVID-19 Being the Culprit in Neurocognitive Deception: A Case Series of Incidental Strokes in ICU Patients With COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, originated in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, infecting millions and killing thousands. Although some patients have mild or even asymptomatic responses to this infection, hospitalized patients present with symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Some patients have a severe response to the insult and experience rapid progression to acute respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. Furthermore, many patients developed complications due to this infection. Here, we present three patients who had strokes during their hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia.

0	42 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 of the ordinary type with the adjuvant treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion 42. Objective: To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of adjuvant treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) of the ordinary type., Methods: A total of 42 patients with COVID-19 of the ordinary type were adopted. Shenque ( CV8) and Tianshu ( ST25) were selected. Heat-sensitive moxibustion was operated according to the required standard, 40 min to 60 min each time, once daily. Before and after moxibustion, the improvements in clinical symptoms were evaluated, such as chest oppression, poor appetite, lassitude and negative emotions., Results: (1) The number of cases and the incidence was 21 cases (50.0%), 24 cases (57.1%) and 26 cases (61.9%) for chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude before heat-sensitive moxibustion. The number of cases was reduced to be 10 cases (23.8%), 7 cases (16.7%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 1st treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion for chest oppression, poor appetite, and lassitude. It was reduced to be 11 cases (26.2%), 8 cases (19.0%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 2nd treatment of moxibustion and it was reduced to be 18 cases (42.9%), 10 cases (23.8%) and 6 cases (14.3%) after the 3rd treatment of moxibustion. The incidences of the symptoms were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (2) Before treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion, there were 24 cases of negative emotions (57.1%). It was reduced to be 16 cases (38.1%), 11 cases (26.2%) and 3 cases (7.1%) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion successively. The incidences were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (3) After the 1st treatment, the active acceptance rate of heat-sensitive moxibustion was 100% (42/42) in the patients, higher than 11.9% (5/42) before treatment., Conclusion: Adjuvant treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion effectively relieves the symptoms of COVID-19 such as chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude, and alleviates the negative emotions, such as tension and anxiety. This therapy improves the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 and deserves to be promoted in clinical practice.

0	Potential impact on coagulopathy of gene variants of coagulation related proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2. Thrombosis has been one of the complications of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches., Author summary: Increased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 in fruit bats, ferrets, pigs, and chickens: an experimental transmission study. Background: In December, 2019, a novel zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus emerged in China. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became pandemic within weeks and the number of human infections and severe cases is increasing. We aimed to investigate the susceptibilty of potential animal hosts and the risk of anthropozoonotic spill-over infections., Methods: We intranasally inoculated nine fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets (Mustela putorius), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), and 17 chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) with 105 TCID50 of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate per animal. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included 24 h after inoculation to test viral transmission. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and for virus shedding by nucleic acid extraction from nasal washes and rectal swabs (ferrets), oral swabs and pooled faeces samples (fruit bats), nasal and rectal swabs (pigs), or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (chickens) on days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 after infection by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). On days 4, 8, and 12, two inoculated animals (or three in the case of chickens) of each species were euthanised, and all remaining animals, including the contacts, were euthanised at day 21. All animals were subjected to autopsy and various tissues were collected for virus detection by RT-qPCR, histopathology immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralisation test in samples collected before inoculation and at autopsy., Findings: Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for viral RNA, and none of the pigs or chickens seroconverted. Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung, and lung-associated lymphatic tissue in two animals euthanised at day 4. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets, with transmission to all three direct contact animals. Mild rhinitis was associated with viral antigen detection in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Prominent viral RNA loads of 0-104 viral genome copies per mL were detected in the upper respiratory tract of fruit bats and ferrets, and both species developed SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies reaching neutralising titres of up to 1/1024 after 21 days., Interpretation: Pigs and chickens could not be infected intranasally by SARS-CoV-2, whereas fruit bats showed characteristics of a reservoir host. Virus replication in ferrets resembled a subclinical human infection with efficient spread. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for further studies-eg, testing vaccines or antivirals., Funding: German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Incidence of thromboembolic disease is reported to be high in SARS-CoV2 disease and is seen in a multitude of organ systems ranging from cutaneous thrombosis to pulmonary embolism, stroke or coronary thrombosis sometimes with catastrophic outcomes. Evidence points towards a key role of thromboembolism, hypercoagulability and over production of proinflammatory cytokines mimicking a ""cytokine storm"" which leads to multiorgan failure. This brief narrative review highlights the pathophysiology and risk factors of thromboembolic disease and provides a framework for management of anticoagulation based on the current evidence.

0	A survey of UK general practitioners about depression, antidepressants and withdrawal: implementing the 2019 Public Health England report. Background: In 2019, a literature review indicated that more than half of people who try to come off antidepressants experience withdrawal effects. Both the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists updated their positions in line with that review, and Public Health England published a 152-page report called Dependence and withdrawal associated with some prescribed medicines: an evidence review. The report made several recommendations relevant to general practice., Method: In order to facilitate implementation of these recommendations, an online survey was designed to explore United Kingdom general practitioner (GP) experiences, opinions, knowledge and needs in relation to depression, ADs and withdrawal. A total of 66 GPs had completed the survey when COVID-19 occurred., Results: In keeping with previous findings, this small sample of GPs had a predominantly psycho-social perspective on the causes of, and treatments for, depression. They broadly considered ADs effective for moderate/severe depression and ineffective for minimal/mild depression, for which they preferred psychological therapies and social prescribing. There was a marked lack of consistency in GPs' knowledge about the incidence and duration of withdrawal effects. Only a minority (29%) felt their knowledge about withdrawal was 'adequate' and fewer (17%) believed this about their 'Ability to distinguish between withdrawal effects and return of the original problem (e.g. depression)'. Two-thirds (68%) would like more training on these matters., Conclusion: It is hoped that even this small sample will be helpful when designing, and seeking funding for, GP training programmes, and when implementing the PHE recommendations for support services, based in the primary care system, for the millions of people contemplating or initiating withdrawal from ADs every year in the UK.

0	"The impact of COVID-19 on cervicofacial infection of dental aetiology. Cervicofacial infections of dental aetiology can be life-threatening and with the closure of dental practices following the onset of the COVID-19, it would be anticipated that their prevalence presenting to maxillofacial surgery would increase and services may be overwhelmed, with patients presenting later with a potential subsequent increase in morbidity. A retrospective analysis of patients with cervicofacial infection of dental aetiology referred to maxillofacial surgery during the initial six weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 was carried out and compared with the equivalent period in the two preceding years. Unexpectedly, during COVID-19 lockdown, there was a reduction in patients seen with cervicofacial infection of dental aetiology. This may have resulted from patient adherence to government guidelines ""Stay at home"", successful triaging of patients in primary care and emergency treatment provided by urgent dental care centres. Proportionally more patients who presented to hospital had received prior antibiotic therapy and required in-patient admission. All patients admitted received incision and drainage, with an increase extraoral drainage and an associated reduction in length of stay. During COVID-19 lockdown, maxillofacial managed a reduced number of patients with cervicofacial infection, likely resulting from primary and secondary dental care working together. The rate of incision and drainage of patients not admitted increased under local anaesthesia with increase of extraoral drainage and reduced length of stay for those admitted. Crown Copyright © 2020.

0	Simulating phase transitions and control measures for network epidemics caused by infections with presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic stages. We investigate phase transitions associated with three control methods for epidemics on small world networks. Motivated by the behavior of SARS-CoV-2, we construct a theoretical SIR model of a virus that exhibits presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic stages in two possible pathways. Using agent-based simulations on small world networks, we observe phase transitions for epidemic spread related to: 1) Global social distancing with a fixed probability of adherence. 2) Individually initiated social isolation when a threshold number of contacts are infected. 3) Viral shedding rate. The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor. Individually initiated social isolation was effective when initiated in response to a single infected contact. For each of these control measures, the total number of infections exhibits a sharp phase transition as the strength of the measure is varied.	false
0	A Systematic Review of COVID-19 Infection in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Universal Effort to Preserve Patients' Lives and Allografts. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a significant challenge to physicians and healthcare systems worldwide. Evidence about kidney transplant (KTx) recipients is still limited. A systematic literature review was performed. We included 63 articles published from 1 January until 7 July 2020, reporting on 420 adult KTx recipients with confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 55 +/- 15 years. There was a male predominance (67%). The majority (74%) were deceased donor recipients, and 23% were recently transplanted (<1 year). Most patients (88%) had at least one comorbidity, 29% had two, and 18% three. Ninety-three percent of cases were hospitalized. Among them, 30% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 45% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 44% had acute kidney injury with 23% needing renal replacement therapy. From the hospitalized patients a total of 22% died, 59% were discharged, and 19% were still in hospital at the time of publication. Immunosuppression was reduced in 27%, discontinued in 31%, and remained unchanged in 5%. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 78% of patients, antibiotics to 73%, and antivirals to 30% while 25% received corticosteroid boluses, 28% received anti-interleukin agents, and 8% were given immunoglobulin. The main finding of our analysis was that the incidence of COVID-19 among kidney transplant patients is not particularly high, but when they do get infected, this is related to significant morbidity and mortality.	false
0	Nosocomial COVID-19 Infection and Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia in Patients Hospitalized for Alcoholic Liver Disease: A Case Report. BACKGROUND COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It has spread rapidly through the world, endangering human life. The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs; however, it can involve other organs, including the liver. Patients with severe COVID-19 have an increased incidence of abnormal liver function, and patients with liver disorders are considered to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The mechanism of liver injury reported in 14% to 53% of COVID-19 patients is poorly recognized and several possibilities need to be considered (cytokine storm, direct viral action, hypoxia). The incidence of underlying liver comorbidities in patients with a COVID-19 infection ranges from 1% to 11%. CASE REPORT This is a report of 2 nosocomial COVID-19 infections and severe COVID-19 pneumonia in 2 patients who were hospitalized during treatment for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Case 1 and case 2 were a 31-year-old woman and a 40-year-old woman, respectively, with decompensated ALD and symptoms of the COVID-19 infection. Both patients were transferred from another hospital to our hospital after confirmation of COVID-19 during their hospitalization. The course of the infection progressed rapidly in both patients with the development of multiple-organ failure and death over a short period. CONCLUSIONS There are no clear recommendations on the management of ALD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Alcoholic hepatitis may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome. A high percentage of nosocomial COVID-19 infections are observed; therefore, special precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure.	false
0	Venous thromboembolism and bleeding in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with higher than standard low molecular weight heparin doses and aspirin: A call to action. Background: Critically ill COVID-19 patients have a clear pattern of inflammation and hypercoagulable state. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients basing on prothrombotic risk factors (i.e. D-dimer). We also evaluated the impact of different doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on the incidence of bleedings. Method(s): The data of forty-two patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were retrospectively analyzed. On ICU admission, patients with D-dimer < 3000 ng/mL (Group 1) received enoxaparin 4000 UI (6000 UI, if body mass index >35) subcutaneously b.i.d. and patients with D-dimer >= 3000 ng/mL (Group 2) received enoxaparin 100 UI/kg every 12 h. Aspirin was administered to all patients once a day. Result(s): Both groups presented a high incidence of perivascular thrombosis (40.9% in Group 1 and 30% in Group 2). Patients of Group 2 suffered a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than Group 1 (65% vs 13.6%, p = 0.001). One patient (4.5%) of Group 1 and three patients (15%) of Group 2 suffered from minor bleeding; no patient had major bleeding. Group 2 had a longer ICU and hospital stay than Group 1 (11.5 +/- 5.6 vs 9.0 +/- 4.8 and 30 +/- 4.9 vs 21 +/- 2.3, p < 0.05, respectively) as well as increased ICU mortality (25% vs 9.1%). Conclusion(s): More severe critically ill COVID-19 patients have a high incidence of VTE and worse outcome, despite the use of heparin at the therapeutic dose. However, the use of heparin did not increase the incidence of bleeding complications.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Post COVID-19 syndrome associated with orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome, small fiber neuropathy and benefit of immunotherapy: a case report. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel highly contagious infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The virus affects the human respiratory and other systems, and presents mostly as acute respiratory syndrome with fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea. The clinical manifestations vary from no symptoms to multiple organ failure. Majority of patients fully recover. Several postinfectious presumably autoimmune complications of COVID-19 affecting the brain or peripheral large nerve fibers have been reported. This report describes a post COVID-19 patient who developed chronic fatigue, orthostatic dizziness and brain fog consistent with orthostatic hypoperfusion syndrome (OCHOS), a form of orthostatic intolerance, and painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Initially, the patient was diagnosed with. OCHOS (detected by the tilt test with transcranial Doppler monitoring) and SFN (confirmed by skin biopsy), and both OCHOS/SFN were attributed to Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome of presumed autoimmune etiology. Patient recovered on symptomatic therapy. COVID-19 triggered exacerbation of OCHOS/SFN responded to immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. This case suggests that post COVID-19 syndrome may present as an autoimmune OCHOS/SFN and that early immunotherapy may be effective. Further studies are necessary to confirm the link between OCHOS/SFN and COVID-19 disease as well as to confirm the benefit of immunotherapy.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic has predominantly affected the adult population. The disease is less well-defined in children (<=18 years). This review summarises the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. The prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than adults, but paediatric disease is likely underdiagnosed as a result of the high numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases. Children are vulnerable to family cluster outbreaks, but are unlikely to be index cases within a household. Vertical transmission or breast milk transmission are yet to be proven. Between 10 and 90% of paediatric COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases typically present with mild symptoms, including cough, fever and sore throat. Intensive care admission and mortality are rare. Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 is a rare, but severe, newly emerging phenotype. At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 in adults or children; management is usually supportive. For severe or critical disease, including paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19, the decision to start antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy should be on a case-by-case basis; in the UK, this should be done within a clinical trial. Further research is needed into both the disease course and treatment of paediatric COVID-19.	false
0	Study of transmission dynamics of novel COVID-19 by using mathematical model. In this research work, we present a mathematical model for novel coronavirus-19 infectious disease which consists of three different compartments: susceptible, infected, and recovered under convex incident rate involving immigration rate. We first derive the formulation of the model. Also, we give some qualitative aspects for the model including existence of equilibriums and its stability results by using various tools of nonlinear analysis. Then, by means of the nonstandard finite difference scheme (NSFD), we simulate the results for the data of Wuhan city against two different sets of values of immigration parameter. By means of simulation, we show how protection, exposure, death, and cure rates affect the susceptible, infected, and recovered population with the passage of time involving immigration. On the basis of simulation, we observe the dynamical behavior due to immigration of susceptible and infected classes or one of these two. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Determinants of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the West Herzegovina Canton. A study of COVID-19 infected patients was conducted regarding to organic and psychological characteristics. The findings of the study indicate that in the period of the pandemic in 2020, a total of 78 infection cases were confirmed in West Herzegovina Canton. Of the total number of infected, 55.1% are women and 44.9% are men. Of the infected population, 16.7% were hospitalized. By monitoring the COVID-19 disease in West Herzegovina Canton, we conclude how all manifestations of the disease were represented, from asymptomatic, through mild respiratory to the most severe clinical picture with fatal outcomes. The mortality rate in West Herzegovina Canton is 5.1%. The study showed that a total of 28.2% of COVID-19 positive patients before infecting with virus, were most likely to suffer from hypertension, diabetes and malignancies. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that a total of 71.9% of those infected are without underlying diseases. Also, the results indicate that people with COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic symptoms of the disease (fever, fatigue, cough, etc.) had certain mental ailments such as decreased general mood, increased anxiety, panic attacks, acute stress disorder and others.	false
0	New-Onset Nephrotic Syndrome in a Child Associated With COVID-19 Infection. Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak has become a worldwide public health emergency. The renal histopathological features of acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic microangiopathy have been previously reported in adults with severe COVID-19 infections. In children, the renal manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease are not widely reported. Here we describe a case report of a child with new-onset nephrotic syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection. Case Presentation: An 8-year-old boy with no previous significant medical history presented with bilateral eyelid and facial swelling soon after his parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. He had diarrhea but no fever or shortness of breath. At 1 week after the onset of swelling, the boy tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Based on clinical findings of significant proteinuria (urine protein and creatinine ratio of 11.4), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of 2 g/dl), and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol of 384 mg/dl), he was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. He responded well to standard-dose prednisone treatment for nephrotic syndrome. At 1 week after starting the prednisone treatment, he went into clinical remission. Lymphopenia continued to be present for 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. There were no complications related to clot formation or secondary infections with this presentation. Conclusion:  COVID-19 can be associated with new-onset nephrotic syndrome in children. The patient responded well to the standard-dose prednisone treatment that is typically used for new-onset nephrotic syndrome. Summary: We describe the unique presentation of COVID-19 in a child as new-onset nephrotic syndrome. We offer insight on the success of standard treatment of nephrotic syndrome with COVID-19.

0	Effect of surface morphology change of polystyrene microspheres through etching on protein corona and phagocytic uptake. Surface physicochemistry properties of polymer particles are crucial for protein corona formation and macrophage phagocytosis when they contact with living body. In this work, polystyrene microspheres (PS-MSs) were selected as a model of polymer microparticles and fabricated by chromic acid etching through controlling conditions to obtain different surface morphology structures and to investigate their effect on the protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake of PS-MSs. The adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and fibrinogen (FIB) on PS-MSs showed almost the same tendency, i.e. the etched PS-MSs presented lower protein adsorption compared with original microspheres. The adsorption of BSA and FIB was the lowest when the protuberances on the etched surfaces were maximum and the size of the protuberances was minimum. Furthermore, the surface morphologies of PS-MSs were influenced in return not only by the amounts of proteins but also by protein types. Meanwhile, the macrophages phagocytosis of PS-MSs depended on the amounts and kinds of adsorbed proteins, especially the albumin content. In a word, phagocytosis and protein adsorption can be regulated by microsphere morphologies through etching, which provides a promising strategy to avoid invalid uptake for polymer particles such as drug delivery carriers.	false
0	The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Prognosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Adult Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred and has rapidly spread worldwide. However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72)., CONCLUSIONS: AKI is uncommon but carries high in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

0	"Pandemic products and volatile chemical emissions. The recent pandemic (COVID-19) has seen a sweeping and surging use of products intended to clean and disinfect, such as air sprays, hand sanitizers, and surface cleaners, many of which contain fragrance. However, exposure to fragranced cleaning products has been associated with adverse effects on human health. Products can emit a range of volatile chemicals, including some classified as hazardous, but relatively few ingredients are disclosed to the public. Thus, relatively little is known about the specific emissions from these products. This study investigates the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from ""pandemic products"" that are being used frequently and extensively in society. In addition, among these emissions, this study identifies potentially hazardous compounds, compares so-called green and regular versions of products, and examines whether ingredients are disclosed to the public. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 26 commonly used pandemic products, including 13 regular and 13 so-called green versions, were analyzed for their volatile emissions. Product types included hand sanitizers, air disinfectants, multipurpose cleaners, and handwashing soap. All products were fragranced. The analyses found the products collectively emitted 399 VOCs with 127 VOCs classified as potentially hazardous. All products emitted potentially hazardous compounds. Comparing regular products and green products, no significant difference was found in the emissions of the most prevalent compounds. Further, among the 399 compounds emitted, only 4% of all VOCs and 11% of potentially hazardous VOCs were disclosed on any product label or safety data sheet. This study reveals that pandemic products can generate volatile emissions that could pose risks to health, that could be unrecognized, and that could be reduced, such as by using fragrance-free versions of products.

0	Neonatal and Children's Immune System and COVID-19: Biased Immune Tolerance versus Resistance Strategy. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a major global health concern. Although susceptible to infection, recent evidence indicates mostly asymptomatic or mild presentation of the disease in infants, children, and adolescents. Similar observations were made for acute respiratory infections caused by other coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome). These observations suggest that the immune system behaves differently in children than adults. Recent developments in the field demonstrated fundamental differences in the neonatal immune system as compared with adults, whereby infants respond to microorganisms through biased immune tolerance rather than resistance strategies. Similarly, more frequent/recent vaccinations in children and younger populations may result in trained immunity. Therefore, the physiological abundance of certain immunosuppressive cells, a tightly regulated immune system, and/or exposure to attenuated vaccines may enhance trained immunity to limit excessive immune reaction to COVID-19 in the young.Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.	false
0	Hemostatic Abnormalities in COVID-19: An Update. COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic with lung being the primarily afflicted organ. Deranged hemostasis has been observed in patients with COVID-19 with scales tipped towards a prothrombotic state. The pathogenesis differs from disseminated intravascular coagulation with a primary pulmonary localization. This is referred to as pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy with strong component of thrombo-inflammation. This is reflected in the lab tests with an increase in D-dimer which correlates with severity and outcomes of disease. Common coagulation tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time are only mildly prolonged while most patients have normal to increased fibrinogen and marginal thrombocytopenia. Overall, the patients have an increase in venous and arterial thrombotic events especially in ICU patients. Routine thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is recommended in all hospitalized patients to reduce the incidence of thrombosis. Bleeding is uncommon and treated with blood products transfusion. This review shall discuss the hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and their impact on prognosis. In addition, strategy of thromboprophylaxis and various academic society guidelines are discussed in detail.Copyright © 2020, Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion.	false
0	Benefits and limitations of serological assays in COVID-19 infection. Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.Copyright © 2020 Tuberculosis Association of India	false

0	Multivitamins for acute respiratory tract infections: a rapid review. Seven human clinical trials with some risk of bias suggest that multivitamins may be a safe and effective intervention to relieve some symptoms of respiratory tract infections, increase micronutrient status and immune function; however, further research is needed. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend multivitamins as a therapy for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Verdict The overall quality of research examining the effect of prophylactic multivitamin supplementation on the effects of the acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) is weak. Most of the available research included adults aged 50 years or over recruited through either the community or institutional settings (i.e. hospital facility, residential care facility). The multivitamin supplements used contained at least five vitamins and minerals and were administered between three months and two years (median: 15 months). Based on the available evidence, multivitamin supplementation does not appear to reduce the incidence of ARTI or mortality (both ARTI-related and all-cause). The effect of multivitamins taken before infection on the duration of ARTI is unclear due to conflicting results across studies. Multivitamins may, however, reduce the symptoms associated with ARTI such as headache, conjunctivitis, and activity restriction but not the overall symptom scores. No differences in health service visits, inclusive of primary and tertiary care, has been identified for individuals taking a multivitamin prior to an ARTI.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Human confrontation with such a stressor as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, manifested in severe acute respiratory distress, results also in the decrease of fitness and mental resistance on an unprecedented scale and with difficult to estimate consequences [1]. More important than the intensity of the disorder is its prevalence. When we compare our current knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental disorders with the findings of research on acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over the last 40 years, it may turn out that they are different from each other, the symptomatic spectrum of mental disorders varies and the possibilities of an effective treatment are very limited. We cannot rule out that a new diagnostic category for specific mental disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge in the near future. This paper presents the extent of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental instability and current diagnostic possibilities. Subpopulations necessary for planning short-term intervention in the organizational, informative and medical areas were identified. A psychiatric guide for immediate support and assistance was proposed.Copyright © 2020 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.	false
0	Direct activation of the alternative complement pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins is blocked by factor D inhibition. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can lead to venous/arterial thrombosis, stroke, renal failure, myocardial infarction, thrombocytopenia, and other end-organ damage. Animal models demonstrating end-organ protection in C3 deficient mice and evidence of complement activation in humans have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement-mediated endothelial damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (subunit 1 and 2), but not N protein, directly activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC). Complement dependent killing using the modified Ham test is blocked by either C5 or factor D inhibition. C3 fragments and C5b-9 are deposited on TF1PIGAnull target cells, and complement factor Bb is increased in the supernatant from spike protein treated cells. C5 inhibition prevents the accumulation of C5b-9 on cells, but not C3c; however, factor D inhibition prevents both C3c and C5b-9 accumulation. Addition of factor H mitigates the complement attack. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins convert non-activator surfaces to activator surfaces by preventing the inactivation of the cell surface APC convertase. APC activation may explain many of the clinical manifestations (microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal injury, and thrombophilia) of COVID-19 that are also observed in other complement-driven diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. C5 inhibition prevents accumulation of C5b-9 in vitro but does not prevent upstream complement activation in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.Copyright © 2020 American Society of Hematology.	false
0	Expansion of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibody-Secreting Cells and Generation of Neutralizing Antibodies in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. Pathogen-specific Abs are typically a major predictor of protective immunity, yet human B cell and Ab responses during COVID-19 are not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed Ab-secreting cell and Ab responses in 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific Ab-secreting cells in all 20 COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot Assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Abs by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM Ab levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Ab titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing Abs in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Last, we showed that IL-6 and C-reactive protein serum concentrations were higher in patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and C-reactive protein could be used as markers for COVID-19 severity. Altogether, this study constitutes a detailed description of clinical and immunological parameters in 20 COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and Ab responses, and describes tools to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.	false
0	The COVID-19 Pandemic and Ethics in Mexico Through a Gender Lens. In Mexico, significant ethical and social issues have been raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the most pressing issues are the extent of restrictive measures, the reciprocal duties to healthcare workers, the allocation of scarce resources, and the need for research. While policy and ethical frameworks are being developed to face these problems, the gender perspective has been largely overlooked in most of the issues at stake. Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, which can be exacerbated during a pandemic: stress and economic uncertainty are triggers for abuse, and confinement limits access to support networks. Confinement also exacerbates the unfair distribution of unpaid labor, which is disproportionately assigned to women and girls, and highlights inequality in the overall labor market. Lack of security measures has resulted in attacks towards health workers, particularly female nurses, due to fear of contamination. Finally, resource results in lack of access to other health necessities, including sexual and reproductive health services. Research across all disciplines to face-and to learn from-this crisis should be done through a gender lens, because understanding the realities of women is essential to understand the pandemic's true effects in Mexico and the world.	false
0	Impact of glycan cloud on the B-cell epitope prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China in late 2019 and has since spread to pandemic proportions. Diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. We model the trimeric Spike protein, including flexible loops and all N-glycosylation sites, in order to elucidate accessible epitopes for antibody-based diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development. Based on published experimental data, six homogeneous glycosylation patterns and two heterogeneous ones were used for the analysis. The glycan chains alter the accessible surface areas on the S-protein, impeding antibody-antigen recognition. In presence of glycan, epitopes on the S1 subunit, that notably contains the receptor binding domain, remain mostly accessible to antibodies while those present on the S2 subunit are predominantly inaccessible. We identify 28 B-cell epitopes in the Spike structure and group them as non-affected by the glycan cloud versus those which are strongly masked by the glycan cloud, resulting in a list of favourable epitopes as targets for vaccine development, antibody-based therapy and diagnostics.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	A Novel Protocol for Very Early Hospital Discharge following STEMI. Although the incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is on the decline, management of patients presenting with STEMI continues to require significant healthcare resources. Earlier hospital discharge in low-risk patients presenting with STEMI has been an area of focus in an attempt to reduce healthcare costs. As a result, discharge within 48-72 hrs following successful primary PCI has increasingly become routine practice. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous pressure on healthcare systems to find ways to increase bed-capacity, preserve resources, and reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers. In response to this goal, the Ottawa Heart Institute has developed and implemented a novel Very Early Hospital Discharge (VEHD) protocol. The VEHD protocol is a simple, four-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk STEMI patients that can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary PCI. Once deemed eligible for VEHD pre-discharge tasks are completed by the treating medical and nursing team and the patient is discharged home. Follow-up is completed remotely via through virtual care (48-hours, 7-days, 30-days), and in the outpatient cardiology clinic (4-6 weeks). Amid a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we believe the VEHD protocol is a crucial step in maintaining exceptional quality of care, both in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, while concurrently lowering the risk of nosocomial infections, and reducing resource utilization.Copyright © 2020.

0	Beyond COVID-19: DO MS/NMO-SD patients treated with anti-CD20 therapies develop SARS-CoV2 antibodies?. Since 2019, a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) due to an agent called SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMO-SD) are often treated with immunosuppressants. Beyond their effect on the risk of COVID-19 infection, the consequences on the long-term immune response against the coronavirus remain unknown. Among 13 MS or NMOSD patients with confirmed COVID-19 included, all 5 patients treated with anti-CD20 therapies had a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology. To date, maximal precautions to prevent coronavirus infection should be maintained in MS/NMOSD patients already exposed to COVID-19 during anti-CD20 therapy. Copyright © 2020.

0	Social Distancing and Public Health Guidelines at Workplaces in Korea: Responses to Coronavirus Disease-19. Background: In the absence of a vaccine or treatment, the most pragmatic strategies against an infectious disease pandemic are extensive early detection testing and social distancing. This study aimed to summarize public and workplace responses to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and show how the Korean system has operated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Daily briefings from the Korean Center for Disease Control and the Central Disaster Management Headquarters were assembled from January 20 to May 15, 2020. Result(s): By May 15, 2020, 11,018 COVID-19 cases were identified, of which 15.7% occurred in workplaces such as health-care facilities, call centers, sports clubs, coin karaoke, and nightlife destinations. When the first confirmed case was diagnosed, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Central Disaster Management Headquarters responded quickly, emphasizing early detection with numerous tests and a social distancing policy. This slowed the spread of infection without intensive containment, shut down, or mitigation interventions. After entering the public health blue alert level, a business continuity plan was distributed. After entering the orange level, the Ministry of Employment and Labor developed workplace guidelines for COVID-19 consisting of social distancing, flexible working schedules, early identification of workers with suspected infections, and disinfection of workplaces. Owing to the intensive workplace social distancing policy, workplaces remained safe with only small sporadic group infections. Conclusion(s): The workplace social distancing policy with timely implementation of specific guidelines was a key to preventing a large outbreak of COVID-19 in Korean workplaces. However, sporadic incidents of COVID-19 are still ongoing, and risk assessment in vulnerable workplaces should be continued.Copyright © 2020 The Author	false
0	Interleukin-6 Blocking vs. JAK-STAT Inhibition for Prevention of Lung Injury in Patients with COVID-19. The severe respiratory insufficiency observed during COVID-19 infection may not be directly related to a cytopathogenic effect induced by the virus itself, but to an exaggerated and inappropriate immune response. In an effort to reduce the severity of organ dysfunction, including respiratory insufficiency, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that block the interleukin-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab, are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. However, blocking of just one of the many cytokines involved in the inflammatory reaction may not slow down the magnitude of the process. Since timing is important, the immune deficiency induced by IL6 blockade at the late immunodeficiency phase of sepsis that follows the initial inflammatory response may be detrimental. Finally, monitoring the degree and duration of IL6 blockade may be challenging because of the long half-life of Mabs (2-3 weeks). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines act through a common JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can be inhibited by JAK-STAT inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for JAK1, 2, blocks many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL6. Ruxolitinib has favorable pharmacodynamics and an acceptable safety profile. The short half-life (4-6 h) of the drug offers the opportunity for ideal monitoring of the degree and duration of cytokine blocking, simply by the adjusting dose and duration of therapy. From a theoretical point of view, the balanced control of cytokine blockade throughout the course of the septic process should be the cornerstone of modern management. According to this hypothesis, maximization of blocking should be attempted at the phase of hyper-inflammation for preventing severe organ damage, while pro-inflammatory blockade should be minimized at the late phase of immunoparalysis for prevention of secondary infections. Based on the above considerations, we consider that the efficacy and safety of this drug deserves testing in the context of a controlled randomized trial.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Prevalence and outcomes of re-positive nucleic acid tests in discharged COVID-19 patients. The prevalence and outcomes of patients who had re-activation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge remain poorly understood. We included 126 consecutively confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 2-month follow-up data after discharge in this retrospective study. The upper respiratory specimen using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test of three patients (71 years [60-76]) were positive within 11-20 days after their discharge, with an event rate of 19.8 (95%CI 2.60-42.1) per 1,000,000 patient-days. Moreover, all re-positive patients were asymptomatic. Our findings suggest that few recovered patients may still be virus carriers even after reaching the discharge criteria.	false
0	Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and Diverse RNA and DNA Viruses on 3D Printed Surgical Mask Materials. BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternative sources of surgical masks, including 3D-printed approaches that may be reused, are urgently needed to prevent PPE shortages. Few data exist identifying decontamination strategies to inactivate viral pathogens and retain 3D-printing material integrity. OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: Test viral disinfection methods on 3D-printing materials. METHOD(S): The virucidal activity of common disinfectants (10% bleach, quaternary ammonium sanitizer, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 70% isopropanol and exposure to heat (50oC, and 70oC) were tested on four 3D-printed materials used in the healthcare setting, including one used in a surgical mask design developed by the Veterans Health Administration. Inactivation was assessed for several clinically relevant RNA and DNA pathogenic viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. RESULT(S): SARS-CoV-2 and all viruses tested were completely inactivated by a single application of bleach, ammonium quaternary compounds, or hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, exposure to dry heat (70oC) for 30 minutes completely inactivated all viruses tested. In contrast, 70% isopropanol reduced viral titers significantly less well following a single application. Inactivation did not interfere with material integrity of the 3D-printed materials. CONCLUSION(S): Several standard decontamination approaches effectively disinfected 3D-printed materials. These approaches were effective in the inactivation SARS-CoV-2, its surrogates and other clinically relevant viral pathogens. The decontamination of 3D printed surgical mask materials may be useful during crisis situations where surgical mask supplies are limited.	false
0	Immune monitoring facilitates the clinical decision in multifocal COVID-19 of a pancreas-kidney transplant patient. The optimal management in transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains uncertain. The main concern is the ability of immunosuppressed patients to generate sufficient immunity for antiviral protection. Here, we report on immune monitoring facilitating a successful outcome of severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis, and acute kidney and pancreas graft failure in a pancreas-kidney transplant recipient. Despite the very low numbers of circulating B, NK, and T cells identified in follow-up, a strong SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell response was observed. Importantly, we detected T cells reactive to Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with majority of T cells showing polyfunctional proinflammatory Th1 phenotype at all analyzed time points. Antibodies against Spike protein were also detected with increasing titers in follow-up. Neutralization tests confirmed their antiviral protection. A correlation between cellular and humoral immunity was observed underscoring the specificity of demonstrated data. We conclude that analyzing the kinetics of nonspecific and SARS-CoV-2-reactive cellular and humoral immunity can facilitate the clinical decision on immunosuppression adjustment and allow successful outcome as demonstrated in the current clinical case. Although the antiviral protection of the detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells requires further evaluation, our data prove an ability mounting a strong SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response with functional capacity in immunosuppressed patients.

0	New loss of smell and taste: Uncommon symptoms in COVID-19 patients on Nord Franche-Comte cluster, France. BACKGROUND: New loss of smell or taste was not included as common symptoms of COVID-19 until March 2020 when the pandemic started in Western countries. We want to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nord Franche-Comte Hospital, Trevenans, France, between March, 1st and March, 14th 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. RESULT(S): Of 70 patient enrolled, the mean age was 57.0 years and 29 patients (41%) were men. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 1.70(+/-2.5). Twenty-seven (39%) patients had pneumonia. Fatigue (93% [65]), cough (80% [55]) and fever (77% [54]) were the three main symptoms. Neurologic symptoms were present in more than half of the patients: anosmia (53% [37]) and dysgeusia (48% [34]). The mean duration of anosmia was 7.4 (+/-5, [1-21]) days, 51% (36/70) recovered before 28 days of evolution. Only one patient with anosmia had not recovered at the end of the follow-up. Patients with anosmia had less often a pneumonia (10/37 vs 17/33, p=0.036), were less often hospitalized (13/37 vs 20/33, p=0.033) and needed less often oxygen therapy (6/37 vs 17/33, p=0.002) than patients without anosmia. There were no statistically differences for viral load between patients with anosmia and patients without anosmia (5.5 [2.0-8.6] vs 5.3 [2.1-8.5] log copies/ml respectively, p=0.670). The fatality of COVID-19 in our study was 6% with four deaths. CONCLUSION(S): Anosmia and dysgeusia are present in half of COVID-19 patients. The mean duration of anosmia was 7 days and the outcome seems favorable in less than 28 days.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets and antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. BACKGROUND: Marked progress is achieved in understanding the physiopathology of COVID-19 that caused global pandemics. However, CD4+ T cell population that is critical for antibody response in COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHOD(S): In this study, we provided a comprehensive analysis of peripheral CD4+ T cells of 13 COVID-19 convalescent patients, as defined as confirmed free of SARS-CoV-2 for 2-4 weeks, using flow cytometry, magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme antibody immunoassay and correlated the data with clinical characteristics. RESULT(S): We observed that relative to healthy individuals, convalescent patients displayed an altered peripheral CD4+ T cell spectrum. Specifically, consistent with other viral infections, cTFH1 cell associated with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, which was found to skew with disease severity as more severe individuals showed higher frequency of TEM and TFH-EM cells but a lower frequency of TCM, TFH-CM and TNaive cells, relative to mild and moderate patients. Interestingly, higher frequency of cTFH-EM cells correlated with lower number of recorded admission blood oxygen level in convalescent patients. These observations might constitute residual effects by which COVID-19 can impact the homeostasis of CD4+ T cells in the long-term and explain the highest ratio of class-switched virus-specific antibody producing individuals found in our severe COVID-19 cohort. CONCLUSION(S): Together, our study demonstrated close connection between CD4+ T cells and antibody production in COVID-19 convalescents. FUNDING: This study was supported by Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants 81970759.	false
0	Nosocomial Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Experience from a large Acute NHS Trust in South-West London. Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare settings has significant implications for patients and healthcare workers, can amplify local outbreaks, and place additional burden on already stretched resources. Risk of missed or late diagnosis of COVID-19 was high during the United Kingdom's initial 'containment phase', because of strict criteria for testing. The risk remains due to asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission, complicated by challenges faced with laboratory testing. We present a case study of potential nosocomial transmission associated with the first case of COVID-19 at a large acute NHS Trust in South-West London and describe the prevailing burden of nosocomial infections.Copyright © 2020.

0	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children With COVID-19 in Mumbai, India. OBJECTIVE: We describe the presentation, treatment and outcome of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome with COVID-19 (MIS-C) in Mumbai metropolitan area in India. METHOD(S): This is an observational study conducted at four tertiary hospitals in Mumbai. Parameters including demographics, symptomatology, laboratory markers, medications and outcome were obtained from patient hospital records and analyzed in patients treated for MIS-C (as per WHO criteria) from 1 May, 2020 to 15 July, 2020. RESULT(S): 23 patients (11 males) with median (range) age of 7.2 (0.8-14) years were included. COVID19 RT PCR or antibody was positive in 39.1% and 30.4%, respectively; 34.8% had a positive contact. 65% patients presented in shock; these children had a higher age (P=0.05), and significantly higher incidence of myocarditis with elevated Troponin, NT pro BNP and LV dysfunction, along with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, as compared to those without shock. Coronary artery dilation was seen in 26% patients overall. Steroids were used most commonly for treatment (96%), usually along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (65%). Outcome was good with only one death. CONCLUSION(S): Initial data on MIS-C from India is presented. Further studies and longer surveillance of patients with MIS-C are required to improve our diagnostic, treatment and surveillance criteria.	false
0	Mechanical and Non-Mechanical Functions of Filamentous and Non-Filamentous Vimentin. Intermediate filaments (IFs) formed by vimentin are less understood than their cytoskeletal partners, microtubules and F-actin, but the unique physical properties of IFs, especially their resistance to large deformations, initially suggest a mechanical function. Indeed, vimentin IFs help regulate cell mechanics and contractility, and in crowded 3D environments they protect the nucleus during cell migration. Recently, a multitude of studies, often using genetic or proteomic screenings show that vimentin has many non-mechanical functions within and outside of cells. These include signaling roles in wound healing, lipogenesis, sterol processing, and various functions related to extracellular and cell surface vimentin. Extracellular vimentin is implicated in marking circulating tumor cells, promoting neural repair, and mediating the invasion of host cells by viruses, including SARS-CoV, or bacteria such asListeriaandStreptococcus. These findings underscore the fundamental role of vimentin in not only cell mechanics but also a range of physiological functions.	false
0	A public-private partnership for the express development of antiviral leads: a perspective view. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic raises the question of strategic readiness for emergent pathogens. The current case illustrates that the cost of inaction can be higher in the future. The perspective article proposes a dedicated, government-sponsored agency developing anti-viral leads against all potentially dangerous pathogen species. Areas covered: The author explores the methods of computational drug screening and in-silico synthesis and proposes a specialized government-sponsored agency focusing on leads and functioning in collaboration with a network of labs, pharma, biotech firms, and academia, in order to test each lead against multiple viral species. The agency will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to cut the costs further. The algorithms are expected to receive continuous feedback from the network of partners conducting the tests. Expert opinion: The author proposes a bionic principle, emulating antibody response by producing a combinatorial diversity of high quality generic antiviral leads, suitable for multiple potentially emerging species. The availability of multiple pre-tested agents and an even greater number of combinations would reduce the impact of the next outbreak. The methodologies developed in this effort are likely to find utility in the design of chronic disease therapeutics.	false

0	Analysis of cardiopulmonary findings in COVID-19 fatalities: High incidence of pulmonary artery thrombi and acute suppurative bronchopneumonia. Since its recognition in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread globally causing a pandemic that represents the greatest medical challenge in decades. The aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of cardiopulmonary pathology of COVID-19 based on (non-minimal invasive) autopsies performed on 14 COVID-19 decedents. Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found in all patients. Superimposed acute bronchopneumonia was present in 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients and was considered the major cause of death in 2 patients. A key finding was the presence of thrombotic/thromboembolic vascular occlusions. We classified 5 types of pulmonary thrombi: 1. capillary microthrombi (11/14, 78.6%); 2. partially organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries with complete vessel occlusion; 3. non-organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries that did not completely fill out the vessel lumen and probably represented thromboemboli rather than thrombosis; 4. bone marrow emboli (1/14, 7.1%); and 5. septic pulmonary thromboemboli (1/14, 7.1%). Pulmonary thrombi in mid-sized arteries were noted in 5 of 14 (35.7%) patients, causing pulmonary infarction and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. All patients had evidence of chronic cardiac disease, including myocardial hypertrophy (13/14, 92.9%), mild to marked coronary artery atherosclerosis (14/14, 100%) and focal myocardial fibrosis (3/14, 21.4%). Acute myocardial infarction was found as concurrent cause of death in 3 (21.4%) patients, and significant cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight 750 g) was present in 1 (7.1%) patient with ATTR-positive cardiac amyloidosis. The autopsy findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, with major involvement of the lungs, that increases the risk of cardiac and vascular complications including acute myocardial injury and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Secondary acute bronchopneumonia is a common complication in patients with COVID-19 and may be the major cause of death. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19: Prevalences, Recovery Rates, and Clinical Associations on a Large Brazilian Sample. Objective. Our study aimed to measure the percentage of reported olfactory or taste losses and their severity, recovery time, and association with other features in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19. Study Design. Prospective survey. Setting. Quaternary medical center and online survey. Methods. The perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities. Results. The prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality-specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively. The majority reported anosmia (42.9%). The presence of chemosensory symptoms was not associated with COVID-19 severity. At a median time >2 months after the onset of symptoms, rates of total and partial olfaction recovery were 53.8% and 44.7%, while complete or partial return to previous taste function was 68.3% and 27.6%. Less than 5% of the patients reported no chemosensory function improvement at all. Conclusion. The prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction is high among patients with COVID-19. Almost all patients seem to recover a significant part of their smell and taste abilities in the first 4 months after the onset of symptoms.	false
0	Atypical Skin Manifestations During Immune Checkpoint Blockage in Coronavirus Disease 2019-Infected Patients With Lung Cancer. A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 by the WHO, has rapidly spread around the world since its first reported case in late December of 2019 from Wuhan, the People's Republic of China. As of mid-April 2020, this virus has affected more than 180 countries and territories, infecting more than 1,650,000 individuals and causing over 100,000 deaths. With approximately 20 million new cases globally per year, cancer affects a substantial portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections owing to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and the anticancer treatment. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, especially those with lung cancer who develop coronavirus disease 2019, experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study carried out by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association has also documented that patients with lung cancer had an increased risk of death, intensive care unit requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here, we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations-findings that could be influenced by the long-term use of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody.Copyright © 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer	false

0	Investigation of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Antibodies in the Patients with COVID-19 by Three Different ELISA Test Kits. We examined anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in 45 serum samples from 26 patients with COVID-19, who were admitted in our hospital by using three different ELISA kits. All patients had pneumonia at admission, and 7 patients required mechanical ventilator support and grouped in severe case. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies turned to be partially positive between the 6th and 10th days, more than 84% positive between the 11th and 15th days, and 100% after the 16th day. One ELISA kit revealed poorer sensitivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody. Negative conversion of IgM antibody was not observed in the 30th day in our cohort. All three ELISA kits showed no false positive reaction for negative serum samples. Between severe and moderate cases, there was no significant difference in the trends of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false

0	PROTECT Trial: A cluster-randomized study with hydroxychloroquine versus observational support for prevention or early-phase treatment of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. ObjectivesHydroxychloroquine has shown to have antiviral activity in vitro against coronaviruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2. It is believed to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus cell fusion and glycosylation of viral surface proteins. In addition to its antiviral activity, hydroxychloroquine has an immune-modulating activity that may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo, making it a potentially promising drug for the prevention and the cure of SARS-CoV-19. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether it can be used safely to treat COVID-19 patients or to prevent infection. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for (I) the prevention of COVID-19 or related symptoms in SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, such as as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients and (II) the treatment of early-phase asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients.Trial designThis is a controlled, open label, cluster-randomized, superiority trial with parallel group design. Subjects will be randomized either to receive hydroxychloroquine or to observation (2:1).ParticipantsSARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, including household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals (Group 1) or patients with COVID-19 (positive PCR test on a rhinopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situations who are not undergoing treatment with any anti COVID-19 medication (Group 2), will be enrolled. Paucisymptomatic patients are defined as patients with a low number of mild symptoms. All subjects must be aged >= 18 years, male or female, must be willing and able to give informed consent and must not have any contraindications to take hydroxychloroquine (intolerance or previous toxicity for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, bradycardia or reduction in heart rhythm with arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, congestive heart failure with use of diuretics, favism or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, diabetes type 1, major comorbidities such as advanced chronic kidney disease or dialysis therapy, known history of ventricular arrhythmia, any oncologic/hematologic malignancy, severe neurological and mental illness, current use of medications with known significant drug-drug interactions, and known prolonged QT syndrome or current use of drugs with known QT prolongation).The study is monocentric and will be conducted at Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS. Subjects will be enrolled from a large epidemic region (North-Central Italy). The Public Health Departments of several Italian regions will collaborate by identifying potentially eligible subjects.Intervention and comparatorThe participants will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to receive either hydroxychloroquine (Arm A) or to Observation (Arm B). Hydroxychloroquine will be administered with the following schedule:Group1: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by a weekly dose of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily on days 8, 15 and 22, for a total of one month of treatment.Group 2: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for a total of 5-7 days.The comparator in this trial is observation given that currently neither treatment is administered to asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects, nor prophylaxis is available for contacts. Hydroxychloroquine will be shipped to subjects within 24 hours of randomization. Given the extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, only telephonic interviews will be carried out and electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) completed. During treatment, each subject will be contacted every other day for the first week and weekly thereafter (Group 2) or weekly (Group 1) by a study physician to assess early onset of any COVID-19 symptom or any adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine and to check subject compliance. Furthermore, all subjects will receive periodic ePROs which may be completed through smartphone or tablets to record drug self-administration and onset of any symptom or adverse event. All subjects will be followed up for a total of 6 months by periodic telephonic interviews and ePROs.Main outcomesThe primary endpoint/outcome measure for this trial is: for Group 1, the proportion of subjects who become symptomatic and/or swab-positive in each arm within one month of randomization; for Group 2, the proportion of subjects who become swab-negative in each arm within 14 days of randomization.RandomizationAll household members and/or contacts of each COVID-19 index case, and the COVID-19 patient himself/herself, fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be grouped into a single cluster and this cluster will be randomized (2:1) to either arm A or arm B. Information on each subject will be recorded in specific data records.Randomization lists will be stratified according to the following factors regarding COVID-19 index cases:1. COVID-19 risk level on the basis of province of residence (high vs. low/intermediate);2. Index case is a healthcare professional (yes vs.no)3. Index case with COVID-19 treatment (yes vs. no)An independent statistician not otherwise involved in the trial will generate the allocation sequence, and COVID-19 response teams will be unaware of the allocation of clusters.Randomization will be performed through an interactive web-based electronic data-capturing database.An Independent Data Monitoring Committee has been established.Blinding (masking)This study is open label.Numbers to be randomized (sample size)For Group 1, a sample size of about 2000 SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects such as household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients will take part in the study. Assuming around 1.5-2.0 asymptomatic household members and/or contacts for each COVID-19 patient, we expect to identify approximately 1000-1300 COVID-19 index cases to be randomized. An interim analysis on efficacy is planned using standard alpha-spending function.For Group 2, sufficient power for primary objective (negative swab within 14 days of randomization) will be reached given a sample size of 300 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 subjects in home situations not treated for COVID-19 (25%-30% of about 1000-1300 expected index cases). Since up to date reduced evidence about COVID-19 infection epidemiology, the continuous update of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the sample size estimation could be updated after a one third of population will be recruited and eventually modified according to a substantial protocol amendment. An interim analysis at 100 enrolled COVID-19 patients is planned.We have planned a Generalized Estimating Equation analysis, which is more efficient than a cluster level analysis, to take advantage of subject-specific covariates. The above reported sample size analysis is therefore to be considered conservative.Trial StatusThe current version of the PROTECT trial protocol is `Final version, 15 April 2020'. The study started on 9(th) May 2020. The first patient was enrolled on 14(th) May 2020. Recruitment is expected to last through September 2020.Trial registrationThe PROTECT trial is registered in the EudraCT database (no. 2020-001501-24) and in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04363827), date of registration 24 April 2020.Full protocolThe full PROTECT protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

0	Real-Time Digital Contact Tracing: Development of a System to Control COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in nursing homes and long-term care (LTC) facilities. Symptoms-based screening and manual contact tracing have limitations that render them ineffective for containing the viral spread in LTC facilities. Symptoms-based screening alone cannot identify asymptomatic people who are infected, and the viral spread is too fast in confined living quarters to be contained by slow manual contact tracing processes., OBJECTIVE: We describe the development of a digital contact tracing system that LTC facilities can use to rapidly identify and contain asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected contacts. A compartmental model was also developed to simulate disease transmission dynamics and to assess system performance versus conventional methods., METHODS: We developed a compartmental model parameterized specifically to assess the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission in LTC facilities. The model was used to quantify the impact of asymptomatic transmission and to assess the performance of several intervention groups to control outbreaks: no intervention, symptom mapping, polymerase chain reaction testing, and manual and digital contact tracing., RESULTS: Our digital contact tracing system allows users to rapidly identify and then isolate close contacts, store and track infection data in a respiratory line listing tool, and identify contaminated rooms. Our simulation results indicate that the speed and efficiency of digital contact tracing contributed to superior control performance, yielding up to 52% fewer cases than conventional methods., CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing systems show promise as an effective tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC facilities. As facilities prepare to relax restrictions and reopen to outside visitors, such tools will allow them to do so in a surgical, cost-effective manner that controls outbreaks while safely giving residents back the life they once had before this pandemic hit.

0	COVID-19: treatment strategies of German-speaking pediatric rheumatologists Results of an online survey. Background Reliable data on the course and treatment of pediatric COVID-19 (”corona virus disease 2019”) in immunosuppressed patients with rheumatic diseases are missing. Aim Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. Methods In May 2020 all GKJR members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different stages of the disease were collected. Results A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA-4 and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral steroids, mycophenolate, IL-1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation was emphasized by many respondents. Conclusion The currently low prevalence of COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience. Therefore, the presented results have to be interpreted with caution and mostly as hypothetical treatment considerations. It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.	false
0	Epidemiology of and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infection in Health Care Workers A Living Rapid Review. Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Purpose: To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. Data Sources: Multiple electronic databases, including the WHO database of publications on coronavirus disease and the medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. Study Selection: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. Data Extraction: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis: 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a dose-response relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. Limitation: There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used. Conclusion: Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Use of PPE and infection control training are associated with decreased infection risk, and certain exposures are associated with increased risk.	false
0	Approach to critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy in the older SARS-CoV-2 patients. One of the major concerns of the health care community and the public surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the availability and use of ventilators. Unprecedented surges of patients presented to intensive care units across the country, with older adults making up a large proportion of the patient population. This paper illustrates contemporary approaches to critical illness myopathy (CIM), critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), and critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) in older patients, including incidence, risk factors, mechanisms for pathology, diagnosis, contemporary treatment approaches, and outcomes. We hope that the following analysis may help educate clinicians and ultimately decrease the duration of the mechanical ventilation required by these patients, resulting in improved clinical outcomes and an increase in ventilator availability for other patients in need.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 and other diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 53 randomized trials. INTRODUCTION: Many concerns still exist regarding the safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the safety of HCQ in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were retrieved starting from the establishment of the database till June 5, 2020. Literature screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk bias were performed independently by two reviewers., RESULTS: We identified 53 eligible studies involving 5496 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that the risk of adverse effects (AEs) in the HCQ group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (RD 0.05, 95%CI, 0.02 to 0.07, P = 0.0002), and the difference was also statistically significant in the COVID-19 subgroup (RD 0.15, 95%CI, 0.07 to 0.23, P = 0.0002) as well as in the subgroup for other diseases (RD 0.03, 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.04, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: HCQ is associated with a high total risk of AEs compared with the placebo or no intervention in the overall population. Given the small number of COVID-19 participants included, we should be cautious regarding the conclusion stating that HCQ is linked with an increase incidence of AEs in patients with COVID-19, which we hope to confirm in the future through well-designed and larger sample size studies.	false
0	Associations between serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, and COVID-19: A cross-sectional study. Background Serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) play critical roles in inflammation and are used in clinical laboratories as indicators of inflammation-related diseases. We aimed to provide potential laboratory basis for auxiliary distinguishing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by monitoring above indicators. Methods A total of 84 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were collected and analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to combined detection of SAA and IL-6 in patients with COVID-19, and independent risk factors for severity of COVID-19 were assessed by using binary logistic regression. Results The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever (98.8%), fatigue (61.9%), and dry cough (58.3%). SAA, IL-6, and NLR were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (allP < .001), and compared with nonsevere patients, three indicators of severe patients were significantly elevated. Besides, combined detection of SAA and IL-6 better separates healthy people from patients with COVID-19 than detection of SAA or IL-6 alone. In addition, elevated SAA, IL-6, and NLR can be used as independent variables for predicting the severity of patients with COVID-19. Conclusion Serum amyloid A and IL-6 could be used as addition parameters to helping the distinguish of patients with COVID-19 from healthy people, and can provide potential basis for separating patients with nonsevere and severe clinical signs.	false
0	Control measures to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in endoscopy centers: Multi-center study. Aims To investigate control measures for COVID-19 pandemic in GIE centers in China. Methods This is a retrospective multi-center research, including seven centers. Data collection was from 1 February to 31 March 2020 and the same period in 2019. Results There were a total of 28 COVID-19 definite cases in these hospitals. Six out of seven GIE centers were arranged to shut down on 1 February, with a mean number of shutdown days of 23.6 +/- 5.3. The actual workloads were only 10.3%-62.9% compared to those last year. All centers had a preoperative COVID-19 screening process. Epidemiological questionnaire, temperature taking and QR-code of journey were conducted. Chest CT scan was conducted during the shutdown period and continued in five centers after return to work. Antibody and nucleic acid test were applied in one to three centers. All endoscopists had advanced PPE. Five centers used surgical mask and the rest used N95 mask. Six centers used goggles or face shield. Five centers selected isolation gowns and the rest selected protective suits. The change frequency of these PPE was 4 h. Sterilizing measures were improved in six centers. Five centers utilized ultraviolet and six centers strengthened natural ventilation. Four and six centers used peracetic acid during the period of shutdown and return to work, alone or matched with OPA or acidified water. Conclusions Many effective control measures were conducted in GIE centers during the outbreak, including patients' volume limitation, preoperative COVID-19 screening, advanced PPE and disinfection methods.	false
0	Early detection of deep vein thrombosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: who to screen and who not to with Doppler ultrasound?. PURPOSE: Aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of DVT in COVID-19 patients and its correlation with the severity of the disease and with clinical and laboratory findings., METHODS: 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization guidelines, were included in the study. The severity of the disease was classified as moderate, severe and critical. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed in all patients. DUS findings, clinical, laboratory's and therapeutic variables were investigated by contingency tables, Pearson chi square test and by Student t test and Fisher's exact test. ROC curve analysis was applied to study significant continuous variables., RESULTS: Overall incidence of DVT was 10.7% (25/234): 1.6% (1/60) among moderate cases, 13.8% (24/174) in severely and critically ill patients. Prolonged bedrest and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with the presence of DVT (19.7%). Fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F ratio, respiratory rate, heparin administration, D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin and CRP showed correlation with DVT., CONCLUSION: DUS may be considered a useful and valid tool for early identification of DVT. In less severely affected patients, DUS as screening of DVT might be unnecessary. High rate of DVT found in severe patients and its correlation with respiratory parameters and some significant laboratory findings suggests that these can be used as a screening tool for patients who should be getting DUS.	false
0	Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a guide for the dermatologist. The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. While new skin manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview of the cutaneous side effects associated with the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin +/- interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir and darunavir) and treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed. Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management and key points for differential diagnosis are presented.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Lessons learnt (clinical outcomes and cost savings) from Virtual Stone Clinic (VSC) and their application in the era post Covid-19: Prospective outcomes over a 6-year period from a University Teaching Hospital. INTRODUCTION: We introduced a nurse-led virtual telephone-based stone follow-up clinic (VSC) for the surveillance of patients with asymptomatic renal calculi or those at a high risk of recurrent kidney stone disease (KSD). The aim of this study was to look at the outcomes of VSC and its role in the post COVID era. METHOD(S): Prospective outcomes were collected for all patients referred to the VSC over a 6-year period (March 2014-April 2020). VSC is led by specialist stone nurses for on-going surveillance of KSD patients. RESULT(S): A total of 290 patients were seen (468 individual appointments; 1.6+/-1.0 per patient), with a mean age of 57.0+/-15.8 years (range:17-92) and a male:female ratio of 3:2. The referral was for surveillance of asymptomatic small renal stones (230,79.3%); history of recurrent stone disease (45,15.5%); solitary kidneys (5,1.7%); cystine stones, young age and other conditions (10,3.4%). The mean stone size was 5.0+/-2.7 mm, followed-up with XR KUB (225,77.6%) and USS (65,22.4%), for median duration of 12 months (range: 3-24 months). At the end, 132(45.6%) remained in VSC, 106(36.6%) were discharged, 47(16.2%) returned to face-to-face clinic or treatment, and 5(1.7%) had emergency admissions. Of 47 patients that returned, 23(48.9%) developed new symptoms, 21(44.6%) had stone growth, and 3 defaulted to face-to-face appointment. Thirty-five patients needed surgical intervention (URS-21, SWL-12 and PCNL-1) and 10 were managed conservatively. VSC reduced the cost per clinic appointment from 27.9 to 2/patient (93% reduction), equating to a total saving of 12,006 over the study period. CONCLUSION(S): Nurse led VSC not only provided a safe follow-up, but also allowed to substantially reduce the cost of treatment by allowing patients to be either discharged or return to a face-to-face clinic or surgical intervention if needed. Post COVID, this model using telemedicine will have a much wider uptake and further help optimise healthcare resources.	false
0	Potential small-molecule drugs as available weapons to fight novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A review. Since the new coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has widely spread in Wuhan, China, with severe pneumonia, scientists and physicians have made remarkable efforts to use various options such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vaccines, small-molecule drugs and interferon therapies to control, prevent or treatment infections of 2019-nCoV. However, no vaccine or drug has yet been confirmed to completely treat 2019-nCoV. In this review, we focus on the use of potential available small-molecule drug candidates for treating infections caused by 2019-nCoV. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 outbreak by income: hitting hardest the most deprived. BACKGROUND: The impact of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has many facets. This ecological study analysed age-standardized incidence rates by economic level in Barcelona. METHOD(S): We evaluated confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Barcelona (Spain) between 26 February 2020 and 19 April 2020. Districts were classified according to most recent (2017) mean income data. The reference for estimating age-standardized cumulative incidence rates was the 2018 European population. The association between incidence rate and mean income by district was estimated with the Spearman rho. RESULT(S): The lower the mean income, the higher the COVID-19 incidence (Spearman rho = 0.83; P value = 0.003). Districts with the lowest mean income had the highest incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 inhabitants; in contrast, those with the highest income had the lowest incidence. Specifically, the district with the lowest income had 2.5 times greater incidence of the disease, compared with the highest-income district [70 (95% confidence interval 66-73) versus 28 (25-31), respectively]. CONCLUSION(S): The incidence of COVID-19 showed an inverse socioeconomic gradient by mean income in the 10 districts of the city of Barcelona. Beyond healthcare for people with the disease, attention must focus on a health strategy for the whole population, particularly in the most deprived areas.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	New COVID-19 saliva-based test: How good is it compared to the current nasopharyngeal or throat swab test?. As of 15 April 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization to a first saliva test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the device developed by RUCDR Infinite Biologics laboratory, Rutgers University. A key feature that distinguishes the saliva-based test from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal (throat) swabs is that this kit allows self-collection and can spare healthcare professionals to be at risk during collecting nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples, thereby preserving personal protective equipment for use in patient care rather than sampling and testing. Consequently, broader testing than the current methods of nasal or throat swabs will significantly increase the number of people screening, leading to more effective control of the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, a comparison of saliva-based assay with current swab test is needed to understand what and how we can benefit from this newly developed assay. Therefore, in this mini-review article, we aimed to summarize the current and emerging tools, focusing on diagnostic power of different clinical sampling and specimens.	false
0	Kawasaki disease fact check: Myths, misconceptions and mysteries. Kawasaki disease (KD) is an important cause of childhood vasculitis and a common cause of acquired heart disease in children world-wide. The emergence of Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome-Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2, a KD-like hyperinflammatory syndrome and the recent death of Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki make this a timely review. Although KD was described by Dr Kawasaki over 50 years ago, there is still no specific diagnostic test and the aetiology remains elusive. This article summarises the latest evidence, highlights important myths and misconceptions and discusses some of the mysteries that surround this disease.	false
0	CoVaccine HT TM adjuvant potentiates robust immune responses to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 immunisation. The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT TM or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT TM induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralising antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT TM can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Tocilizumab for patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective, multi-center study. BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin-6 receptor, may decrease the inflammatory response and control the symptoms of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the evidence is scarce., METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy who received tocilizumab in seven centers across Poland. We assessed on-treatment changes in clinical status and inflammatory markers., RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included (19 male), with a mean age of 61.7 +/- 12.4 years. The mean time from symptom onset to the first tocilizumab dose was 10.5 +/- 5.7 days. Clinical status improved within 24 hours in 11 (39%) patients, within one week in 23 (82%) patients, and within two weeks in 25 (89%); one (4%) patient showed no change and two (7%) patients died. Sixteen patients (57%) no longer needed oxygen therapy within a week (p < 0.001). The serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen decreased significantly (p <= 0.001). Lung changes improved in 21 (84%) patients within two weeks of treatment; 19 had minimal or no changes upon final examination., CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab can control the symptoms of severe COVID-19 by reducing the inflammatory response and rapidly improves the clinical status in most patients.	false
0	Head-to-head accuracy comparison of three commercial COVID-19 IgM/IgG serology rapid tests. Background: Comparative data of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is scarce. We thus performed a head-to-head comparison of three RDTs. Method(s): In this unmatched case-control study, blood samples from 41 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 50 negative controls were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of three commercially available COVID-19 RDTs: NTBIO (RDT-A), Orient-Gene (RDT-B), and MEDsan (RDT-C), against both a recombinant spike-expressing immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) and Euroimmun IgG ELISA, was assessed. RDT results concordant with the reference methods, and between whole blood and plasma, were established by the Kendall coefficient. Result(s): COVID-19 cases' median time from RT-PCR to serology was 22 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13-31 days). Whole-blood IgG detection with RDT-A,-B, and-C showed 0.93, 0.83, and 0.98 concordance with rIFA. Against rIFA, RDT-A sensitivity (SN) was 92% (95% CI: 78-98) and specificity (SP) 100% (95% CI: 91-100), RDT-B showed 87% SN (95% CI: 72-95) and 98% SP (95% CI: 88-100), and RDT-C 100% SN (95% CI: 88-100) and 98% SP (95% CI: 88-100). Against ELISA, SN and SP were above 90% for all three RDTs. Conclusion(s): RDT-A and RDT-C displayed IgG detection SN and SP above 90% in whole blood. These RDTs could be considered in the absence of routine diagnostic serology facilities.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Dynamic pharmacy leadership during the COVID-19 crisis: Optimizing patient care through formulary and drug shortage management. DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for health systems around the world. We describe our approach to adapting the pharmacy leadership structure to address critical medication shortages through innovative data analysis, procurement strategies, and rapid implementation of medication policy. SUMMARY: Yale New Haven Health deployed a system incident management command structure to effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis. System pharmacy services adopted a similar framework to enable efficient communication and quick decision-making in key domains, including drug procurement and policy. By refining a model to project health-system medication needs, we were able to anticipate challenges and devise alternative treatment algorithms. By leveraging big data and creating a system knowledge base, we were able to consolidate reporting and coordinate efforts to ensure system success. Various procurement strategies were employed to ensure adequate supply, including frequent communication with our wholesaler, sourcing direct from suppliers, outsourcing of sterile products compounding to registered 503B outsourcing facilities, and acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredients for compounding of essential medications. Strategic positioning of pharmacists within the health system's incident command response teams and rapid adaption of drug use policy governance fueled accelerated response and nimble implementation. Communication was streamlined and executed via multiple outlets to reach a broad audience across the health system. CONCLUSION(S): With medication shortages posing a threat to patient care, dynamic pharmacy leadership proved essential to providing patient care at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. System alignment and the rapid adaption of the existing framework for drug shortage management and medication use policy were crucial to success in crisis response.Copyright © American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2020.

0	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the adult population in Bangladesh: a nationwide cross-sectional study. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has imposed threats on both physical and mental health since its outbreak. This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental health interventions during and beyond this pandemic.	false
0	A highly specific and sensitive serological assay detects SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in COVID-19 patients that correlate with neutralization. Objective The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic challenges national health systems and the global economy. Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Methods In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. Results The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R-2 = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%;N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; > 10 days after PCR-proven infection;N = 53) in serum. Conclusions With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination.	false
0	Awareness and Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Renal Transplant Recipients. The concerns generated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are having profound impact on solid organ transplantation (SOT). Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are currently the only measures available to contain COVID-19 in the general population and in more vulnerable recipients of any organ transplant. In this cross-sectional case control study from a patient survey undertaken in 2 transplant centers (TxC) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Italy, we aimed to appraise awareness of the NPI implemented by respective these governments. We have also evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on our kidney transplant (KT) recipients and a control group of kidney living donors (KLD). In our series, there were zero cases of COVID-19 among 111 KT recipients and 70 KLD of the control group. Demography, transplant type, immunosuppression regimes, and, importantly, the different COVID-19 prevalence in the 2 regions of the TxC did not appear to influence incidence of COVID-19 in our KT recipients. The absence of COVID-19 cases in our series was unexpected. Our findings suggest that awareness of NPI is associated with a successful containment of COVID-19 in vulnerable, immunosuppressed KT recipients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Pooling of coronavirus tests under unknown prevalence. Diagnostic testing for the novel coronavirus is an important tool to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby a number of probes are `pooled' (i.e. grouped), is known to increase the capacity for testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors are considered. The results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects.	false
0	Infectious Disease Modeling and Epidemic Response Measures Analysis Considering Asymptomatic Infection. Classical SIR dynamic model and its derivative improved model may not accurately describe the epidemic situation similar to COVID-19 with characteristics of relative long incubation period and a large number of asymptomatic infections. Based on the existing epidemic compartment model, a novel compartment dynamic model considering actual transmission path of the symptomatic and asymptomatic infected is presented. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are employed to conduct prediction of development of the epidemic. According to different epidemic response measures, i.e., mitigation measures, suppression measures, medical treatment, evolutionary trend of epidemic situation under the initial population distribution structure are discussed. Results show that the control effects of different response measures on the number of deaths depend on the timing of the implementation of the measures. For mitigation response measures, the timing of the implementation of the measures has no obvious effect on the final epidemic, while for suppression response measures, the effect of suppression response measures in the early stage of the epidemic is significantly better than that in the middle and late stage of the epidemic development. Furthermore, no matter which stage the epidemic is in, the improvement of medical treatment level will play an important role in effectively reducing mortality. This study provides useful enlightenment and decision-making reference for policy makers to choose appropriate epidemic prevention and response measures in practice.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 20191,2 and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic3. Vaccines are an essential countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here, we show that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was predominantly Th1, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (prime-only and prime-boost regimen) induced a balanced Th1/Th2 humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control animals. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and its comparison with influenza pneumonia. Objectives: To recognise clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia and its differences from influenza pneumonia. Method(s): 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. Result(s): The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic 'bat wing sign'. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. Conclusion(s): There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.Copyright © Belgian Society of Internal Medicine and Royal Belgian Society of Laboratory Medicine (2020).	false
0	"SARS-CoV-2 viral and serological testing when college campuses reopen - some practical considerations. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted universities across the United States to close campuses in Spring 2020. Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of two potentially useful control strategies based on testing: 1) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and 2) serological testing followed by an ""immune shield"" approach; i.e., low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The ""immune shield"" strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical and financial implications. The main non-pharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (e.g., capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (e.g., universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable."	false
0	Hepatitis A susceptibility parallels high COVID-19 mortality. The COVID-19 has become the biggest health problem of our century. We hypothesized that immunity against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) may provide protection from COVID- 19. As of June 10, 2020, the infection had spread to 213 countries, with 7.3 million people infected and 413,733 dead . We combined this data with the WHO's susceptibility classification on the prevalence of HAV in the world. We found a significant relationship between Covid 19 mortality and HAV susceptibility (p<0.001). If confirmed, the consequences of this simple discovery will be enormous.	false
0	Evolution of effective serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 by non-pharmaceutical interventions. Studies of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reported varying estimates of epidemiological parameters such as serial intervals and reproduction numbers. By compiling a unique line-list database of transmission pairs in mainland China, we demonstrated that serial intervals of COVID-19 have shortened substantially from a mean of 7.8 days to 2.6 days within a month. This change is driven by enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions, in particular case isolation. We also demonstrated that using real-time estimation of serial intervals allowing for variation over time would provide more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers, than by using conventional definition of fixed serial interval distributions. These findings are essential to improve the assessment of transmission dynamics, forecasting future incidence, and estimating the impact of control measures.	false
0	Preceding infection and risk of stroke: An old concept revived by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anecdotal reports and clinical observations have recently emerged suggesting a relationship between COVID-19 disease and stroke, highlighting the possibility that infected individuals may be more susceptible to cerebrovascular events. In this review we draw on emerging studies of the current pandemic and data from earlier, viral epidemics, to describe possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may influence the prevalence of stroke, with a focus on the thromboinflammatory pathways, which may be perturbed. Some of these potential mechanisms are not novel but are, in fact, long-standing hypotheses linking stroke with preceding infection that are yet to be confirmed. The current pandemic may present a renewed opportunity to better understand the relationship between infection and stroke and possible underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 World Stroke Organization.	false
0	Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 in Indian Children in the Initial Phase of the Pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric inpatients with COVID-19, early in the pandemic. METHOD(S): Clinical and laboratory profile and outcomes were studied for children (aged 1 month - 18 years) presenting between 1 April, 2020 and 20 May, 2020 with positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. RESULT(S): 50 children (56% male) with median (IQR) age of 6 (2-12) years were included. Majority (56%) were from families belonging to Kuppuswamy upper lower socioeconomic class. 45 (90%) had positive household contact, and 33 (66%) had overcrowding at home. 29 (58%) children were asymptomatic while 20 (40%) had mild symptoms. Fever, cough, and sore throat were the most common symptoms. High C-reactive protein levels were seen in 15 (30%) children. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION(S): The disease burden appears high in lower socio-economic group with majority having a positive household contact. Milder disease pattern in the pediatric age group is reiterated.	false
0	Relating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with incidence or mortality of COVID-19. The present Perspective examined the latest evidence on the association between the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the incidence/mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our critical appraisal from existing literature does not support discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in clinical practice as there is absence of solid evidence. However, we do recommend future research perspective in formulation and implementation of practice-changing guidelines.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Emergency accesses in Dermatology Department during the Covid-19 pandemic in a referral third level center in the north of Italy. During the lockdown period most planned visits have been postponed and the number of accesses to Emergency Department (ED) has dramatically reduced. The aim of our study is to analyze the impact of the lockdown on the number, type and severity of Dermatological ED diagnosis. We performed a retrospective review of all dermatological consultations in the ED of IRCSS San Matteo during the lockdown period in Italy (February 22nd - May third 2020) and compared them with those from the same period in 2019. We noticed a sharply reduction in the number of dermatological consultations requested in the ED: from 164 patients in 2019 to 33 in 2020. Some diagnostic categories showed a significant difference with a higher incidence of vasculopathic lesions (0.6% vs 12.1%, P<0.0001), urticarial rashes (8.5% vs 21.2%, P = 0.03) and scabies (3% vs 12.1%, P = 0.023). We observed an increase in the proportion of patients starting medications, before coming to the ED 26.2% in 2019 vs 66.7% in 2020 (P<0.001). Furthermore, we noticed a significant increase in the average complexity of cases presenting to the ED in 2020, as proven by the increased need for biopsies and systemic therapy.

0	Albumin-Modified Melanin-Silica Hybrid Nanoparticles Target Breast Cancer Cells via a SPARC-Dependent Mechanism. Bioconjugation of a recently developed photoacoustic nanoprobe, based on silica-templated eumelanin-silver hybrid nanoparticles (MelaSil_Ag-NPs), with human serum albumin (HSA) is disclosed herein as an efficient and practical strategy to improve photostability and to perform SPARC mediated internalization in breast cancer cells. Modification of NPs with HSA induced a slight viability decrease in breast cancer cells (HS578T) and normal breast cells (MCF10a) when incubated with HSA-NPs up to 100 mug/mL concentration for 72 h and a complete suppression of hemotoxicity for long incubation times. Uptake experiments with MelaSil_Ag-HSA NPs indicated very high and selective internalization via SPARC in HS578T (SPARC positive cells) but not in MCF10a (SPARC negative cells), as evaluated by using endocytosis inhibitors. The binding of SPARC to HSA was confirmed by Co-IP and Dot-blot assays. Additional studies were performed to analyze the interaction of MelaSil_Ag-HSA NPs with protein corona. Data showed a dramatic diminution of interacting proteins in HSA conjugated NPs compared to bare NPs. HSA-coated MelaSil_Ag-NPs are thus disclosed as a novel functional nanohybrid for potential photoacoustic imaging applications.

0	ACCORD: A Multicentre, Seamless, Phase 2 Adaptive Randomisation Platform Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Candidate Agents for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalised Patients: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised. ObjectivesStage 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate agents as add-on therapies to standard of care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in a screening stage.Stage 2: To confirm the efficacy of candidate agents selected on the basis of evidence from Stage 1 in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in an expansion stage.Trial designACCORD is a seamless, Phase 2, adaptive, randomised controlled platform study, designed to rapidly test candidate agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Designed as a master protocol with each candidate agent being included via its own sub-protocol, initially randomising equally between each candidate and a single contemporaneous SoC arm (which can adapt into 2:1). Candidate agents currently include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin. For each candidate a total of 60 patients will be recruited in Stage 1. If Stage 1 provides evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety the candidate will enter Stage 2 where a total of approximately 126 patients will be recruited into each study arm sub-protocol. Enrollees and outcomes will not be shared across the Stages; the endpoint, analysis and sample size for Stage 2 may be adjusted based on evidence from Stage 1. Additional arms may be added as new potential candidate agents are identified via candidate agent specific sub-protocols.ParticipantsThe study will include hospitalised adult patients (>= 18 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, that clinically meet Grades 3 (hospitalised - mild disease, no oxygen therapy), Grades 4 (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs) and 5 (hospitalised, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen) of the WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 9-point category ordinal scale.Participants will be recruited from England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.Intervention and comparatorComparator is current standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of COVID-19. Current candidate experimental arms include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin with others to be added over time. Bemcentinib could potentially reduce viral infection and blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; MEDI3506 is a clinic-ready anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat respiratory failure caused by COVID; acalabrutinib is a BTK inhibitor which is anti-viral and anti-inflammatory; zilucoplan is a complement C5 inhibitor which may block the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 and; nebulised heparin has been shown to bind with the spike protein. ACCORD is linked with the UK national COVID therapeutics task force to help prioritise candidate agents.Main outcomesTime to sustained clinical improvement of at least 2 points (from randomisation) on the WHO 9-point category ordinal scale, live discharge from the hospital, or considered fit for discharge (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the ordinal scale), whichever comes first, by Day 29 (this will also define the “responder” for the response rate analyses).RandomisationAn electronic randomization will be performed by Cenduit using Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation will be stratified by baseline severity grade. Randomisation will proceed with an equal allocation to each arm and a contemporaneous SoC arm (e.g. 1:1 if control and 1 experimental arm; 1:1:1 if two experimental candidate arms etc) but will be reviewed as the trial progresses and may be changed to 2:1 in favour of the candidate agents. Blinding (masking)The trial is open label and no blinding is currently planned in the study.Numbers to be randomised (sample size)This will be in the order of 60 patients per candidate agent for Stage 1, and 126 patients for Stage 2. However, sample size re-estimation may be considered after Stage 1. It is estimated that up to 1800 patients will participate in the overall study.Trial StatusMaster protocol version ACCORD-2-001 - Master Protocol (Amendment 1) 22(nd) April 2020, the trial has full regulatory approval and recruitment is ongoing in the bemcentinib (first patient recruited 6/5/2020), MEDI3506 (first patient recruited 19/5/2020), acalabrutinib (first patient recruited 20/5/2020) and zilucoplan (first patient recruited 19/5/2020) candidates (and SoC).

0	"A real-world disproportionality analysis of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) events for baricitinib. BACKGROUND: Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., METHODS: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)., RESULTS: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including ""herpes zoster"", ""oral herpes"" and ""herpes virus infection"" were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected. These data are consistent with routine clinical observations and suggest the importance of pharmacovigilance."	false
0	The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein increases infectivity in an ACE2 receptor dependent manner. The SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic has been reported to have a relatively low mutation rate. Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.	false
0	Preparation of the protein corona: How washing shapes the proteome and influences cellular uptake of nanocarriers. A protein coat, termed the protein corona, assembles around the nanocarriers' surface once it gets in contact with a biological environment. We show that the media used for the washing of protein corona can be crucial. This is true for the downstream analysis as well as for the pre-coating used in in vitro or in vivo. This has been widely overlooked so far. In this paper we focus on eight different washing media and analyze how they influence the composition of the hard protein corona of several nanocarriers incubated with human blood plasma and serum. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS analysis showed major differences in protein corona profiles when using diverse washing media. While plasma and serum proteins already have different complexities, each washing media changes the composition of proteins detected by downstream methods with different key proteins bound to the nanocarriers' surface. Furthermore, the protein structure of the most abundant blood proteins incubated in the different media was analyzed with nanoDSF. This also emphasized the importance of the washing media, which had a significant influence on the protein adsorption stability. Lastly, cell uptake experiments for HeLa and RAW 264.7 macrophages also indicated an influence of the washing media. In conclusion, picking a specific washing media is on the one hand an important factor for downstream detection of protein compositions and may on the other hand be used to deliberately tune the protein corona for pre-adsorbed proteins from complex protein compositions. This might further support a guided delivery of the nanocarrier to a desired location within a physiological environment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The successfully application of nanocarriers as drug delivery vehicles is currently hampered by a limited understanding of the nanocarriers' behavior in a complex biological environment. Once the nanocarrier comes into contact with blood plasma or serum, biomolecules rapidly adsorb onto their surface, covering the nanocarriers and forming a protein corona, which then dictates their biological identity. Analyzing the composition of this dynamic network of bound molecules, has already been shown to be influenced by various factors. However, the impact of the washing media used for the protein corona preparation has so far been neglected. In the present study, we demonstrate a quantitative influence of the washing media on the composition of the hard corona of different nanocarrier systems, which additionally affects protein stability and cellular uptake behavior.

0	Pandemic Superimposed on Epidemic: Covid-19 Disparities in Black Americans. Health and healthcare disparities are variances in the health of a population or the care rendered to a population. Disparities result in a disproportionately higher prevalence of disease or lower standard of care provided to the index group. Multiple theories exist regarding the genesis of this disturbing finding. The COVID-19 pandemic has had the unfortunate effect of amplifying health inequity in vulnerable populations. African Americans, who make up approximately 12% of the US population are reportedly being diagnosed with COVID-19 and dying at disproportionately higher rates. Viewed holistically, multiple factors are contributing to the perfect storm: 1) Limited availability of public testing, 2) A dramatic increase in low wage worker unemployment/health insurance loss especially in the service sector of the economy, 3) High rates of preexisting chronic disease states/reduced access to early healthcare and 4) Individual provider and structural healthcare system bias. Indeed, COVID-19 represents a pandemic superimposed on a historic epidemic of racial health inequity and healthcare disparities. Therapeutic solutions are not expected in the near term. Thus, identifying the genesis and magnitude of COVID-19's impact on African American communities is the requisite first step toward crafting an immediate well designed response. The mid and long term approach should incorporate population health based tactics and strategies. Copyright © 2020 National Medical Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	CT colonography's role in the COVID-19 pandemic: a safe(r), socially distanced total colon examination. PURPOSE: To describe the favorable procedural profile of CT colonography (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSION: Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance. CTC is an important option to utilize in the screening armamentarium to allow effective screening of average risk asymptomatic individuals in the COVID-19 era.	false
0	Vitamin D high doses supplementation could represent a promising alternative to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection. Although we lack enough evidence to justify supplementing with vitaminD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection, it is increasingly feasible that this hypothesis is valid. Two general underlying mechanisms should be considered. One would be the anti-infectious and immunomodulatory action that it exerts by improving intercellular barriers by stimulating innate immunity, as well as by modulating adaptive immunity. Also, vitaminD reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (INF-gamma). More recently, multiple pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated on the actions of vitaminD at the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory level with positive results in studies with influenza, coronavirus, and other respiratory infections. An inverse relationship between serum vitaminD levels and the prevalence of the respiratory infectious disease has been described. Of interest, another mechanistic approach responds to considering the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is exacerbated in COVID-19 infection because the virus binds to the enzyme ACE2, making more angiotensinII available to cause damage. VitaminD inhibits mediators of RAAS - present in all cells of the body - and by inhibiting ACE activity and increasing ACE2, it lowers angiotensinII levels. We present studies with proposals for recommended doses of vitaminD, and although a single guideline is not specified, the possible benefits are promising. Finally, the purpose of this review is to share this idea with health professionals to ignite the debate and call for critical reflection, so that it can contribute to the undertaking of more and better clinical designs to validate the benefits of using high doses of vitaminD for the benefit of public health and especially in times of crisis for COVID-19.

The ac corona discharge is the most widely-used technique for the neutralization of electric charges accumulated at the surface of insulating materials. The aim of this paper is to validate the possibility of obtaining robust optimum operating conditions for the neutralization of corona-charged polymer films using the design of experiments methodology combined with Taguchi approach. The study was made on a 70 mu m thick PP film and took into account four factors. The amplitude and the frequency of the ac high voltage applied to the neutralization electrodes were considered as “design” factors. The two “noise” factors were the grid voltage and grid current of the triode-type electrode system employed for the corona charging of the samples. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of these factors on the neutralization process. The results show that both “design” factors considered for this process had highly significant effects on the neutralization rate. Of the two “noise” factors, only the grid voltage was found to have a significant effect. The optimum conditions for the neutralization process can be predicted by the commercial software MODDE 8.0. The calculation of the signal/noise ratios, according to the Taguchi approach, gives the values of the voltage amplitude and frequency that ensure the robust neutralization process.	false
0	The COVID-19 Pandemic and Non-communicable Diseases-A Wake-up Call for Primary Health Care System Strengthening in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strengthening Primary Health Care Systems is the most effective policy response in low-and middle-income countries to protect against health emergencies, achieve universal health coverage, and promote health and wellbeing. Despite the Astana declaration on primary health care, respective investment is still insufficient in Sub-Sahara Africa. The SARS-CoV-2019 pandemic is a reminder that non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are increasingly prevalent in Sub-Sahara Africa, are closely interlinked to the burden of communicable diseases, exacerbating morbidity and mortality. Governments and donors should use the momentum created by the pandemic in a sustainable and effective way by pivoting health spending towards primary health care.	false
0	COVID-19 prevalence estimation by random sampling in population-optimal sample pooling under varying assumptions about true prevalence. Background The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases divided by population size is used as a coarse measurement for the burden of disease in a population. However, this fraction depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions, and many sources indicate that a large fraction of cases tend to go undetected. Methods Estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population can be made by random sampling and pooling of RT-PCR tests. Here I use simulations to explore how experiment sample size and degrees of sample pooling impact precision of prevalence estimates and potential for minimizing the total number of tests required to get individual-level diagnostic results. Results Sample pooling can greatly reduce the total number of tests required for prevalence estimation. In low-prevalence populations, it is theoretically possible to pool hundreds of samples with only marginal loss of precision. Even when the true prevalence is as high as 10% it can be appropriate to pool up to 15 samples. Sample pooling can be particularly beneficial when the test has imperfect specificity by providing more accurate estimates of the prevalence than an equal number of individual-level tests.

The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-based vaccines may be limited by proteolysis of the translated product due to anomalous protein folding. This may be the case for vaccines employing linear SARS-CoV-2 B-cell epitopes identified in previous studies since most of them participate in secondary structure formation. In contrast, we have employed a consensus of predictors for epitopic zones plus a structural filter for identifying 20 unstructured B-cell epitope-containing loops (uBCELs) in S, M, and N proteins. Phylogenetic comparison suggests epitope switching with respect to SARS-CoV in some of the identified uBCELs. Such events may be associated with the reported lack of serum cross-protection between the 2003 and 2019 pandemic strains. Incipient variability within a sample of 1639 SARS-CoV-2 isolates was also detected for 10 uBCELs which could cause vaccine failure. Intermediate stages of the putative epitope switch events were observed in bat coronaviruses in which additive mutational processes possibly facilitating evasion of the bat immune system appear to have taken place prior to transfer to humans. While there was some overlap between uBCELs and previously validated SARS-CoV B-cell epitopes, multiple uBCELs had not been identified in prior studies. Overall, these uBCELs may facilitate the development of biomedical products for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 are distinct in children with MIS-C compared to adults with COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.	false
0	A survey on the frequency of COVID-19-like symptoms on students and staff of the University of Milan. A survey was conducted through a web link on the students and staff of the Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy in the period 14-30 April 2020. It was anonymous at the source and included history of COVID-19-related questions (fever, headache, cold, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal complaints and separately fever over 38.5degreeC) in the previous three weeks, and similar information on cohabitants. A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5degreeC; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5degreeC was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases. This has implications for the prevention, management and mortality of other serious diseases, including cancer.	false
0	Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symptom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p & 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF., CONCLUSIONS: These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.

0	Endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19: a position paper of the ESC Working Group for Atherosclerosis and Vascular Biology, and the ESC Council of Basic Cardiovascular Science. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented healthcare emergency causing mortality and illness across the world. Although primarily affecting the lungs, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also affects the cardiovascular system. In addition to cardiac effects, e.g. myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial damage, the vasculature is affected in COVID-19, both directly by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and indirectly as a result of a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm. This includes the role of the vascular endothelium in the recruitment of inflammatory leucocytes where they contribute to tissue damage and cytokine release, which are key drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. There is also evidence linking endothelial cells (ECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (i) the expression and function of its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the vasculature; (ii) the prevalence of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (vasculitis) in COVID-19; and (iii) evidence of EC infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with fatal COVID-19. Here, the Working Group on Atherosclerosis and Vascular Biology together with the Council of Basic Cardiovascular Science of the European Society of Cardiology provide a Position Statement on the importance of the endothelium in the underlying pathophysiology behind the clinical presentation in COVID-19 and identify key questions for future research to address. We propose that endothelial biomarkers and tests of function (e.g. flow-mediated dilatation) should be evaluated for their usefulness in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. A better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial biology in both the micro- and macrovasculature is required, and endothelial function testing should be considered in the follow-up of convalescent COVID-19 patients for early detection of long-term cardiovascular complications.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping the world with strong infectivity and high mortality, but by now, we still lack specific treatment. The leading cause of death from COVID-19 is failure to eliminate those viruses effectively. Cellular immunity plays a crucial role in the body's elimination of coronavirus, so it is necessary to study cellular immunity on the basis of plasma therapy. Blood components of convalescents without erythrocytes contains all the components of cellular immunity and humoral immunity in blood. Current studies had shown that all neutrophils, specific antibodies, interferons, platelets, specific effect cells and memory cells, play irreplaceable roles in the immune process of eradicating coronavirus. This article summarizes the infusion safety, therapeutic mechanism of all above components, and their effects on immunologic derangement and excessive inflammatory response, in order to provide an alternative reference for the treatment of COVID-19.	false
0	(Coagulopathy accompanying severe forms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) - incidence of thrombotic complications, how to prevent and treat them). COVID-19 coronavirus infection has a number of clinical manifestations. More serious course is accompanied by hypercoagulation status and endothelial damage, with a higher risk of venous thrombotic and thrombo- embolic complications (VTE). These complications significantly increase the risk of death. The incidence of VTE at COVID-19 differs in subpopulations, could be present in a quarter to a third of hospi- talized patients. Conversely, thrombotic events in the arterial bed (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or peripheral embolism) occur in about 5% of patients with a serious course. In the pathogenesis of thrombo- embolic disease many factors are involved - inflammation, i.e. release of a number of prothrombotic acute phase reactants (e.g. C -reactive protein, fi brinogen) and platelet activation, as well as damage of the endo- thelial lining usual in viral infection and inserted catheters, along with slowing flow during bed rest. In the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction or ischemic strokes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, damage of the endothelium and the deeper layers of the artery wall is likely to be dominantly affected. The importance of thrombotic complications on the course and prognosis of coronavirus infection is also evidenced by the large negative significance of the presence of fibrin degradation products, especially D-dimers.	false
0	Promising insights into the kosmotropic effect of magnetic nanoparticles on proteins: the pivotal role of protein corona formation. Increasing concerns about biosafety of nanoparticles (NPs), has raised the need for detailed knowledge of NP interactions with biological molecules especially proteins. Herein, the concentration-dependent effect of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was explored. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were employed to characterize MNPs synthesized through co-precipitation method. Then, we studied the behavior of two model proteins with different surface charges and structural properties on interaction with Fe3 O4 . A thorough investigation of protein-MNP interaction by the help of intrinsic fluorescence at different experimental conditions, revealed that affinity of proteins for MNPs is strongly affected by the similarity of protein and MNP surface charges. MNPs exerted structure-making kosmotropic effect on both proteins under a concentration threshold, however, binding strength was found to determine the extent of stabilizing effect as well as magnitude of the concentration threshold. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that proteins with less resistance to conformational deformations are more prone to secondary structure changes upon adsorption on MNPs. By screening thermal aggregation of proteins in the presence of Fe3 O4 , it was also found that like chemical stability, thermal stability is influenced to a higher extent in more strongly bound proteins. Overall, this report not only provides an integrated picture of protein-MNP interaction but also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underling this process. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Perfecting detection through education. Introduction: Radiologists' image reading skills vary, such variations in image interpretations can influence the effectiveness of the early treatment of disease and may have important clinical and economic implications. In screening mammography, clinical audits are used to assess radiologists' performance annually, however, the nature of these audits prevent robust data analysis due to the low prevalence of breast cancer and the long waiting periods for the audit results. Research-based evidence revealed a need for changes in the methods utilised to optimise the assessment of the efficacy of radiologists' interpretations. Method(s): A cloud-based platform was developed to assess and enhance radiologists' performance help reduce variability in medical image interpretations in a research environment; however, to address a number of limitations, the platform was commercialised to make it available worldwide. Result(s): DetectED-X's team have been able to make their cloud-based platform available worldwide, tailored to the needs of radiologists and accredited for continuing medical/professional education; thus, changing the continuous professional development practice globally. Conclusion(s): DetectED-X's Rivelato, was developed to address a need for effective, available and affordable educational solutions for clinicians and health care workers wherever they are located. A true fusion of industry, academia, clinics and consumer to adapt to the growing needs of clinicians' around the world, the latest being COVID-19 global pandemic. DetectED-X repurposed its platform to educate physicians around the world on the appearances of COVID-19 on Lung Computed Tomography scans, introducing CovED to clinicians worldwide free of charge as a multi-national consortium of collaboration to help fight COVID-19, showing how research-based evidence can create effective and scalable change globally.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers	false
0	Diagnostic considerations for COVID-19 in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. SARS-CoV-2 in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients is associated with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and higher mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection is definitively diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) typically using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and less commonly, samples from the lower respiratory tract, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In highly prevalent regions, stepwise evaluation, and management, as in the pre-COVID era, risks false-negatives and delay in therapy for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Thromboprophylaxis: balancing evidence and experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. A common and potent consideration has recently entered the landscape of the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19): venous thromboembolism (VTE). COVID-19 has been associated to a distinctive related coagulopathy that shows unique characteristics. The research community has risen to the challenges posed by this <> and has made unprecedented efforts to promptly address its distinct characteristics. In such difficult time, both national and international societies of thrombosis and hemostasis released prompt and timely responses to guide recognition and management of COVID-19-related coagulopathy. However, latest guidelines released by the international Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) on May 27, 2020, followed the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) on June 2, 2020 showed some discrepancies regarding thromboprophylaxis use. In this forum article, we would like to offer an updated focus on thromboprophylaxis with current incidence of VTE in ICU and non-ICU patients according to recent published studies; highlight the main differences regarding ISTH and CHEST guidelines; summarize and describe which are the key ongoing RCTs testing different anticoagulation strategies in patients with COVID-19; and finally set a proposal for COVID-19 coagulopathy specific risk factors and dedicated trials.	false

OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronaviruses disease (COVID-2019) in areas with epidemics due to imported cases is a cause of concern in China; however, few studies have reported on the prevalence of COVID-19 in these areas., METHODS: The number of diagnosed cases in Fujian Province was collected, and the time distribution of these cases was analyzed., RESULTS: The results showed that the COVID-19 prevalence in areas with epidemics due to imported cases could be divided into two stages. The first stage was an outbreak dominated by imported cases, with the data showing an obviously skewed distribution. The second stage was dominated by nonimported cases with sporadic and low-level fluctuations. Moreover, the data demonstrated that the ratio of unexplained infections to nonimported cases was increasing., CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage outbreak in areas with epidemics due to imported cases, effective control of the ""source of infection"" and blocking of the transmission route can significantly minimize the peak height in the first stage and the spread of the epidemic in the second stage. Control of the epidemic in the second stage requires prevention and control of the aggregation of cases caused by unexplained infections."	false
0	MADVent: A low-cost ventilator for patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced critical shortages of ventilators worldwide. There is an unmet need for rapidly deployable, emergency-use ventilators with sufficient functionality to manage COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we show the development and validation of a simple, portable and low-cost ventilator that may be rapidly manufactured with minimal susceptibility to supply chain disruptions. This single-mode continuous, mandatory, closed-loop, pressure-controlled, time-terminated emergency ventilator offers robust safety and functionality absent in existing solutions to the ventilator shortage. Validated using certified test lungs over a wide range of compliances, pressures, volumes and resistances to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards of safety and efficacy, an Emergency Use Authorization is in review for this system. This emergency ventilator could eliminate controversial ventilator rationing or splitting to serve multiple patients. All design and validation information is provided to facilitate ventilator production even in resource-limited settings.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Treatment algorithm for COVID-19: a multidisciplinary point of view. The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly, from December to the end of March, to 185 countries, and there have been over 3,000,000 cases identified and over 200,000 deaths. For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection. No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series. Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19. Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach. Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients. We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points* Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.* No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.* A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.* Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally having a profound effect on lives of millions of people, causing worldwide economic disruption. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.

0	ADHD as a Risk Factor for Infection With Covid-19. Background: ADHD limits the ability to comply with Covid-19 prevention recommendations. We hypothesized that ADHD constitutes a risk factor for Covid-19 infection and that pharmacotherapy may lower that risk. Methods: Study population included all subjects (N = 14,022) registered with Leumit Health Services between February 1st and April 30, 2020, who underwent at least one Covid-19 test. Data were collected from the electronic health records. Purchasing consecutively at least three ADHD-medication-prescriptions during past year was considered drug-treatment. Results: A total of 1,416 (10.1%) subjects (aged 2 months-103 years) were Covid-19-positive. They were significantly younger, and had higher rates of ADHD (adjOR 1.58 (95% CI 1.27-1.96, p < .001) than Covid-19-negative subjects. The risk for Covid-19-Positive was higher in untreated-ADHD subjects compared to non-ADHD subjects [crudeOR 1.61 (95% CI 1.36-1.89, p < .001)], while no higher risk was detected in treated ones [crudeOR 1.07 (95% CI 0.78-1.48, p = .65)]. Conclusion:  Untreated ADHD seems to constitute a risk factor for Covid-19 infection while drug-treatment ameliorates this effect.	false
0	Global seasonality of human seasonal coronaviruses: a clue for post-pandemic circulating season of SARS-CoV-2 virus?. BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus could recur as seasonal outbreaks, a circulating pattern observed among other pre-existing human seasonal coronaviruses (sCoV). However, little is known about seasonality of sCoV on a global scale., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of data on seasonality of sCoV. We compared seasonality of sCoV with influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We modelled monthly activity of sCoV using site-specific weather data., RESULTS: We included sCoV seasonality data in 40 sites from 21 countries. SCoV was prevalent in winter months in most temperate sites except for China while sCoV tended to be less seasonal in China and in tropical sites. In temperate sites excluding China, 53.1% of annual sCoV cases (Interquartile range, IQR: 34.6-61.9) occurred during influenza season and 49.6% (IQR: 30.2-60.2) of sCoV occurred during respiratory syncytial virus season. Low temperature combined with high relative humidity was associated with higher sCoV activity., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that provides an overview of the global seasonality of sCoV. Our findings offer clues to the possible post-pandemic circulating season of SARS-CoV-2 and add to the knowledge pool necessary for post-pandemic preparedness for SARS-CoV-2.

0	Pharmaco-Immunomodulatory Therapy in COVID-19. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness is a syndrome of viral replication in concert with a host inflammatory response. The cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses may play an equally important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival. Immune modulators have the potential to inhibit cytokines and treat the cytokine storm. A literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through 8 July 2020 using the search terms 'coronavirus', 'immunology', 'cytokine storm', 'immunomodulators', 'pharmacology', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome 2', 'SARS-CoV-2', and 'COVID-19'. Specific immune modulators include anti-cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib, ruxolitinib), anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (e.g. adalimumab, infliximab), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (e.g. gimsilumab, lenzilumab, namilumab), and convalescent plasma, with promising to negative trials and other data. Non-specific immune modulators include human immunoglobulin, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, interferons, statins, angiotensin pathway modulators, macrolides (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin), hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, colchicine, and prostaglandin D2 modulators such as ramatroban. Dexamethasone 6 mg once daily (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days may result in a reduction in mortality in COVID-19 patients by one-third for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those receiving oxygen. Research efforts should focus not only on the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also on the optimal timing of such interventions to maximize therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we discuss the potential role and safety of these agents in the management of severe COVID-19, and their impact on survival and clinical symptoms.	false
0	The contribution of pre-symptomatic infection to the transmission dynamics of COVID-2019. Background: Pre-symptomatic transmission can be a key determinant of the effectiveness of containment and mitigation strategies for infectious diseases, particularly if interventions rely on syndromic case finding. For COVID-19, infections in the absence of apparent symptoms have been reported frequently alongside circumstantial evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. We estimated the potential contribution of pre-symptomatic cases to COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Using the probability for symptom onset on a given day inferred from the incubation period, we attributed the serial interval reported from Shenzen, China, into likely pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. We used the serial interval derived for cases isolated more than 6 days after symptom onset as the no active case finding scenario and the unrestricted serial interval as the active case finding scenario. We reported the estimate assuming no correlation between the incubation period and the serial interval alongside a range indicating alternative assumptions of positive and negative correlation. Results: We estimated that 23% (range accounting for correlation: 12 - 28%) of transmissions in Shenzen may have originated from pre-symptomatic infections. Through accelerated case isolation following symptom onset, this percentage increased to 46% (21 - 46%), implying that about 35% of secondary infections among symptomatic cases have been prevented. These results were robust to using reported incubation periods and serial intervals from other settings. Conclusions: Pre-symptomatic transmission may be essential to consider for containment and mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Copyright: © 2020 Liu Y et al.	false

0	Rapid Decline in Telestroke Consults in the Setting of COVID-19. Background and Purpose: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global pandemic, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that incidence of diseases that require emergent care, particularly myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, has declined rapidly. The objective of this study is to quantify our experience of telestroke (TS) consults at a large tertiary comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed TS consults of patients presenting to our neuroscience network. Those with a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemia attack were included. Data were compared from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, which include consults prepandemic and during the crisis. Result(s): A total of 1,982 TS consults were provided in 1 year. Prepandemic, the mean monthly consults were 148. In April 2020, only 59 patients were seen (49% decline). Mobile stroke unit consults decreased by 72% in the same month. The 30-day moving average of patients seen per day was between five and six prepandemic declined to between two and three in April, and then began to uptrend during May. The mean percentage of patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was 16% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 31% in April 2020. The mean percentage of patients receiving endovascular therapy was 10% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 19% in April 2020. Conclusion(s): At our large tertiary comprehensive stroke center, we observed a significant and rapid decline in TS consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain of the reasons for the decline, but a fear of contracting coronavirus, social distancing, and isolation likely played a major role. Further research must be done to elucidate the etiology of this decline.	false
0	The cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: What did we learn from it?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first major global public health crisis of the 21st century. In March 2003, we reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) the discovery of a novel coronavirus (CoV) responsible for this newly emerged disease. SARS first emerged in Guangdong, China in November 2002, leading to major outbreaks in the Provincial capital Guangzhou in January. We first heard about these outbreaks in mid-February 2003. Hong Kong set up enhanced surveillance for all patients with severe pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Hong Kong, especially those with a travel history to Guangdong. Our investigation for known respiratory pathogens proved negative. We then started to look more broadly for unusual viruses, including attempting virus culture using a range of cell lines not normally used for respiratory viruses, broad-range PCR/RT-PCR, random primer RT-PCR methods as well as electron microscopy of a lung biopsy from a suspected patient. By March 17, 2003, we began to see subtle changes in FRhk 4 monkey kidney cells inoculated with specimens from two suspected patients. By electron microscopy, we could see virus particles within these cells and we then used fixed infected cells to demonstrate antibody responses in paired sera from a number of suspected SARS patients but not in controls. Using random RT-PCR, we were able to identify the virus as a novel coronavirus. The initial short RNA sequence of 646 nucleotides obtained from the random RT-PCR rapidly allowed the development of RT-PCR assays for detecting SARS patients (1). All these findings were shared in real-time via daily teleconferences organized by the WHO to link up laboratories working on this outbreak. Two other laboratories within the network (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg) reported similar findings from other SARS patients but others were still arguing for other aetiologies (e.g., human metapneumovirus).

Observational evidence suggests that excessive inflammation with cytokine storm may play a critical role in development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19. We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based upon clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (> 100 pg/mL) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (4 on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/mL and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/mL to 3.32 and 116 pg/mL respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also declined from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62 respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging. A multicenter clinical trial is underway with a FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption to evaluate the potential of SCD therapy to effectively treat COVID-19 ICU patients.	false
0	Risk factors and symptoms stratification and mortality of COVID-19 in population of Nowshera (Pakistan). Background & Objectives: COVID-19 has spread around the globe, and our country is no exception. We have been actively observing and managing these patients and have recorded the salient features including risk factors, the presenting complaints and also the trends of mortality. We aimed to have risk factors stratification, prevalent symptoms at the time of presentation to the hospital and to determine factors contributing to mortality due to COVID-19 in population of Nowshera (Pakistan). Methodology: In this cross sectional study, 75 cases with returned PCR results were included from 15th February 2020 to 18th April 2020. Data were entered in a format in SPSS version 25, prepared in accordance with the objectives of the study. Result(s): Out of a total of 75 patients, 20 (26.67%) were females and 55 (73.33%) were males. The mean age was 36+/-18 y. Out of these, 29 (38.67%) patients were COVID-19 positive by PCR technique, and 46 (61.33%) were negative. The probability of virus detection was higher in male gender (OR = 1.5, Relative Risk (RR) = 1.2). A significant relation of viral infectivity was noted with history of travel to an epidemic area (p = 0.01 OR = 3.85, RR = 1.5) and history of contacts with COVID-19 infected person/s (p = 0.018, OR = 3. 5, RR = 2.3). A high mortality rate of 3/29 (10.34%) for positive COVID-19 cases was recorded. The probability of worse outcome in term of death in COVID-19 positive patients was (p = 0.5, OR = 2.1). Regarding symptoms selection; contact and travel history without any symptoms has a reliability index (RI) of 12/35 (34%) for infectivity. Cough, fever with shortness of breath (RI; 8/12(67%) for positive cases followed by fever and cough with RI of 6/10 (60%) cases etc. Sore throat (RI; 1/13(8%) and flue only (RI;0/3(0%) proved non-reliable symptoms. When plotted the survival graphs of COVID positive vs. COVID negative cases, a similar pattern was recorded that showed the mortality rate in the positive cases was not solely due to COVID-19, though being opportunistic infection, it would have contributed. We recorded refractory COVID-19 in 4/29 (13.79%) cases. Conclusion(s): We conclude that male gender with history of travel to an epidemic area and contact with COVID-19 patients are strong predisposing factors. Cough, fever with shortness of breath are reliable symptoms for COVID-19 in our suspects. COVID-19 being an opportunistic infection contributes to a higher mortality in respiratory and cardiac patients.Copyright © 2020 Faculty of Anaesthesia, Pain and Intensive Care, AFMS.

0	The Dilemma of Renal Involvement in COVID-19: A Systematic Review. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global health since December 2019. It has spread worldwide and is consuming healthcare resources rapidly. Published literature suggests that people with advanced age and comorbidities are affected more severely. It is crucial to uncover the underlying pathogenesis of acute kidney insufficiency in COVID-19 patients to understand better the reasoning behind the grave outcomes in these patients. In this review, we have included articles stating the prevalence and specific mortality rates of COVID-19 patients with acute kidney insufficiency. Our study included 1098 COVID-19 positive patients, of whom 66 (6%) developed acute kidney insufficiency and 62 patients died, showing a mortality rate of 94%. Patients with acute kidney insufficiency showed a more severe disease course, and these patients ended up more in intensive care units. Particular attention should be paid to those with already established kidney disease, such as chronic kidney disease, or renal transplant recipients, as these patients are already on immunosuppressive therapy. Our review focuses on the prevalence of acute kidney insufficiency in COVID-19 patients and mortality rates in this subset of patients. Copyright © 2020, Bajwa et al.	false
0	Pregnant women voice their concerns and birth expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. BACKGROUND: In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared to be a pandemic. While data suggests that COVID-19 is not associated with significant adverse health outcomes for pregnant women and newborns, the psychological impact on pregnant women is likely to be high., AIM: The aim was to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian pregnant women, especially regarding concerns and birth expectations., METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of pregnant women in Italy was conducted. Responses were analysed for all women and segregated into two groups depending on previous experience of pregnancy loss. Analysis of open text responses examined expectations and concerns before and after the onset of the pandemic., FINDINGS: Two hundred pregnant women responded to the first wave of the survey. Most (n=157, 78.5%) had other children and 100 (50.0%) had a previous history of perinatal loss. 'Joy' was the most prevalent emotion expressed before COVID-19 (126, 63.0% before vs 34, 17.0% after; p<0.05); fear was the most prevalent after (15, 7.5% before vs 98, 49.0% after; p<0.05). Positive constructs were prevalent before COVID-19, while negative ones were dominant after (p<0.05). Across the country, women were concerned about COVID-19 and a history of psychological disorders was significantly associated with higher concerns (p<0.05). A previous pregnancy loss did not influence women's concerns., CONCLUSIONS: Women's expectations and concerns regarding childbirth changed significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Women with a history of psychological disorders need particular attention as they seem to experience higher levels of concern. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

0	Immune Parameters and COVID-19 Infection - Associations With Clinical Severity and Disease Prognosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) represents one of the most studied infectious diseases of today. The number of scientific reports and publications increases exponentially day by day. While the majority of infected subjects are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, there is an important proportion of patients who requires hospitalization and, sometimes, intensive care. Immune response to novel coronavirus is complex, involves both innate and adaptive immunity, and is biphasic. Significant differences were observed when comparing severe and non-severe patients. Analysis of the reported results from clinical trials clearly show an involvement of specific cellular immunity (predominantly leucopenia, decreased counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes, changes of T cell compartment) and the so-called cytokine storm, which is associated with worsening of symptoms and the promotion of lung damage. An interesting finding regarding eosinopenia that can have both diagnostic and prognostic value is reported by some authors. Examination of selected immune parameters could help to identify severe patients with the risk of unfavorable course of the disease, predict the prognosis and recognize improvement in the clinical status. Moreover, detailed analysis of the immune changes could help to select novel prospective therapeutic strategies.

0	What HIV in the brain can teach us about SARS-CoV-2 neurologic complications?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19, a disease that as of July 10, 2020, has infected over 12 million people and killed over 500,000. COVID-19 infection leads to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in a subset of patients and is a primary driver of acute morbidity in infected persons. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives dysfunction and pathology outside the lungs, including reports of renal, cardiac and neurological complications. Here, we summarize the known incidence and evidence of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other pathogenic coronaviruses. These studies describe a poorly understood spectrum of COVID-19 CNS symptoms, ranging from common and subclinical issues such as anosmia and headache to more concerning reports of stroke and encephalopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, including a discussion of how the understanding of neurological complications known to occur in HIV-1 patients may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 associated neurologic manifestations. Specifically, three hypotheses are discussed which are informed by decades of knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in the brain, which include a potential direct viral effect, an indirect viral effect, and/or a neuroimmune axis effect. Individually or in combination these potential effects may contribute to COVID-19 neurologic complications.	false
0	"Semantic and Geographical Analysis of COVID-19 Trials Reveals a Fragmented Clinical Research Landscape Likely to Impair Informativeness. Background: The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on modern society has ignited a ""gold rush"" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of economic, scientific, and human resources toward dedicated clinical research. We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods: We developed an online repository (COVID Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time the growth rate, geographical distribution, and characteristics of COVID-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints, and study designs. Analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT. Results: We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions: This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth casts doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable results. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for COVID-19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs. COVID Trial Monitor identifies critical issues in current COVID-19-related clinical research and represents a useful resource with which researchers and policymakers can improve the quality and efficiency of related trials.

0	VariplexTM test system fails to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 directly from respiratory samples without RNA extraction. Diagnosis of COVID is performed by PCR methods, but their capacity is limited by the requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has been utilized for the detection of isolated virus-specific RNA. Preliminary data suggest the possibility of isothermal amplification directly from respiratory samples without RNA extraction. All patients admitted to our hospital were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by routine. Respiratory samples were tested by variplex system based on LAMP method directly without RNA extraction and by PCR. Primary endpoint was the false-negative rate of variplex test compared with PCR as gold standard. In 109 patients variplex test and PCR assay were performed simultaneously. Median age was 80 years and male/female ratio was 40/60%. The prevalence of PCR-confirmed COVID diagnosis was 43.1%. Variplex test was positive in 13.8%. False-negative rate of variplex test compared with PCR was 83.0%. The potential of LAMP technology using isolated RNA has been demonstrated impressively by others, and excellent sensitivity and specificity of detecting SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. However, without RNA extraction, the variplex test system failed to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 directly in respiratory samples.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Selenium deficiency is associated with mortality risk from COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infections underlie the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and are causative for a high death toll particularly among elderly subjects and those with comorbidities. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element of high importance for human health and particularly for a well-balanced immune response. The mortality risk from a severe disease like sepsis or polytrauma is inversely related to Se status. We hypothesized that this relation also applies to COVID-19. Serum samples (n = 166) from COVID-19 patients (n = 33) were collected consecutively and analyzed for total Se by X-ray fluorescence and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) by a validated ELISA. Both biomarkers showed the expected strong correlation (r = 0.7758, p < 0.001), pointing to an insufficient Se availability for optimal selenoprotein expression. In comparison with reference data from a European cross-sectional analysis (EPIC, n = 1915), the patients showed a pronounced deficit in total serum Se (mean +/- SD, 50.8 +/- 15.7 vs. 84.4 +/- 23.4 micro g/L) and SELENOP (3.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.0 mg/L) concentrations. A Se status below the 2.5th percentile of the reference population, i.e., [Se] < 45.7 micro g/L and [SELENOP] < 2.56 mg/L, was present in 43.4% and 39.2% of COVID samples, respectively. The Se status was significantly higher in samples from surviving COVID patients as compared with non-survivors (Se; 53.3 +/- 16.2 vs. 40.8 +/- 8.1 micro g/L, SELENOP; 3.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 mg/L), recovering with time in survivors while remaining low or even declining in non-survivors. We conclude that Se status analysis in COVID patients provides diagnostic information. However, causality remains unknown due to the observational nature of this study. Nevertheless, the findings strengthen the notion of a relevant role of Se for COVID convalescence and support the discussion on adjuvant Se supplementation in severely diseased and Se-deficient patients.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Evidence for strong mutation bias towards, and selection against, U content in SARS-CoV-2: implications for vaccine design. Large-scale re-engineering of synonymous sites is a promising strategy to generate vaccines either through synthesis of attenuated viruses or via codon optimized genes in DNA vaccines. Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Consensus on recommendations for safe sexual activity during the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Sexual activity offers numerous advantages for physical and mental health but maintains inherent risks in a pandemic situation, such as the current one caused by SARS-CoV-2. A group of experts from the Spanish Association of Sexuality and Mental Health (AESexSAME) has reached a consensus on recommendations to maintain lower-risk sexual activity, depending on one's clinical and partner situations, based on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Different situations are included in the recommendations: a sexual partner passing quarantine without any symptoms, a sexual partner that has not passed quarantine, a sexual partner with some suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, a positive sexual partner with COVID-19, a pregnant sexual partner, a health professional partner in contact with COVID-19 patients, and people without a sexual partner. The main recommendations include returning to engaging in safe sex after quarantine is over (28 days based on the duration one can carry SARS-CoV-2, or 33 days for those who are >60 years old) and all parties are asymptomatic. In all other cases (for those under quarantine, those with some clinical symptoms, health professionals in contact with COVID-19 patients, and during pregnancy), abstaining from coital/oral/anal sex, substituting it with masturbatory or virtual sexual activity to provide maximum protection from the contagion, and increasing the benefits inherent to sexual activity are recommended. For persons without a partner, not initiating sexual activity with a sporadic partner is strongly recommended.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	The hazard of (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants in non-critically ill patients with Covid-19: the Padua province experience. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is responsible for a worldwide pandemic, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The increasing evidence of an associated relevant pro-thrombotic coagulopathy has resulted in an increasing use of antithrombotic doses higher than usual in COVID-19 patients. Information on the benefit/risk ratio of this approach is still lacking., OBJECTIVE: to assess the incidence of relevant bleeding complications in association with the antithrombotic strategy, and its relationship with the amount of drug., METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 were included in a retrospective analysis. Major bleedings (MB) and clinical relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) were obtained from patient medical records and were adjudicated by an independent committee., RESULTS: Of the 324 patients who were recruited, 240 had been treated with prophylactic doses and 84 with higher doses of anticoagulants. The rate of the composite endpoint of MB or CRNMB was 6.9 per 100 person/months in patients who had been given prophylactic doses, and 26.4 per 100 persons/months in those who had been prescribed higher doses (HR 3.89; 95%CI, 1.90 to 7.97). The corresponding rates for overall mortality were 12.2 and 20.1 per 100 person/months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The rate of relevant bleeding events were high in patients treated with (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. In the latter group, overall mortality did not differ from that of patients treated with standard prophylactic doses and was even higher. Our result does not support a strategy of giving (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Involvement of Spike Protein, Furin, and ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-Related Cardiovascular Complications. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global epidemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1(SARS-CoV-1). The S protein on the surface of the virus is cleaved by host proprotein convertases (PCs) to expose the active N-terminal S1 extracellular domain. Its receptors are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the C-terminal S2 membrane anchoring protein is responsible for translocating the virus into the cell. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and more than 7% of patients have suffered myocardial damage due to the infection, but the internal mechanism is still poorly understood. There is currently no specific and effective targeted treatment. Reduction of the patient's morbidity and mortality is an urgent problem that needs to be solved clinically. By exploring the theoretical analysis of PCs and ACE2 in COVID-19 cardiovascular susceptibility, some insights on how to prevent and alleviate adverse cardiovascular prognosis have been provided in this study.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	COVID-19 Outbreak Among College Students After a Spring Break Trip to Mexico - Austin, Texas, March 26-April 5, 2020. On March 27, 2020, a University of Texas at Austin student with cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On March 28, two more symptomatic students had positive test results, alerting the COVID-19 Center at the University of Texas Health Austin (UTHA) to a potential outbreak; the center initiated an outbreak investigation the same day. UTHA conducted contact tracing, which linked the students' infections to a spring break trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, during March 14-19. Among 231 persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 in this investigation, 64 (28%) had positive test results, including 60 (33%) of 183 Cabo San Lucas travelers, one of 13 (8%) household contacts of Cabo San Lucas travelers, and three (9%) of 35 community contacts of Cabo San Lucas travelers. Approximately one fifth of persons with positive test results were asymptomatic; no persons needed hospitalization, and none died. This COVID-19 outbreak among a young, healthy population with no or mild symptoms was controlled with a coordinated public health response that included rapid contact tracing and testing of all exposed persons. A coordinated response with contact tracing and testing of all contacts, including those who are asymptomatic, is important in controlling future COVID-19 outbreaks that might occur as schools and universities consider reopening.	false
0	COVID-19 Serological Tests: How Well Do They Actually Perform?. In only a few months after initial discovery in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have become a global pandemic causing significant mortality and morbidity and implementation of strict isolation measures. In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutics, reliable serological testing must be a key element of public health policy to control further spread of the disease and gradually remove quarantine measures. Serological diagnostic tests are being increasingly used to provide a broader understanding of COVID-19 incidence and to assess immunity status in the population. However, there are discrepancies between claimed and actual performance data for serological diagnostic tests on the market. In this study, we conducted a review of independent studies evaluating the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests. We found significant variability in the accuracy of marketed tests and highlight several lab-based and point-of-care rapid serological tests with high levels of performance. The findings of this review highlight the need for ongoing independent evaluations of commercialized COVID-19 diagnostic tests.	false
0	Microfluidic Immunoassays for Sensitive and Simultaneous Detection of IgG/IgM/Antigen of SARS-CoV-2 within 15 min. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is posing serious global public health problems. Facing the emergence of this pandemic, we established a portable microfluidic immunoassay system for easy-to-use, sensitive, rapid (<15 min), multiple, and on-site detection of IgG/IgM/Antigen of SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. This integrated method was successfully applied for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in clinical human serum as well as SARS-CoV-2 antigen in pharyngeal swabs from 26 patients with COVID-19 infection and 28 uninfected people. The assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, which is promising for the diagnosis and monitoring as well as control of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.	false
0	Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting in dysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 10 million people worldwide with mortality exceeding half a million patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age,hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Clear mechanistic understanding of how these comorbidities converge to enable severe infection is lacking. Notably each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome and this disruption may be a unifying feature of severe COVID-19. Here we provide the first in depth interrogation of lipidomic changes, including structural-lipids as well as the eicosanoids and docosanoids lipid mediators (LMs), that mark COVID-19 disease severity. Our data reveal that progression from moderate to severe disease is marked by a loss of specific immune regulatory LMs and increased pro-inflammatory species. Given the important immune regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into the immune balance in COVID-19 and potential targets for therapy with currently approved pharmaceuticals.	false
0	Objective sensory testing methods reveal a higher prevalence of olfactory loss in COVID-19 positive patients compared to subjective methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has currently infected over 6.5 million people worldwide. In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify the causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'smell', and/or 'olfaction'. We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID%[minus]19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss - subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli - to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.	false
0	COVID-19 and ENT surgery: a brief review of essential precautions and triage. PURPOSE: This study is a brief review of the existing knowledge on the ENT surgeon's approach towards management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is being recommended to carry out only the emergent procedures and to postpone the non-urgent ones to a later date, this article is meant to provide an insight into triage of the ENT procedures and the various precautions to be taken into account by the ENT surgeons while carrying out a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms 'COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery., RESULTS: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater., CONCLUSION: A proper knowledge of triage would be of immense help to the ENT surgeon in minimizing the exposure to health care workers and patients during this pandemic. All patients with an unknown COVID-19 status should be considered suspects and essential precautions for their management be taken accordingly.	false
0	Immune-mediated approaches against COVID-19. The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The long incubation period of this new virus, which is mostly asymptomatic yet contagious, is a key reason for its rapid spread across the world. Currently, there is no worldwide-approved treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, the clinical and scientific communities have joint efforts to reduce the severe impact of the outbreak. Research on previous emerging infectious diseases have created valuable knowledge that is being exploited for drug repurposing and accelerated vaccine development. Nevertheless, it is important to generate knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and its impact on host immunity, to guide the design of COVID-19 specific therapeutics and vaccines suitable for mass immunization. Nanoscale delivery systems are expected to play a paramount role in the success of these prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. This Review provides an overview of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and examines immune-mediated approaches currently explored for COVID-19 treatments, with an emphasis on nanotechnological tools.	false
0	The role of testing in infectious disease control: A case of COVID-19 in Africa. The dramatic increase in COVID-19 suspected cases in Africa has placed enormous burden on public and private clinical facilities. Till date, the most commonly used method for the identification and confirmation of the virus is the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Unfortunately, testing capacities have been limited in many parts of Africa because of inadequate test kits which have restricted scaling up beyond the few public health laboratories at designated locations. We present in this mini-review Africa's preparedness and readiness toward testing, why testing is crucial, the need to immediately strengthen existing facilities and what it involves as combined approaches for managing the COVID-19 crisis. The review highlights the urgent need for speedy expansion and distribution of several laboratory testing platforms to public health facilities and fully accredited private clinical laboratories, including real-time PCR and serological assays.

0	A Versatile Platform to Incorporate Viral Trimeric Antigens into Self-Assembling Nanoparticle Immunogens. Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens may be complicated by inefficiencies in their production, especially with the metastable glycosylated trimeric type 1 fusion machines that are prevalent viral vaccine targets. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N- linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. Respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer - stabilized in the prefusion conformation by multiple disulfides and fused with SpyCatcher - could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or to ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric antigens from viral respiratory pathogens, including the recently identified SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	COVID19 inhibitors: A prospective therapeutics. The inhibition of viral targets might provide new therapies for coronavirus disease abbreviated as COVID-19. The rational drug design identified as much of the recent discoveries of potent drugs molecule against any targets. This results in an improvement in bindings for better potency and selectivity. The drugs containing ethanolamine/propylamine fragments along with heterocycles have shown potential antiviral results. Similarly, there is the possibility of controlling the COVID-19 infection by nucleotide analogues. Here we also highlight drugs ACEIs/ARBs inhibitory discussing both their advantages and disadvantages. The class of compounds/antibodies inhibiting interleukin-6 works in antirheumatoid drugs are found useful in alleviating overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs of the patient. These inclusion based approaches counter some of the side-effects associated with the heterocycles and also potentiate the efficacy of the molecules. In this review article, design strategies for some of the drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2 are represented. The review also focuses on the listing of drugs that are currently testing under clinical trials for the COVID-19 virus with their mechanism of action. This conversation undertakes the opportunity to do a bit for the newer researchers working in this arena. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false

0	Association between detectable SARS-COV-2 RNA in anal swabs and disease severity in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was found in intestines and feces, but its clinical significance is not completely clear. We aim to characterize the longitudinal test results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs, and to explore the association with disease severity., METHODS: We included laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital and excluded those who had not received anal swabs for SARS-COV-2 RNA testing. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Throat swabs and anal swabs were collected periodically for SARS-COV-2 RNA detection., RESULTS: 217 eligible patients (median aged 50 years, 50.2% were females) were analyzed. 21.2% (46/217) of the patients were detectable for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs. The duration of viral RNA was longer, but the viral load was lower in anal swabs than throat swabs in the early stage of disease. During a median follow-up of 20 days, 30 (13.8%) patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxemia. Detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.20-5.24), increased CRP (aHR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.32) and lymphocytopenia (aHR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46-6.67) were independently associated with ICU admission. The cumulative incidence of ICU admission was higher among patients with detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (26.3% vs. 10.7%, P=0.006)., CONCLUSION: Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the digestive tract was a potential warning indicator of severe disease.

0	Effect of meteorological parameters on spread of COVID-19 in India and air quality during lockdown. The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. In India, it is already reported more than 855 thousand cases and more than 22 thousands deaths due to COVID-19 till July 12, 2020. The role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. In contrast, for the previous many viral infections like influenza, it is well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017-2019) for March, April and May months and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to May 31. We found a positive association between daily COVID-19 cases and temperature and a mixed association with relative and absolute humidity over India. We have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the lockdown period (25 March-31 May) in India. During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and NO2 reduced sharply with a maximum percentage drop of about 60 and 45, respectively. We have also found the reduction in surface PM2.5 PM10 and NO2 for the six mega cities of India during the lockdown period. Our results suggest that COVID-19 still may spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon, therefore an effective public health intervention should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Pulmonary embolism in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterised by dyspnoea and abnormal coagulation parameters, including raised D-dimer. Data suggests a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in ventilated patients with COVID-19. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and the diagnostic yield of Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for PE. We also examined the utility of D-dimer and conventional pre-test probability for diagnosis of PE in COVID-19. Patients/methods: Retrospective review of single-centre data of all CTPA studies in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 identified from Electronic Patient Records (EPR). Result(s): There were 1477 patients admitted with COVID-19 and 214 CTPA scans performed, of which n = 180 (84%) were requested outside of critical care. The diagnostic yield for PE was 37%. The overall proportion of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 5.4%. The proportions with Wells score of >=4 ('PE likely') was 33/134 (25%) without PE vs 20/80 (25%) with PE (P = 0.951). The median National Early Warning-2 (NEWS2) score (illness severity) was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-9) in PE group vs 4 (IQR 2-7) in those without PE (P = 0.133). D-dimer was higher in PE (median 8000 ng/mL; IQR 4665-8000 ng/mL) than non-PE (2060 ng/mL, IQR 1210-4410 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the 'low probability' group, D-dimer was higher (P < 0.001) in those with PE but had a limited role in excluding PE. Conclusion(s): Even outside of the critical care environment, PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is common. Of note, approaching half of PE events were diagnosed on hospital admission. More data are needed to identify an optimal diagnostic pathway in patients with COVID-19. Randomised controlled trials of intensified thromboprophylaxis are urgently needed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	The use of convalescent plasma as a novel treatment in pandemic disease: A review. At present, antibody-based therapies are undergoing a renaissance. In the wake of being created and afterward to a great extent relinquished in the twentieth century, many antibody preparations are presently in clinical use. Interest in utilizing antibodies to treat irresistible infections is now being fuelled by the wide dissemination of drug-resistant pathogens, the rise of new pathogens, the overall inefficacy of medications in immunocompromised hosts and the fact that antibody-based treatments are the main way to give prompt resistance against biological weapons. Given the requirement for new drug therapies and numerous ongoing innovative advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, there is generous affirmation concerning improved applications of antibody-based therapy for the anticipation and treatment of infectious diseases. The advent of new pathogens for which there is no compelling treatment alternative has redrawn the regard for the usefulness of convalescent plasma. To be sure, convalescent plasma can be an alternate and quick remedial choice in outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 flu, H5N1 flu, Ebola, Poleomyelitis, Measles and COVID-19.Copyright © Journal of Global Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false
0	Impact of lockdown measures implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic on the burden of trauma presentations to a regional emergency department in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented nationwide regulations aimed primarily at slowing the spread of the virus. The objective of this study was to describe the effect of these regulations on the number and severity of trauma presentations to a regional emergency department in Kwa-Zulu Natal. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of the triage register at Edendale Hospital Emergency Department was conducted, comparing all trauma presentations in the month of April 2020 with those from the preceding two years. The number of patients, mechanism of trauma and severity of illness were recorded and compared. Result(s): A 47% reduction in the number of trauma cases was recorded for April 2020. The proportion of severe cases did not change. The categories showing a major decrease were motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian vehicle accidents, assault and gunshot wounds. The incidence of dog bite wounds and burns remained unchanged. Conclusion(s): This study shows that the burden of trauma presenting to the emergency department was decreased in the month of April 2020 by the regulations implemented in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 African Federation for Emergency Medicine	false
0	Numbers of emergency room patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Since end of March, the health care system in Germany has been placed into a state of emergency in order to gain resources for the spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. Material(s) and Method(s): With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. Result(s): Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (-41%), wounds (-29%), thoracic (-24%) and abdominal pain (-23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency. Conclusion(s): In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed a significant decline in the number of patients in one of the largest emergency rooms in Munich. This has to be avoided with existing hospital capacities, in order to prevent potential damage to health caused by postponed or missing emergency presentations.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Why the elderly appear to be more severely affected by COVID-19: The potential role of immunosenescence and CMV. The significantly higher mortality rates seen in the elderly compared with young children during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is likely to be driven in part by an impaired immune response in older individuals. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence approaches 80% in the elderly. CMV has been shown to accelerate immune ageing by affecting peripheral blood T cell phenotypes and increasing inflammatory mediated cytokines such as IL-6. The elderly with pre-existing but clinically silent CMV infection may therefore be particularly susceptible to severe Covid-19 disease and succumb to a cytokine storm which may have been promoted by CMV. Here, we evaluate the potential role of CMV in those with severe Covid-19 disease and consider how this relationship can be investigated in current research studies. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 and arterial hypertension: Hypothesis or evidence?. Investigations reported that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were the most prevalent comorbidities among the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hypertension appeared consistently as the most prevalent risk factors in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and increased mortality in these patients. This raised concern about the potential association between hypertension (and its treatment) and propensity for COVID-19. There are only a few follow-up studies that investigated the impact of comorbidities on outcome in these patients with conflicting findings. Hypertension has been proven to be more prevalent in patients with an adverse outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of hypertension on mortality in COVID-19 patients. There are many speculations about this coronavirus and its relation with different risk factors and underlying diseases. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and COVID-19 and the role of hypertension on outcome in these patients.

0	COVID-19 and ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-summary of the literature. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a life-threatening complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Increasing reports suggest an association between COVID-19 and AIS, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. We performed a systematic review to characterize the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and outcomes of AIS in COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase using a suitable keyword search strategy from 1st December 2019 to 29th May 2020. All studies reporting AIS occurrence in COVID-19 patients were included. A total of 39 studies comprising 135 patients were studied. The pooled incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients from observational studies was 1.2% (54/4466) with a mean age of 63.4 +/- 13.1 years. The mean duration of AIS from COVID-19 symptoms onset was 10 +/- 8 days, and the mean NIHSS score was 19 +/- 8. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated mean D-dimer (9.2 +/- 14.8 mg/L) and fibrinogen (5.8 +/- 2.0 g/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in a significant number of cases. The majority of AIS neuroimaging patterns observed was large vessel thrombosis, embolism or stenosis (62.1%, 64/103), followed by multiple vascular territory (26.2%, 27/103). A high mortality rate was reported (38.0%, 49/129). We report the pooled incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients to be 1.2%, with a high mortality rate. Elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies appear to be prominent in COVID-19 patients with concomitant AIS, but further mechanistic studies are required to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.	false
0	Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project. BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear., METHOD: We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020., RESULTS: Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress., LIMITATIONS: Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified., CONCLUSIONS: Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.

0	Frequency and outcome of olfactory impairment and sinonasal involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has shown to accompany COVID-19. There are varying data regarding the exact frequency in the various study population. The outcome of the olfactory impairment is also not clearly defined., OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency of olfactory impairment and its outcome in hospitalized patients with positive swab test for COVID-19., METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, randomly sampled, from February to March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were analyzed according to the olfactory loss or sinonasal symptoms. The olfactory impairment and sinonasal symptoms were evaluated by 9 Likert scale questions asked from the patients., RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the follow-up (means 20.1 (+/- 7.42) days). Twenty-two (23.91%) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52%) patients olfactory loss was the first symptom of the disease. The olfactory loss was reported to be completely resolved in all but one patient. Thirty-nine (42.39%) patients had notable sinonasal symptoms while rhinorrhea was the first symptom in 3 (3.26%). Fifteen patients (16.3%) had a taste impairment. Patients with sinonasal symptoms had a lower age (p = 0.01). There was no significant relation between olfactory loss and sinonasal symptoms (p = 0.07)., CONCLUSIONS: Sudden olfactory dysfunction and sinonasal symptoms have a considerable prevalence in patients with COVID-19. No significant association was noted between the sinonasal symptoms and the olfactory loss, which may suggest that other mechanisms beyond upper respiratory tract involvement are responsible for the olfactory loss.	false
0	Clinical analysis of risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes. AIMS: To describe characteristics of COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes and to analyze risk factors for severity., METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes were collected and analyzed., RESULTS: Seventy-fourCOVID-19 patients with diabetes were included. Twenty-seven patients (36.5%) were severe and 10 patients (13.5%) died. Higher levels of blood glucose, serum amyloid A (SAA), C reactive protein and interleukin 6 were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe ones (P<0.05). Levels of albumin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, small and dense low density lipoprotein and CD4+T lymphocyte counts in severe patients were lower than those in non-severe patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified decreased CD4+T lymphocyte counts (odds ratio [OR]=0.988, 95%Confidence interval [95%CI] 0.979-0.997) and increased SAA levels (OR=1.029, 95%CI 1.002-1.058) as risk factors for severity of COVID-19 with diabetes (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients were more susceptible to COVID-19 than overall population, which might be associated with hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Aggressive treatment should be suggested, especially when these patients had low CD4+T lymphocyte counts and high SAA levels. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false

0	Real-time estimation of the reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China in 2020 based on incidence data. Background: Since the first appearance in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed serious threats to the public health in many Chinese places and overseas. It is essential to quantify the transmissibility on real-time basis for designing public health responses., Methods: We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in China, Hubei province and Wuhan city by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. We compare the average reproduction numbers in different periods of time to explore the effectiveness of the public health control measures against the COVID-19 epidemic., Results: We estimated the reproduction numbers at 2.61 (95% CI: 2.47-2.75), 2.76 (95% CI: 2.54-2.95) and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.43-3.01) for China, Hubei province and Wuhan respectively. We found that the reproduction number largely dropped after the city lockdown. As of February 16, the three reproduction numbers further reduced to 0.98, 1.14 and 1.41 respectively., Conclusions: The control of COVID-19 epidemic was effective in substantially reducing the disease transmissibility in terms of the reproduction number in China reduced to 0.98 as of February 16. At the same time, the reproduction number in Wuhan was probably still larger than 1, and thus the enhancement in the public health control was recommended to maintain.

0	Neutralizing Antibodies Targeting the Conserved Stem Region of Influenza Hemagglutinin. Influenza continues to be a public health threat despite the availability of annual vaccines. While vaccines are generally effective at inducing strain-specific immunity, they are sub-optimal or ineffective when drifted or novel pandemic strains arise due to sequence changes in the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). The discovery of a large number of antibodies targeting the highly conserved stem region of HAs that are capable of potently neutralizing a broad range of virus strains and subtypes suggests new ways to protect against influenza. The structural characterization of HA stem epitopes and broadly neutralizing antibody paratopes has enabled the design of novel proteins, mini-proteins, and peptides targeting the HA stem, thus providing a foundation for the design of new vaccines. In this narrative, we comprehensively review the current knowledge about stem-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies and the structural features contributing to virus neutralization.	false
0	Infectivity, virulence, pathogenicity, host-pathogen interactions of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 in experimental animals: a systematic review. The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China with subsequent human to human transmission worldwide had taken up the shape of a devastating pandemic. The ability of the virus to infect multiple species other than humans has currently been reported in experimental conditions. Non-human primates, felines, ferrets, rodents and host of other animals could previously be infected in experimental conditions with SARS-CoV and recently with SARS-CoV-2, both virus using Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry. The variations in sequence homology of ACE2 receptor across species is identified as one of the factors determining virulence and pathogenicity in animals. The infection in experimental animals with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 on most occasions are asymptomatic, however, the virus could multiply within the respiratory tract and extra-pulmonary organs in most of the species. Here, we discuss about the pathogenicity, transmission, variations in angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor-binding across species and host pathogen interactions of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory animals used in research.	false
0	Assessment of risk conferred by coding and regulatory variations of TMPRSS2 and CD26 in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. At present, more than 200 countries and territories are directly affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Incidence and case fatality rate are significantly higher among elderly individuals (age>60 years), type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients. Cellular receptor ACE2, serine protease TMPRSS2 and exopeptidase CD26 (also known as DPP4) are the three membrane bound proteins potentially implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesised that common variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 may play critical role in infection susceptibility of predisposed population or group of individuals. Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein-protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 50 UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.	false
0	The Relationship between Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 Prognosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Wuhan, China. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease, first appeared in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the world. We aimed to understand the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the prognosis of COVID-19., METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between diabetes (n=84) and non-diabetes (n=500) groups. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox analysis were applied to determine the risk factors for the prognosis of COVID-19., RESULTS: Compared to non-diabetic patients, diabetic patients had higher levels of neutrophils (p=0.014), c-reactive protein (p=0.008), procalcitonin (p < 0.01), and D-dimer (p=0.033), and lower levels of lymphocytes (p=0.032) and albumin (p=0.035). Furthermore, diabetic patients had a significant higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia (86.9%, p=0.020). In terms of complications and clinical outcomes, the incidence of respiratory failure (36.9% vs. 24.2%, p=0.022), acute cardiac injury (47.4% vs. 21.2%, p < 0.01) and death (20.2% vs. 8.0%, p=0.001) in the diabetes group was significantly higher than that in non-diabetes group. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that diabetes (HR 2.180, p=0.031) was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 prognosis. In subgroup analysis, we divided diabetic patients into insulin required and non-insulin required groups according to whether they needed insulin, and found that diabetic patients requiring insulin may have a higher risk of disease progression and worse prognosis after the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the prognosis of COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment for diabetic patients, especially those who require insulin therapy. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Frequency and severity of COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis: A short single-site report from northern Italy. Neurologists are interested in understanding whether patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) undergoing immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to developing COVID-19 or have worse outcomes. Currently, there are no conclusive data in this regard. We report the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 (confirmed and possible) in pwMS followed at the Veneto Regional MS Center in Verona (Italy), an area most stricken by COVID-19. In our sample size, the prevalence of COVID-19 seems to be much higher than that officially reported at the regional level on the general population, but it also characterized by a favourable course.

0	Declined serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection is epidemic worldwide. We describe the serum lipid profile of the patients with COVID-19 infection., METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected the first clinical laboratory data of 114 patients on admission, and 80 healthy controls. Meanwhile, we monitored the serum lipid profile, COVID-19 nucleic acid and chest CT scan of a severe patient from the early stage of infection to the recovery period for a total of 80 days., RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients had sharply decreased concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P<0.001). Among the patients, HDL-cholesterol concentration in severe groups was significantly lower than the common groups [1.01 (0.88-1.20) vs 1.21 (1.02-1.48) mmol/l, P<0.001]. The lipid profile of a severe patient showed that serum cholesterol concentration significantly decreased in the early stage and returned to be normal in the recovery period. Moreover, the change of HDL-cholesterol in this patient was consistent with the results of nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans. In correlation analysis, HDL-cholesterol concentration was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP, r=-0.396, P<0.001) and positively correlated with lymphocytes (r=0.336, P<0.001). The area under curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of HDL-cholesterol was 0.732 (P<0.001), and, the adjusted odd ratio (OR) of HDL-cholesterol was 0.023 (95% CI 0.002-0.227)., CONCLUSIONS: Decreased serum HDL-cholesterol is associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.

0	COVID-19 comorbidities, associated pro-coagulant extracellular vesicles and venous thromboembolisms: a possible link with ethnicity?. Several comorbidities predict mortality in patients with COVID-19, some of which are more prevalent in Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cells are nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles that carry nucleic acids and proteins and mediate intercellular communication. In COVID-19 associated comorbidities including diabetes, CVD and risk factors such as hypertension, elevated angiotensin II and obesity, levels of circulating EVs are raised and their cargo modified. Importantly, EVs released from damaged endothelial cells are known to be procoagulant. EVs in Black and White populations differentially express phosphorylated insulin signalling proteins, associated with impaired insulin signalling, insulin resistance and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism; these EV proteins are also associated with clinical mortality risk markers. If plasma EV levels are raised, and cargo modified in comorbidities associated with COVID-19 such as diabetes, and account for excess deaths in BAME patients, this raises the possibility for important roles of EVs, also relating to ethnicity. This places EVs as hitherto understudied key factors, filling the current knowledge gap in COVID-19, amongst BAME patients. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Serum Iron Level as a Potential Predictor of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Severity and Mortality: A Retrospective Study. Background: Various types of pulmonary diseases are associated with iron deficiency. However, information on iron status in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce., Methods: This study included 50 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The role of serum iron in predicting severity and mortality of COVID-19 was evaluated., Results: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients in this study were cough (82%), fever (64%), and chest distress (42%). Of the 50 patients, 45 (90%) patients had abnormally low serum iron levels (<7.8 mumol/L). The severity of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with serum iron levels before and after treatment and was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, urea nitrogen, and myoglobin levels. Decreased serum iron level could predict the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe and critical illness. Seven (53.8%) patients with a lower serum iron level after treatment in the critical group had died. There was a significant difference in posttreatment serum iron levels between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors., Conclusions: Serum iron deficiency was detected in the patients with COVID-19. The severity and mortality of the disease was closely correlated with serum iron levels. Low serum iron concentration was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients.

0	Group testing performance evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 massive scale screening and testing. BACKGROUND: The capacity of the current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in the current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population., METHODS: We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery., RESULTS: Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 15X-20X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans., CONCLUSION: Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to conventional group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.	false
0	A familial cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by one family member during his asymptomatic incubation period. An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread in the world, whereas asymptomatic carriers may also play a critical role in the pandemic. We report a familial cluster of COVID-19 caused by one family member before his onset of illness, indicating that it seems to be potentially infectious during the incubation period, even earlier than we expected. Close contact, especially in a small enclosed space, might be the cause of familial transmission. The unsynchronized changes in the clinical symptoms and COVID-19 nucleic acid were found in this case, so consecutive nucleic acid detection of pretty suspected cases was recommended. Family members, especially of whom the confirmed cases contacted with since one incubation period before onset rather than 2 days before onset, should be regarded as close contact and centrally isolated in case of asymptomatic infection already existed in the family.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Febrile Neonates. Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in pediatric patients are mild or asymptomatic. However, infants have emerged at higher risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes in pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case series of four full term neonates hospitalized with fever and found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection with a spectrum of illness severities. Two neonates required admission to the intensive care unit for respiratory insufficiency and end organ involvement. Half of the patients were found to have a co-infection. One neonate received antiviral therapy with remdesivir and is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient to receive this drug for COVID-19. All neonates had favorable outcomes.

0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 74 Patients With Severe or Critical COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a major concern and caused a pandemic globally. The goal of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of recovery and death in patients with severe or critical COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, clinical data were collected from 74 severe or critical COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Fourth Hospital between Jan. 25th and Feb. 26th, 2020. All patients were divided into a recovery group or a death group according to clinical outcomes, and the differences between the groups were compared., RESULTS: Of the 74 patients enrolled in the study, 48 (64.9%) were severe cases and 26 (35.1%) were critical cases. Sixty (81.1%) patients were recovered and 14 (18.9%) died. Compared with recovery patients, patients in the death group were older, and had higher incidences of hypertension, coronary disease and dyspnea at admission. Laboratory tests for lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer indicated higher levels in the death group. The PaO2:FiO2 ratio and minimum SpO2 were lower in the death group, and a higher proportion of these patients received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Patients with a low blood gas index and poor coagulation function at admission had a high mortality rate. For such patients, comprehensive treatment should be performed as soon as possible to improve the prognosis and reduce mortality. Copyright © 2020 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

0	Coronaviruses and Integrin alphavbeta3: Does Thyroid Hormone Modify the Relationship?. BACKGROUND: Uptake of coronaviruses by target cells involves binding of the virus by cell ectoenzymes. For the etiologic agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), a receptor has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recently it has been suggested that plasma membrane integrins may be involved in the internalization and replication of clinically important coronaviruses. For example, integrin alphavbeta3 is involved in the cell uptake of a model porcine enteric alpha-coronavirus that causes human epidemics. ACE2 modulates the intracellular signaling generated by integrins., OBJECTIVE: We propose that the cellular internalization of alphavbeta3 applies to uptake of coronaviruses bound to the integrin, and we evaluate the possibility that clinical host T4 may contribute to target cell uptake of coronavirus and to the consequence of cell uptake of the virus., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The viral binding domain of the integrin is near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-binding site and RGD molecules can affect virus binding. In this same locale on integrin alphavbeta3 is the receptor for thyroid hormone analogues, particularly, L-thyroxine (T4). By binding to the integrin, T4 has been shown to modulate the affinity of the integrin for other proteins, to control internalization of alphavbeta3 and to regulate the expression of a panel of cytokine genes, some of which are components of the 'cytokine storm' of viral infections. If T4 does influence coronavirus uptake by target cells, other thyroid hormone analogues, such as deaminated T4 and deaminated 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), are candidate agents to block the virus-relevant actions of T4 at integrin alphavbeta3 and possibly restrict virus uptake.	false
0	Basic reproduction number and predicted trends of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in the mainland of China. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a serious epidemic around the world, but it has been effectively controlled in the mainland of China. The Chinese government limited the migration of people almost from all walks of life. Medical workers have rushed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic. Any activity that can increase infection is prohibited. The aim of this study was to confirm that timely lockdown, large-scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China., METHODS: Based on disease transmission-related parameters, this study was designed to predict the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in the mainland of China and provide theoretical basis for current prevention and control. An SEIQR epidemiological model incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation was constructed to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 inside and outside of Hubei province. With COVID-19 cases confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC), the optimal parameters of the model were set by calculating the minimum Chi-square value., RESULTS: Before the migration to and from Wuhan was cut off, the basic reproduction number in China was 5.6015. From 23 January to 26 January 2020, the basic reproduction number in China was 6.6037. From 27 January to 11 February 2020, the basic reproduction number outside Hubei province dropped below 1, but that in Hubei province remained 3.7732. Because of stricter controlling measures, especially after the initiation of the large-scale case-screening, the epidemic rampancy in Hubei has also been contained. The average basic reproduction number in Hubei province was 3.4094 as of 25 February 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April 2020., CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown of Hubei province significantly reduced the basic reproduction number. The large-scale case-screening also showed the effectiveness in the epidemic control. This study provided experiences that could be replicated in other countries suffering from the epidemic. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May.	false
0	Intermittent fasting, a possible priming tool for host defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection: crosstalk among calorie restriction, autophagy and immune response. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen of deadly Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which emerged as a major threat to public health across the world. Although there is no clear gender or socioeconomic discrimination in the incidence of COVID-19, individuals who are older adults and/or with comorbidities and compromised immunity have a relatively higher risk of contracting this disease. Since no specific drug has yet been discovered, strengthening immunity along with maintaining a healthy living is the best way to survive this disease. As a healthy practice, calorie restriction in the form of intermittent fasting (IF) in several clinical settings has been reported to promote several health benefits, including priming of the immune response. This dietary restriction also activates autophagy, a cell surveillance system that boosts up immunity. With these prevailing significance in priming host defense, IF could be a potential strategy amid this outbreak to fighting off SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, no review so far available proposing IF as an encouraging strategy in the prevention of COVID-19. A comprehensive review has therefore been planned to highlight the beneficial role of fasting in immunity and autophagy, that underlie the possible defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 pathogenesis and its impact on host immune response have also been briefly outlined. This review aimed at revisiting the immunomodulatory potential of IF that may constitute a promising preventive approach against COVID-19. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Severe infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus: Experience of a tertiary hospital with COVID-19 patients during the 2020 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and respiratory characteristics of a cohort of 43 patients with COVID-19 after an evolutive period of 28 days., DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out., SETTING: Intensive care., PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure., INTERVENTIONS: None., VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO. The lack of improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days could be a prognostic marker. . Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.	false
0	A glycan cluster on the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain is recognized by Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive antibodies. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has escalated into a global crisis. The spike (S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). A 3.1 A resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycan-dependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain involving multiple protomers. These data reveal a new epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike that can be targeted for vaccine design., Highlights: Fab-dimerized, glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1 bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 spike.3.1 A resolution cryo-EM structure reveals quaternary S2 epitope for HIV-1 bnAb 2G12.2G12 targets glycans, at positions 709, 717 and 801, in the SARS-CoV-2 spike.Our studies suggest a common epitope for FDG antibodies centered around glycan 709.	false
0	Clinical evaluation of the BioFire R Respiratory Panel 2.1 and detection of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the performance of the BioFire R Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) in the detection of SARS CoV-2 in comparison against three other SARS CoV-2 EUA assays. In these studies, the RP2.1 panel had 98 % positive percent agreement (48/49) and 100 % negative percent agreement (49/49). Since 30 % of nasopharyngeal swab specimens have a SARS CoV-2 Ct >30 and thus detection of virus in low titers is clinically relevant, a sample with a high titer was diluted and each 10 fold dilution was tested in triplicate and compared against 6 other EUA approved SARS CoV-2 assays. These data suggested that the BioFire R RP2.1 panel, along with four other SARS CoV-2 assays (Roche cobas, Cepheid Xpert Xpress, BioFire R Defense COVID19, and NECoV19), consistently detected viral RNA at the 10-7 dilution. Overall, these studies suggest that the BioFire R RP2.1 assay can be used to detect acute cases of SARS CoV2 in addition to patients with low viral titer later in disease presentation.

0	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated coagulopathy and its impact on outcomes in Shenzhen, China: A retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Early detection of suspected critical patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very important for the treatment of patients. This study aimed to investigate the role of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) to preview and triage., METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort study was designed from government designated COVID-19 treatment center. CAC was defined as International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score >=2. Data from 117 patients COVID-19 were reviewed on admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, vital organ dysfunction, discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission and hospital mortality. Among them, admission to ICU was increased progressively from 16.1% in patients with non-CAC to 42.6% in patients with CAC (P < 0.01). Likely, invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation were increased from 1.8%, 21.4% in patients with non-CAC to 21.3%, 52.5% in patients with CAC, respectively (P < 0.01). The incidences of acute hepatic injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in non-CAC and CAC were 28.6% vs. 62.3%, 8.9% vs. 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission were more in non-CAC than those of CAC (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression results showed that ISTH score >=2 was obviously associated with the admission to ICU (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.47-11.25 P = 0.007) and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.01-15.28 P = 0.001) in patients with COVID-19., CONCLUSION: All results show ISTH score >=2 is an important indicator to preview and triage for COVID-19 patients.

0	Immune thrombocytopenia in a patient with COVID-19. This case report describes immune thrombocytopenic purpura in a 41-year-old man hospitalized in the intensive-care unit for COVID-19, 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms with respiratory failure at admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was treated with, among other drugs, low-molecular-weight heparin. On day 8, his platelet count began descending rapidly. On day 10, heparin treatment was replaced by danaparoid sodium, but by day 13, the continued low platelet count made a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia unlikely. Normocytic nonregenerative anemia gradually developed. On day 13, a bone marrow aspiration showed numerous megakaryocytes and a few signs of hemophagocytosis. Corticosteroids were introduced on day 14, and platelets began rising after 3 days and then fell again on day 19. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) was then administered. Two days later, the platelet count returned to normal. The immune cause was confirmed by ruling out the differential diagnoses and the excellent and rapid response to intravenous immunoglobulins. Finally, the patient's respiratory state improved. He was discharged to a respiratory rehabilitation unit on day 38. Our case suggests that an immunological cause should be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia during COVID-19.	false
0	Negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing following COVID-19 infection in Two MS patients treated with ocrelizumab. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether MS disease modifying therapies impact ability to mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Case series and literature review. We report a series of two MS patients who developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy and subsequently exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 serology., RESULTS: A 42-year-old man and 39-year-old woman with MS developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy. Neither patient required hospitalization. The man exhibited negative serology at 7- and 9-weeks post-infection. The woman exhibited negative serology at 6- and 12-weeks post-infection., CONCLUSIONS: Large studies are essential to determine whether certain DMTs may blunt SARS-CoV-2 antibody production.

0	Rapidly fatal outcome of Covid-19 after successful emergency surgery during pandemic outbreak in Northern Italy. INTRODUCTION: A pandemic outbreak of novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 and responsible of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread from China to Europe, being Northern Italy the first focus outside Asia. Little is known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing surgery., PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we report the first confirmed case of early postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient recovering after Hartmann's procedure for acute diverticulitis. After an otherwise unevenful postoperative course, on post-operative day 8, the patient suddenly presented hyperpyrexia and cough, rapidly evolving to respiratory failure and death 36 h after symptoms onset. CT-scan identified bilateral, diffuse, interstitial pneumonitis and oropharyngeal swab test confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A previous contact with the partner, developing the same symptoms, remained unrecognized until ICU admission., DISCUSSION: During a pandemic outbreak, the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an inside patient initially considered to be infection-free has a pivotal importance not only for the prompt patient's management, but also to avoid infection spreading to other patients and hospital personnel. In the reported case, a more precise information to the patient regarding the imperative necessity to inform the medical personnel of any person of his entourage presenting, at any time, any tell-tale sign, symptom or examination which may be attributed to COVID-19, may have had allowed to anticipate patient's isolation and examinations and procedures aimed at identifying such an infection., CONCLUSION: Persistent hyperleucocytosis and increased CRP serum level in spite of uneventful postoperative course were the only, aspecific markers of an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection before symptoms' onset, and should be considered in future clinical practice in order to adopt the prompt and appropriate patient management and limit COVID-19 contagion in surgical units.

0	SARS-CoV-2 surveillance for a non-human primate breeding research facility. BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic prompted the need for a surveillance program to determine the viral status of the California National Primate Research Center non-human primate breeding colony, both for reasons of maintaining colony health and minimizing the risk of interference in COVID-19 and other research studies., METHODS: We collected biological samples from 10% of the rhesus macaque population for systematic testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR and host antibody response by ELISA. Testing required the development and validation of new assays and an algorithm using in laboratory-developed and commercially available reagents and protocols., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibody was detected in this study; therefore, we have proposed a modified testing algorithm for sentinel surveillance to monitor for any future transmissions. As additional reagents and controls become available, assay development and validation will continue, leading to the enhanced sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency of testing.

0	"The role of surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic: impact on training and lessons learned from a surgical resident's perspective. BACKGROUND: Surgeons are trained as ""internists that also operate,"" bringing an important skillset to patient management during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A review was performed to illustrate the response of surgical staff during the pandemic with regard to patient care and residency training., METHODS: The evaluation and assessment of the changes enacted at Stony Brook Medicine's Department of Surgery is illustrated through the unique perspective of surgical residents. No IRB approval or written consent was obtained nor it was necessary for the purposes of this paper., RESULTS: Hospital policy was enacted to hinder transmission of COVID-19 and included limited gatherings of people, restricted travel, quarantined symptomatic staff, and careful surveillance for disease incidence. Surgical residency transformed as residents were diverted from traditional surgical services to staff new COVID-19 ICUs. Education transitioned to an online-based platform for lectures and reviews. New skills sets were acquired such as PICC line placement and complex ventilator management., CONCLUSIONS: The viral surge impacted surgical training while also providing unique lessons regarding preparedness and strategic planning for future pandemic and disaster management."	false
0	Comparison of the diagnostic sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and glycoprotein-based antibody tests. The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has been followed by the rapid development of antibody tests. To assess the utility of the tests for clinical use and seroepidemiologic studies, we examined the sensitivity of commercial antibody tests from Roche, Abbott, Novatec, Virotech Siemens, Euroimmun, and Mediagnost in a prospective diagnostic study. The tests were evaluated with 73 sera from SARS CoV-2 RNA positive individuals with mild to moderate disease or asymptomatic infection. Sera were obtained at 2-3 weeks (N=25) or > 4 weeks (N=48) after symptom onset and viral RNA test. The overall sensitivity of the tests ranged from 64.4-93.2%. The most sensitive assays recognized 95.8-100 % of the sera obtained after 4 weeks or later. Sera drawn at 2-3 weeks were recognized with lower sensitivity indicating that the optimal time point for serologic testing is later than 3 weeks after onset of the disease. Nucleoprotein- and glycoproteinbased assays had similar sensitivity indicating that tests with both antigens are suitable for serological diagnostics. Breakdown of the test results showed that nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests of comparable sensitivity reacted with different sets of sera. The observation indicates that a combination of nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests would increase the percentage of positive results. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 - Preliminary Report. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein., METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 mug, 100 mug, or 250 mug. There were 15 participants in each dose group., RESULTS: After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-mug group, 109,209 in the 100-mug group, and 213,526 in the 250-mug group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-mug dose group reported one or more severe adverse events., CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04283461).

0	Serological chemiluminescence immunoassay for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: Dynamic monitoring of the concentration variation of IgM and IgG in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and exploring their diagnostic value for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)., METHODS: A total of 15 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as the COVID-19 group, and 50 patients were enrolled as the control group. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) were detected by a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)., RESULTS: According to the cutoff value recommended by the manufacturer (cutoff = 10 AU/mL), the sensitivity, specificity, Youden index (YI), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IgM were 60%, 100%, 60%, 100%, and 89.29%, respectively; and 86.67%, 100%, 86.67%, 100%, and 96.15%, respectively, for IgG. We reassessed the cutoff value of IgM. When the cutoff value for SARS-CoV-2 IgM was 1.83 AU/mL, the sensitivity, specificity, YI, PPV, and NPV were 93.33%, 98%, 91.33%, 93.33%, and 98%, respectively. During dynamic monitoring of the concentrations of IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients, we found the shortest times before a patient became IgM and IgG seropositive after symptom onset were 1.5 and 2 days, respectively. The longest times were 7 and 8 days, respectively. The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG both reached 100% in 8-14 days after symptom onset., CONCLUSION: The IgM cutoff value of 1.83 AU/mL for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was much better than the cutoff suggested by the manufacturer. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be ruled out if antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are still undetectable 14 days after symptom onset. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Impact on hospital admission of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in an Italian Hospital. : The worldwide pandemic caused by the novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in a new and lethal disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence of COVID-19 has posed a great threat to people's health worldwide and many people who need cardiovascular care were afraid of hospital admission, also in geographic areas with a few number of cases. This document shows how the pandemic is impacting hospital admission and the care of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients. We analyzed the number of interventional cardiology procedures to treat ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in our catheterization laboratory, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a specific period.	false
0	Dysregulation of the immune system as a driver of the critical course of the novel coronavirus disease 2019. Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory-related disease induced by the newly emerged virus SARS-CoV-2. Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immune factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses (CoVs) have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making them invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibition of the anti-viral response of type I interferons (IFNs), which supports uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There is growing body of evidence that the fatal hyperinflammation ('cytokine storm') responsible for the severe course of COVID-19 is a consequence of massive SARS-CoV-2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, a dampened innate anti-viral immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminating systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 clearly strengthens the evidence for a key role of sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (e.g. in children, a population with highly effective innate immune responses). Although administration of immunomodulatory therapeutics is recommended under certain conditions in the guidelines of COVID-19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 still exist. Extended knowledge of clinicians on the dysregulated immune response, which is a driver of the COVID-19 outcome, may improve both therapeutic protocols and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.	false
0	Recovery of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with tocilizumab: successful outcome in two critically ill patients. Background: Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 is a challenge for nowadays medical practice. Although there is no clarity in the principal mechanism of lung damage and ARDS development, it has been suggested that one of the main reasons of this pathology is the hyperactivation of the immune system, better known as cytokine storm syndrome. Tocilizumab has been proposed to treat COVID-19 severe cases associated to ARDS. Results & methodology: Here we present two successful cases of tocilizumab administration in two COVID-19 patients with prior administration of antiviral therapy (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir) with adequate response and resolution of ARDS, septic shock and severe pneumonia within the first 72 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case supports the usage of tocilizumab as an effective therapy in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome. Further studies should be done in order to assess its effectiveness and security.	false
0	Quantifying the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 long-term shedding among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. With anecdotal reports of viral shedding from COVID-19 patients for several weeks, there is a need to quantify the prevalence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Here, we characterize the temporal distribution of diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 PCR outcomes from nasopharyngeal swabs and associated EHR-derived features over two months for 874 COVID-19 patients with longitudinal data. Among a cohort of 379 COVID-19 patients with at least one positive follow-up SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, 53 patients remain SARS-CoV-2-positive after four weeks of initial diagnosis. Surprisingly, a majority of COVID-19 patients with long-term viral shedding are not hospitalized (40 of 53 patients), and have no enrichments among symptoms, demographics, or medical history. In a cohort of 370 COVID-19 patients that transition to a confirmed negative status, the upper bound of viral shedding duration has a mean of 21.2 days with standard deviation of 9.3 days. Of the 81 PCR-confirmed COVIDpos patients who have undergone serologic testing, 68 patients have developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG to date, with a mean upper bound of time to seroconversion of 38.1 days (95% C.I. = 35.2-41.1 days). Given that SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing may detect replication incompetent virus and that serologic tests do not imply neutralizing immunity, we suggest that the development of novel assays for measuring infectious viral load in non-hospitalized long-term shedders may help mitigate community transmission. This study motivates a platform that can link longitudinal diagnostic and serologic testing with real-time epidemiological data, towards proactively identifying and managing emerging hotspots of COVID-19.	false
0	Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction ameliorates inflammation in severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 patients with Yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome by eliminating IL-6 and TNF-a. The present study investigates the differences in inflammatory agents alterations, immune function, and leukocyte differential count evaluation in severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 patients with Yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome after the recommended Chinese medicine prescription of Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction. A total of 40 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome, diagnosed as severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 following the latest Chinese national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 (the 5th edition), were recruited. They were randomly divided into the pure western medicine therapy group (PWM) and integrated into Chinese and Western medicine therapy group (ICW). The general strategies were given to both groups according to the national recommendations, and the ICW group was given Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction extraorally. A radioimmunoassay method was adopted to detect the content of IL-6, IL-8,IL-2R,TNF-alpha, procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in sera. Flow cytometry was used to determine the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (the levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and the ratios of CD4+/CD8+). The white blood cell counts (WBC#), neutrophils count(N#), and lymphocyte counts (L#) were measured using a fully automatic blood rheological instrument. The t-test or Rank Sum Test and Spearman analysis were conducted to evaluate the differences. The results showed that IL-6 (P = 0.013) and TNF-alpha (P = 0.035) levels in the PWM group were significantly higher than those in the ICW group after treatment. Infection related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-CRP showed no differences. The analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in the values of CD4 and CD8 between the two groups. By the end of Day 29, all patients were discharged and the final cure rate for both group were 100 %. Taken together, we conclude that Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction could relieve inflammation of SARS-COV-2 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome by eliminating inflammatory agents. CM can serve as a complementary medication to western medicine, which should be highlighted in clinical settings.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Radiological Findings in Patients with COVID-19. After its origin in Wuhan, China, coronavirus related respiratory illness spread across the globe, being declared as a pandemic by WHO on March 13, 2020. Because it is acquired via respiratory droplets, community spread is responsible for the recent global crisis. The current diagnostic options include real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a few serology tests, including but not limited to the recently approved five minutes serology tests. The disease presents as a lower respiratory tract illness. Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease. CT scan is more sensitive than a chest X-ray in highlighting these changes. Copyright © 2020, Fatima et al.	false
0	Infection Density and Epidemic Size of COVID-19 in China outside the Hubei province. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to almost all countries in the world, claiming more than 160,000 lives and sickening more than 2,400,000 people by April 21, 2020. There has been research showing that on average, each infected person spreads the infection to more than two persons. Therefore the majority of the population is at risk of infection if no intervention measures were undertaken. The true size of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unknown, as a significant proportion of infected individuals only exhibit mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. A timely assessment of the evolving epidemic size is crucial for resource allocation and triage decisions. In this article, we modify the back-calculation algorithm to obtain a lower bound estimate of the number of COVID-19 infected persons in China outside the Hubei province. We estimate the infection density among infected and show that the drastic control measures enforced throughout China following the lockdown of Wuhan City effectively slowed down the spread of the disease in two weeks. Our findings from China are expected to provide guidelines and enlightenment for surveillance and control activities of COVID-19 in other countries around the world.	false
0	Two Detailed Plaque Assay Protocols for the Quantification of Infectious SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causal agent of COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19), an atypical pneumonia-like syndrome that emerged in December 2019. While SARS-CoV-2 titers can be measured by detection of viral nucleic acid, this method is unable to quantitate infectious virions. Measurement of infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50), which detects the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. However, this method only provides a qualitative infectious virus titer. Plaque assays are a quantitative method of measuring infectious SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the plaques formed in cell culture upon infection with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. As such, plaque assays remain the gold standard in quantifying concentrations of replication-competent lytic virions. Here, we describe two detailed plaque assay protocols to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 using different overlay and staining methods. Both methods have several advantages and disadvantages, which can be considered when choosing the procedure best suited for each laboratory. These assays can be used for several research purposes, including titration of virus stocks produced from infected cell supernatant and, with further optimization, quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from infected animals. © 2019 The Authors. Basic Protocol: SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay using a solid double overlay method.

0	Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19: sex differences and recovery time in real-life. Purpose: COVID-19 displays a variety of clinical manifestations; in pauci-symptomatic patients olfactory (OD) and gustatory dysfunctions (GD) may represent the first or only symptom. This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published. Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19. Method(s): We followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards. Result(s): All 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males. Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up. The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females. The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively. The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P = 0.009). Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P = 0.04), while the opposite was observed in the 58 asymptomatic patients (60 vs 73 years, P = 0.0018). Conclusion(s): Recovery from OD or GD was rapid, occurring within 4 weeks in most patients. Chemosensory dysfunctions in women was less frequent, but longer lasting. The value of our study is its focus on a population of hospitalized patients significantly older than those previously described, and the additional data on gender differences.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Low-density lipoprotein is a potential predictor of poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global threat to public health. The lipid pathophysiology in COVID-19 is unknown. Method(s): In this retrospective longitudinal study, we monitored the serum lipids in 17 surviving and 4 non-surviving COVID-19 cases prior to their viral infections and duration the entire disease courses. Result(s): In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0-4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3-3.1), p < 0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3-3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7-4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9-1.2), p = 0.02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of lowered LDL levels associated with disease progression (odds ratio: 4.48, 95% IC: 1.55-12.92, p = 0.006) and in-hospital death (odds ratio: 21.72, 95% IC: 1.40-337.54, p = 0.028). Conclusion(s): LDL levels inversely correlated to disease severities, which could be a predictor for disease progress and poor prognosis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Is it Possible to Safely Maintain a Regular Vascular Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic?. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the protocol adopted during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain elective activity in a vascular surgery unit while minimising the risk of contamination to both patients and physicians, and the impact of this activity on the intensive care (IC) resources. Method(s): The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Result(s): One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. It was necessary to screen 14 (47%) vascular surgeons with NPS after contact with infected colleagues, but none for unprotected contact with patients; all were found to be negative on NPS and serological evaluation. Conclusion(s): A dedicated protocol allowed maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no contamination of patients or physicians and minimal need for IC resources.Copyright © 2020 European Society for Vascular Surgery	false
0	Review of Chest Radiograph Findings of COVID-19 Pneumonia and Suggested Reporting Language. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The utility of chest radiography (CXR) remains an evolving topic of discussion. Current reports of CXR findings related to COVID-19 contain varied terminology as well as various assessments of its sensitivity and specificity. This can lead to a misunderstanding of CXR reports and makes comparison between examinations and research studies challenging. With this need for consistency, we propose language for standardized CXR reporting and severity assessment of persons under investigation for having COVID-19, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and patients who may have radiographic findings typical or suggestive of COVID-19 when the diagnosis is not suspected clinically. We recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection when typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR are present as an incidental finding. In addition, we summarize the currently available literature related to the use of CXR for COVID-19 and discuss the evolving techniques of obtaining CXR in COVID-19-positive patients. The recently published expert consensus statement on reporting chest computed tomography findings related to COVID-19, endorsed by the Radiological Society of North American (RSNA), the Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR), and American College of Radiology (ACR), serves as the framework for our proposal.	false
0	Prevalence of acute liver injury and hypertransaminemia in patients with COVID-19: a protocol for a systematic review. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has spread rapidly in China and around the world. Published studies have revealed that some patients with COVID-19 had abnormal liver function in laboratory tests. However, the results were inconsistent and the analysis of epidemiological data stratified by the severity of COVID-19 was not available in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, these meta-analyses were suspected of overestimating the incidence of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 because some studies considered transaminase elevation as liver injury, which might partially result from cardiac and muscle injury. This systematic review aims to enrol published literatures related to COVID-19 without language restriction, analyse the data based on the severity of the COVID-19 and explore the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the incidence of liver injury., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have conducted a preliminary search on PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database on 13 April 2020, for the studies published after December 2019 on the prevalence of acute liver injury and hypertransaminemia in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. We will estimate the pooled incidence of hypertransaminemia and acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 by using the random-effects model. The I2 test will be used to identify the extent of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plot and performing the Begg's and Egger's test if adequate studies are available. We will perform a risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since this study will be based on the published data, it does not require ethical approval. The final results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020179462. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	"Molecular mechanisms and epidemiology of COVID-19 from an allergist's perspective. The global pandemic caused by the newly described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused worldwide suffering and death of unimaginable magnitude from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being ""immune"" to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them.

0	Clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant patient after caesarean delivery. The clinical implications of COVID-19 in pregnancy remain unknown. While preliminary reports demonstrate that pregnant patients have a similar symptomatic presentation to the general population, the appropriate management and timing of delivery in these patients is still unclear, as pregnancy may impose additional risk factors and impede recovery in gravid patients. In this brief report, we present a case of COVID-19 in a pregnant patient with severe respiratory compromise, whose clinical status significantly improved after caesarean delivery. We also address the potential benefits of experimental therapy, including tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 receptors. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

0	Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection-Induced Chilblains: A Brisk Perieccrine Inflammatory Response. The varying cutaneous and pathological manifestations of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) may have prognostic implications. Acral ischemic findings present with a hypercoagulable state in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test). We continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and quarantining to prevent spread to the older and immunocompromised patients.	false
0	Epidemiological characteristics of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19): Features of risk factors and clinical features of the child population. The article presents features of epidemiology and clinical picture of a new virus-COVID-2019 in Kazakhstan, features of dynamics among the child population. As of April 15, 2020, there are 1,295 cases of COVID-19. In total, the infection was confirmed in 80 children. Among them, one newborn, two children under one year old and this has allowed to limit the spread of this serious disease with the cooperation of all citizens in terms of containment and individual protection measures. Objective(s): to evaluate the prevalence, clinical and epidemiological features and risk factors of COVID-19 in children of different ages. The design of the study corresponded to the observational analytical one. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread very quickly, so it is children of all ages who should be the focus of special attention, as they play a huge role in the spread of the disease.Copyright © 2020, by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum Ltd., UK.	false
0	Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review. Background and aims: COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Method(s): This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Result(s): This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	[Rapid review of the use of community-wide surgical masks and acute respiratory infections]. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of using surgical masks in community settings to reduce the probability of infection by SARS-CoV-2 or other acute viral respiratory infection, compared to not using surgical masks., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed the Cochrane rapid review methodology. The search strategy encompasses one academic database and pre-prints until April 1, 2020. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by one investigator. The full text review was divided among three researchers. The results were synthesized in a narrative way., RESULTS: 713 manuscripts were identified, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. Of six systematic reviews, four found no reduction in the probability of transmission. Experimental home studies found no differences in the probability of contagion associated with the use of mouth masks. Only one modeling study estimated a 20% reduction in the incidence of acute respiratory disease, assuming that 10 to 50% of the population use the surgical masks correctly., CONCLUSIONS: The scientific evidence is inconclusive to recommend or discourage the use of surgical masks at the population level. Considering the potential negative effects, official recommendations should await for the results of natural experiments currently occurring in countries that have recommended the use of face masks at the population level.	false
0	"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: 'Warp Speed' needs mind melds not warped minds. In this review, we address issues that relate to the rapid ""Warp Speed"" development of vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the antibody response that is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans, and how it may inform vaccine research. The isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and humans, and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus-challenge experiments in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses are recombinant proteins, which are not included in the initial wave of ""Warp Speed"" immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines. We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the ""Warp Speed"" vaccine program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse influence on vaccine uptake generally.

0	Meta-analysis of diagnostic performance of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies up to 25 April 2020 and public health implications. We reviewed the diagnostic accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% for IgM, and 85% for IgG and total antibodies. For specificity, the pooled estimate were 98% for IgM and 99% for IgG and total antibodies. In populations with<=5% of seroconverted individuals, unless the assays have perfect (i.e. 100%) specificity, the positive predictive value would be<=88%.

Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that ""The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease"" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."	false
0	Dynamic linkage of COVID-19 test results between Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System and UK Biobank. UK Biobank (UKB) is an international health resource enabling research into the genetic and lifestyle determinants of common diseases of middle and older age. It comprises 500 000 participants. Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System is a centralized microbiology database covering English clinical diagnostics laboratories that provides national surveillance of legally notifiable infections, bacterial isolations and antimicrobial resistance. We previously developed secure, pseudonymized, individual-level linkage of these systems. In this study, we implemented rapid dynamic linkage, which allows us to provide a regular feed of new COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) test results to UKB to facilitate rapid and urgent research into the epidemiological and human genetic risk factors for severe infection in the cohort. Here, we have characterized the first 1352 cases of COVID-19 in UKB participants, of whom 895 met our working definition of severe COVID-19 as inpatients hospitalized on or after 16 March 2020. We found that the incidence of severe COVID-19 among UKB cases was 27.4 % lower than the general population in England, although this difference varied significantly by age and sex. The total number of UKB cases could be estimated as 0.6 % of the publicly announced number of cases in England. We considered how increasing case numbers will affect the power of genome-wide association studies. This new dynamic linkage system has further potential to facilitate the investigation of other infections and the prospective collection of microbiological cultures to create a microbiological biobank (bugbank) for studying the interaction of environment, human and microbial genetics on infection in the UKB cohort.	false
0	Severe Acute Lung Injury Related to COVID-19 Infection: A Review and the Possible Role for Escin. Acute lung injury (ALI) represents the most severe form of the viral infection sustained by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment. In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury. In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange. Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab). In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology	false

0	Study of the application of gold nanoparticles for early detection of prostate cancer. Studies on the blood of patients with prostate cancer using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and corona protein size changes have shown that this test is highly specific and sensitive, but this method has not been studied in Iran, and therefore this study intends to perform this procedure using gold nanoparticles in prostate cancer detection. Blood samples of 60 male subjects aged 40-90 years were collected from 20 healthy, 20 benign and 20 prostate cancer patients. Optical scattering changes were measured by the level of gold nanoparticles mixed with these sera, and the responses were compared with the PSA index (Prostate Specific Antigen) of the subjects. Results of D2/D1 ratio analysis were performed using SPSS statistical software R. No significant differences were found in the size of the corona protein structure between the three groups of males with cancer, males with benign tumor, and healthy males. No correlation was found between the light scattering concentration and PSA serum level Due to changes in ambient temperature, prolonged test duration or high IgG levels in apparently healthy individuals, this test is not feasible in Iran. Performing this test requires advanced equipment to maintain the same temperature that do not exist in Iran. DLS also has major limitations for prostate cancer detection, so it cannot be a simple and accurate method for the early detection of prostate cancer, and it is suggested that other methods be used to diagnose.	false
0	[Perinatal and neonatal management plan for prevention and control of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (1st Edition)]. Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been prevalent in China. Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to 2019-nCoV. The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management and treatment of potential victims. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.	false
0	Resumption of activity in gastroenterology departments. Recommendations by SEPD, AEEH, GETECCU and AEG. The set of measures proposed by SEPD, AEEH, GETECCU and AEG are aimed to help departments in their resumption of usual activity. We have prepared a number of practical recommendations regarding patient management and the stepwise resumption of healthcare activity. These recommendations are based on the sparse, changing evidence available, and will be updated in the future according to daily needs and the availability of expendable materials to suit them; in each department they will be implemented depending upon the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in each region, and the burden the pandemic has represented for each hospital. The general objectives of these recommendations include: * To protect our patients against the risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to provide them with high-quality care. * To protect all healthcare professionals against the risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2. * To resume normal functioning of our departments in a setting of ongoing risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Method(s): In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Finding(s): 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12.2 years (SD 4.1) to 68.0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27.9%; 95% CI 20.5-36.0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32.6%; 24.7-40.9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35.7%; 27.6-44.2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34.1%; 26.2-42.5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41.9%; 22.5-50.5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0.7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10.5%; 95% CI 7.5-14.1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12.1%; 8.6-16.3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12.3%; 7.7-17.7] of 171), irritability (28 [12.8%; 8.7-17.6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18.9%; 14.1-24.2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19.3%; 15.1-23.9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30.4%; 23.9-37.3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100.0%; 88.0-100.0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32.2% (95% CI 23.7-42.0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14.9% (12.1-18.2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14.8% (11.1-19.4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76.9%; 95% CI 68.1-84.6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35.3 months (SD 40.1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation(s): If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

0	COVID-19 presenting with immune thrombocytopenia: a case report and review of the literature. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may be associated with thrombocytopenia which might have different mechanisms in different patients and in different phases of the disease. Cytokine release, thrombotic consumption or autoimmune destruction are some leading etiologies of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19. This case report presents a 41-year-old male COVID-19 patient who had petechiae and purpura as the referral symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed isolated thrombocytopenia with no other additional pathologic findings. Most probable diagnosis was COVID-19 induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment generated a good response. There were four other recent publications with a total of eight cases in the literature. The presented case was discussed in comparison with those similar cases.

0	Systematic review of the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China: could nicotine be a therapeutic option?. The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.	false
0	Pulmonary embolism in acute medicine: a case-based review incorporating latest guidelines in the COVID-19 era. Pulmonary embolism remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK, particularly following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), where those infected have an increased prevalence of venous thromboembolic events. The pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is thought to relate to a thromboinflammatory state within the pulmonary vasculature, triggered by the infection, but other risk factors such as reduced mobility, prolonged immobilisation and dehydration are likely to contribute. Several societies have released comprehensive guidelines emphasising the importance of risk stratification in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. They advocate the use of clinically validated risk scores in conjunction with biochemical and imaging results. Patients with mild disease can now be managed in the outpatient setting and with newly developed therapies, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, becoming available in more centres, treatment options for those with more severe disease are also expanding. This article presents four theoretical but realistic cases, each diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, but differing in levels of severity. These demonstrate how the guidelines can be applied in a clinical setting, with particular focus on risk stratification and management.	false
0	Laboratory abnormalities in children with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A pooled analysis and review. Limited data exists to-date on the laboratory findings in children with COVID-19, warranting the conduction of this study, in which we pool the currently available literature data on the laboratory findings seen in children with mild and severe COVID-19. Following an extensive literature search, we identified 24 eligible studies, including a total of 624 pediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, which report data on 27 different biomarkers. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) for these laboratory abnormalities in mild COVID-19. As data was too limited for children with severe COVID-19 to allow pooling, results were presented descriptively in a summary of findings table. Our data show an inconsistent pattern of change in the leukocyte index of mild and severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Specifically, changes in leukocyte counts were only observed in 32% of the mild pediatric cases (PPE: 13% increase, 19% decrease). In mild disease, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was frequently elevated, with a PPE of 33%. In severe disease, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were frequently elevated. Based on data obtained from early COVID-19 studies, leukocyte indices in children appear inconsistent, differing from those reported in adults that highlight specific leukocyte trends. This brings into question the utility and reliability of such parameters in monitoring disease severity in the pediatric population. Instead, we suggest physicians to serially monitor CRP, PCT, and LDH to track the course of illness in hospitalized children. Finally, elevated CK-MB in mild pediatric COVID-19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury. This highlights the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation of markers such as cardiac troponin in future studies.Copyright © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists	false
0	COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing before endoscopy: an economic analysis. Background and Aims: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopy utilization, causing significant health and economic losses. We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature. Result(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected. Conclusion(s): PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy	false
0	Covid-19 and People with HIV Infection: Outcomes for Hospitalized Patients in New York City. BACKGROUND: There have been limited data regarding the clinical impact of COVID-19 disease on people with HIV (PWH). In this study we compared outcomes for PWH with COVID-19 disease to a matched comparison group., DESIGN: We identified 88 PWH hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital system in New York between March 12 and April 23, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory values, HIV infection status, COVID-19 treatment, and outcomes from this group and matched comparators (one PWH to up to five patients by age, sex, race/ethnicity and calendar week of infection). We compared baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes (death, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge) for these two groups, as well as cumulative incidence of death by HIV status., RESULTS: Patients did not differ significantly by HIV status by age, sex or race/ethnicity due to the matching algorithm. PWH hospitalized with COVID-19 had high proportions of HIV virologic control on antiretroviral therapy. PWH had greater proportions of smoking (p<0.001) and comorbid illness than demographically similar uninfected comparators. There was no difference in COVID-19 severity on admission by HIV status (p=0.15). Poor outcomes for hospitalized PWH were frequent but similar to proportions in comparators; 18% required mechanical ventilation and ultimately 21% died during follow-up (compared with 23% and 20% respectively). There was similar cumulative incidence of death over time by HIV status (p=0.94)., INTERPRETATION: We found no differences in adverse outcomes associated with HIV infection for hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to a demographically similar patient group.

0	The dynamics of humoral immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 17 April 2020, it has infected 2 114 269 people, resulting in 145 144 deaths. The timing, magnitude and longevity of humoral immunity is not yet understood for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, understanding this is urgently required to inform the likely future dynamics of the pandemic, to guide strategies to allow relaxation of social distancing measures and to understand how to deploy limiting vaccine doses when they become available to achieve maximum impact. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human coronavirus to be described. Four human coronaviruses circulate seasonally and cause common colds. Two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, have crossed from animal sources into humans but have not become endemic. Here we review what is known about the human humoral immune response to epidemic SARS CoV and MERS CoV and to the seasonal, endemic coronaviruses. Then we summarize recent, mostly non-peer reviewed, studies into SARS-CoV-2 serology and reinfection in humans and non-human primates and summarize current pressing research needs.	false
0	COVID-19: A case report from Bangladesh perspective. A 34-year-old man without any significant medical history or comorbidities, suddenly developed fever, and shortness of breath, thereby admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. He had neither a history of traveling to Coronavirus disease (COVID) prone areas nor a direct contact of COVID positive patients. His chest X-ray revealed ground-glass opacity in the right middle and lower zone of the lung. The first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on throat and nasal swabs for the COVID upon admission was negative. Based on the chest X-ray result, RT-PCR was done again resulted positive. The patient was primarily treated with chloroquine and azithromycin. On full recovery, he was discharged from the hospital on day 12, after two subsequent throat swab samples tested negative by PCR (24 hours apart). He was encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least the next 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA by swab remained negative and the blood sample shows the presence of antibody (both IgM and IgG) in his follow-up visit (after 7 days of hospital discharge).Copyright © 2020	false
0	Genetically engineering a susceptible mouse model for MERS-CoV-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since 2012, monthly cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to cause severe respiratory disease that is fatal in ~35% of diagnosed individuals. The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology. Here, we describe the generation of the 288-330+/+ MERS-CoV mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by modifying two amino acids on mDPP4 (A288 and T330), and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel MERS-CoV isolates that cause fatal respiratory disease. The 288-330+/+ mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug, antibody, and vaccine therapeutic countermeasures for MERS-CoV. The chapter starts with a historical perspective on the emergence of MERS-CoV and animal models evaluated for MERS-CoV pathogenesis, and then outlines the development of the 288-330+/+ mouse model, assays for assessing a MERS-CoV pulmonary infection in a mouse model, and describes some of the challenges associated with using genetically engineered mice.Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.	false
0	Gene of the month: the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus spike protein. The year 2020 has seen a major and sustained outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2) infection that causes fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia, a disease called COVID-19. At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections. The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry. The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell. The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain. The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor. Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases. Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis. The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be 'preactivated' and highly infectious after replication. The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests. This review briefly outlines the structure and function of the 2019 novel CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

INTRODUCTION: Data about optimal initial assessment in patients with suspicion for COVID19-infection or already confirmed infection are sparse. Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy., METHODS: We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany. It is intended for a non-disaster situation. This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS). Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values. The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients. We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model., RESULTS: During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as ""inpatients"" according to initial assessment. Among 84 patients who were initially classified as ""outpatients"", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days. Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19. One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea., CONCLUSIONS: This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept. Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York."	false
0	Rapid establishment of a COVID-19 biobank in NHRI by National Biobank Consortium of Taiwan. By the request of the Minister of Health and Welfare, NHRI Biobank was assigned to establish a COVID-19 biobank in early Feb, 2020 to collect COVID-19 patients' blood samples for Taiwan researchers and industries in an emergent way. It was set up in less than 3 weeks and quickly opened for application. This biobank can provide applicants with biosamples, such as serum, DNA and RNA, and also the clinical and genomic data, so as to accelerate the COVID-19 treatment and prevention research in Taiwan. This COID-19 biobank already received 7 applications. It has become a very important research resource for the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan, including disease mechanism, the variable human responses and epidemic preventions.Copyright © 2020 Chang Gung University	false
0	Modeling the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 and restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China: a machine learning and mathematical model-based analysis. Background: To contain the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, many unprecedented intervention measures are adopted by the government. However, these measures may interfere in the normal medical service. We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China., Methods: Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou., Results: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926-67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month., Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April. However, the huge unmet medical needs for other diseases could result in massive migration of patients and their families, bringing tremendous challenges for medical service in major metropolis and disease control for the potential asymptomatic virus carrier.

0	Diarrhea During COVID-19 Infection: Pathogenesis, Epidemiology, Prevention, and Management. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency. An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechanism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute	false

This paper forecasts the future spread of COVID-19 by exploiting the identified lead-lag effects between different countries. Specifically, we first determine the past relation among nations with the aid of dynamic time warping. This procedure allows an elastic adjustment of the time axis to find similar but phase-shifted sequences. Afterwards, the established framework utilizes information about the leading country to predict the Coronavirus spread of the following nation. The presented methodology is applied to confirmed Coronavirus cases from 1 January 2020 to 28 March 2020. Our results show that China leads all other countries in the range of 29 days for South Korea and 44 days for the United States. Finally, we predict a future collapse of the healthcare systems of the United Kingdom and Switzerland in case of our explosion scenario.	false
0	Dynamic evolution of COVID-19 on chest computed tomography: experience from Jiangsu Province of China. Objectives: To determine the patterns of chest computed tomography (CT) evolution according to disease severity in a large coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cohort in Jiangsu Province, China. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 10, 2020, to February 18, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province were included, retrospectively. Quantitative CT measurements of pulmonary opacities including volume, density, and location were extracted by deep learning algorithm. Dynamic evolution of these measurements was investigated from symptom onset (day 1) to beyond day 15. Comparison was made between severity groups. Result(s): A total of 484 patients (median age of 47 years, interquartile range 33-57) with 954 CT examinations were included, and each was assigned to one of the three groups: asymptomatic/mild (n = 63), moderate (n = 378), severe/critically ill (n = 43). Time series showed different evolution patterns of CT measurements in the groups. Following disease onset, posteroinferior subpleural area of the lung was the most common location for pulmonary opacities. Opacity volume continued to increase beyond 15 days in the severe/critically ill group, compared with peaking on days 13-15 in the moderate group. Asymptomatic/mild group had the lowest opacity volume which almost resolved after 15 days. The opacity density began to drop from day 10 to day 12 for moderately ill patients. Conclusion(s): Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity and their evolution on CT varied with disease severity in COVID-19. These findings are valuable in understanding the nature of the disease and monitoring the patient's condition during the course of illness. Key Points: * Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity on CT change over time in COVID-19. * The evolution of CT appearance follows specific pattern, varying with disease severity.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.	false

Coronary CT angiograms are commonly performed for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and coronary arterial anatomy. However, extracardiac findings are frequently detected on these examinations and often can explain patients' underlying symptoms, having a significant impact on patient management. Here in, we discuss three cases of incidentally detected novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP). This case series highlights the image findings in NCIP and emphasizes the importance of evaluating all organs in the field of view on coronary CT angiograms. In addition, with the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, this report stresses the need for including NCIP in the differential diagnosis of patients with typical image findings in at-risk populations, as early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate patient management and post-exposure recommendations.Copyright © 2020, American Society of Emergency Radiology.	false
0	Depression, anxiety, and stress and socio-demographic correlates among general Indian public during COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The severe outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of Indians. AIM: The objective of this article was to find the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and stress and their socio-demographic correlates among Indian population during the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an electronic questionnaire. A total of 354 participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Depression, anxiety and stress were measured using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), a 21-item self-reported questionnaire. RESULT(S): In total, 25%, 28% and 11.6% of the participants were moderate to extremely severely depressed, anxious and stressed, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated employment status (odds ratio (OR)=1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-3.418) and binge drinking (OR=2.03; 95% CI: 1.045-3.945) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; gender (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.317-3.589), employment status (OR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.002-3.141) and binge drinking (OR=2.62; 95% CI: 1.361-5.048) were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms; and binge drinking (OR=3.42; 95% CI: 1.544-7.583) was significantly associated with stress symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): Depression, anxiety and stress among Indian population during the lockdown were prevalent. Along with other measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, mental health of citizens needs the urgent attention of the Indian government and mental health experts. Further large-scale studies should be conducted on different professions and communities such as health care professionals and migrant workers and incorporate other mental health indicators.	false

Regular physical activity grants significant health effects and lowers the risk of premature death for all causes, in particular cardiovascular ones in asymptomatic subjects. Physical activity is useful in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and lung diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, cancer and depression. Recent studies correlate inactivity with chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity, at the origin of chronic non-communicable diseases. The evidence must be taken seriously into consideration in this particular CoViD-19 emergency period and long-term effects of prolonged limitation of sports activity must not be overlooked. Contagion in open places is very difficult and the absolute prohibition of sports activities in open places and the closure of parks are creating discomfort and confusion. Institutions and media are generating the wrong message that active people must be looked at with disapproval. Instead, this habit should be encouraged, in order to protect citizens' and community health, lightening the welfare load for society.	false
0	Hepatic manifestations and impact of COVID-19 on the cirrhotic patient. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). The current pandemic is growing worldwide and could affect 50-60% of the world population in the months to come. The most severe disease manifestations are atypical pneumonia and sepsis, but the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the liver, has recently been reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.Copyright © 2020 Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia	false
0	Management of COVID-19 Pandemic in Spanish Inflammatory Bowel Disease Units: Results From a National Survey. BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly evolved into a pandemic that has represented a challenge to health systems worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) units have been forced to change their practices to address the disease and to ensure the quality of care. METHOD(S): We conducted a national survey among IBD gastroenterologist members of the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Colitis regarding changes of practice, IBD treatments, and diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. RESULT(S): We received 54 answers from Spanish hospitals. One hundred percent of the IBD units rescheduled onsite visits to telematic consultation, and elective endoscopic and surgical procedures were delayed. Protective measures were also taken in the infusion units (100% of health centers) and hospital pharmacies, with 40.7% sending subcutaneous medications to patients. No switching between intravenous and subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were made. We also found that 96.1% of IBD units advised their patients to maintain treatment if they were asymptomatic for COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19 symptoms, 92.6% of IBD units referred them to primary care or the emergency department. In addition, 7.5% of IBD units made a COVID-19 diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and/or chest x-ray.Modifications in IBD treatment and treatment recommended for COVID-19 are also discussed. CONCLUSION(S): We report a representative national survey of changes made in the structure, diagnosis of COVID-19, and modifications in IBD treatments within IBD units.Copyright © 2020 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

0	Continuous physiological monitoring using wearable technology to inform individual management of infectious diseases, public health and outbreak responses. Optimal management of infectious diseases is guided by up-to-date information at the individual and public health levels. For infections of global importance, including emerging pandemics such as COVID-19 or prevalent endemic diseases such as dengue, identifying patients at risk of severe disease and clinical deterioration can be challenging, considering that the majority present with a mild illness. In our article, we describe the use of wearable technology for continuous physiological monitoring in healthcare settings. Deployment of wearables in hospital settings for the management of infectious diseases, or in the community to support syndromic surveillance during outbreaks, could provide significant, cost-effective advantages and improve healthcare delivery. We highlight a range of promising technologies employed by wearable devices and discuss the technical and ethical issues relating to implementation in the clinic, focusing on low- and middle- income countries. Finally, we propose a set of essential criteria for the rollout of wearable technology for clinical use.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Thoracic computerised tomography scans in one hundred eighteen orthopaedic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: identification of chest lesions; added values; help in managing patients; burden on the computerised tomography scan department. Purpose: Based on the recent literature, chest computed tomography (CT) examination could aid for management of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Result(s): Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. Conclusion(s): Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: what obstetricians need to know. Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ~5 days (range, 2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ~1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 19 in minority populations of Newark, New Jersey. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to report the clinical features and outcomes of Black/African American (AA) and Latino Hispanic patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized in an inter-city hospital in the state of New Jersey. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study of AA and Latino Hispanic patients with COVID-19 admitted to a 665-bed quaternary care, teaching hospital located in Newark, New Jersey. The study included patients who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020, and April 10, 2020. We reviewed demographics, socioeconomic variables and incidence of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Logistic regression was used to identify predictor of in-hospital death. RESULT(S): Out of 416 patients, 251 (60%) had completed hospitalization as of April 10, 2020. The incidence of In-hospital mortality was 38.6% (n=97). Most common symptoms at initial presentation were dyspnea 39% (n=162) followed by cough 38%(n=156) and fever 34% (n=143). Patients were in the highest quartile for population's density, number of housing units and disproportionately fell into the lowest median income quartile for the state of New Jersey. The incidence of septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) was 24% (n=59), 21% (n=52), 33% (n=82) respectively. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age, lower serum Hemoglobin <10mg/dl, elevated serum Ferritin and Creatinine phosphokinase levels >1200U/L and>1000U/L. CONCLUSION(S): Findings from an inter-city hospital's experience with COVID-19 among underserved minority populations showed that, more than one of every three patients were at risk for in-hospital death or morbidity. Older age and elevated inflammatory markers at presentation were associated with in-hospital death.	false
0	Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new beta-Coronavirus that was first detected in 2019 in Wuhan, China. In the ensuing months it has been transmitted worldwide. Here the authors present the current knowledge on the epidemiology of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 replicates mainly in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R) is currently between 2 and 3, while the incubation period is 6 (median, range 2-14) days. Although most infections are uncomplicated, 5-10% of cases develop pneumonia, which can lead to hospitalization, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for a complicated disease course include age, hypertension, chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. The overall case fatality rate is 1.4%, with the rate rising in the sixth decade of life. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions in social contact have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, leading to rapid reductions in R. Which of the measures have been effective is still unknown.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	false
0	Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review. Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Method(s): Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Result(s): We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion(s): French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.Copyright © 2020 L'Encephale, Paris	false
0	Rapid response to COVID-19: health informatics support for outbreak management in an academic health system. OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of technological support important for optimizing clinical management of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our health system has confirmed prior and current cases of COVID-19. An Incident Command Center was established early in the crisis and helped identify electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to support clinical care. RESULT(S): We outline the design and implementation of EHR-based rapid screening processes, laboratory testing, clinical decision support, reporting tools, and patient-facing technology related to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The EHR is a useful tool to enable rapid deployment of standardized processes. UC San Diego Health built multiple COVID-19-specific tools to support outbreak management, including scripted triaging, electronic check-in, standard ordering and documentation, secure messaging, real-time data analytics, and telemedicine capabilities. Challenges included the need to frequently adjust build to meet rapidly evolving requirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs of multiple stakeholders while maintaining high-quality, prepandemic medical care. CONCLUSION(S): The EHR is an essential tool in supporting the clinical needs of a health system managing the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Saliva as a Potential Diagnostic Specimen for COVID-19 Testing. The current outbreak of the highly contagious, animal origin SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19. The disease is globally pandemic and as per World Health Organization (WHO) has spread to 235 countries. There is global lockdown for containment of the virus transmission. Testing of symptomatic patients, healthcare workers and suspected individuals and mass screening is vital. WHO recommends nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab for the quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA level through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The virus is shown to be consistently present in saliva and rRTPCR of saliva specimens and have advantages over NP and OP swabs such as self-collection of saliva, avoidance of healthcare workers for specimen collection, cost-effectiveness, etc. This article explores the current literature and suggests saliva as an emerging potential diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 testing.	false
0	Why COVID-19 Silent Hypoxemia is Baffling to Physicians. Patients with COVID-19 are described as exhibiting oxygen levels incompatible with life without dyspnea. The pairing-dubbed happy hypoxia, but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia-is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include how dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, how prevailing carbon dioxide tensions (PaCO2) blunt the brain's response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for hypoxemic patients free of dyspnea are operating in the dark-placing vulnerable COVID-19 patients at considerable risk. In conclusion, features about COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in the light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.

0	"Response to ""Lupus anticoagulant is frequent in patients with Covid-19"". We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the letter from Dr. Ines Harzallah, et al. Antiphospholipid antibody assays including lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I have also been performed in dozens of our patients, however, very few of them got positive results, we don't think that antiphospholipid antibody exists universally in COVID-19 patients. In addition, two of the three reported cases with antiphospholipid antibodies mentioned in the letter [1] also seem to meet the International Society on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation [2], the causality between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis in these cases is still uncertain.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Rapid development of an inactivated vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis. There are currently no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of the virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains. Three immunizations using two different doses (3 mug or 6 mug per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These data support clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans. Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Corona virus: A novel outbreak. In December 2019, a new pneumonia case emerged in the Wuhan, Hubei province of China which had an association with the novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV). Most of the diagnosed cases had exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The present case is the successor of three earlier similar cases of Coronavirus known as SARS-Corona (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) Virus and MERS-Corona Virus (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome). The origin of the epidemic is still unknown and a lot of other uncertainties hinders the development of vaccines for the virus. As studies suggest that this virus is an evolution of SARS virus concerns are growing around the world as death toll has already surpassed that of SARS virus. This paper explores about the coronavirus, its relation to the similar SARS and MERS virus, its outreach and global impact according to the current scenario.Copyright Published by Oriental Scientific Publishing Company © 2020	false
0	Community Treatment Centers for Isolation of Asymptomatic and Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Coronavirus Disease, South Korea. As a part of measures to decrease spikes in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths outside of hospitals, the government of South Korea introduced a plan for community treatment centers (CTCs) to isolate and monitor patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. We assessed outcomes of 568 patients admitted to 3 CTCs near Daegu. More (64.6%) women than men (35.4%) were admitted, and the mean age of patients was 36.0 years (SD +15.0 years). Among all patients, 75.7% remained asymptomatic while at the CTCs. The mean time patients remained at CTCs was 19.6 days (SD +5.8 days) from the day of diagnosis until our study ended on March 23, 2020. Because they offer appropriate clinical triaging and daily monitoring for patients, CTCs are a safe alternative to medical institutions for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Corona virus (Covid-19) pandemic: A systematic review. The recently emerged CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) is now considered as a pandemic threat worldwide. It is novel class of virus that affects the respiratory tract and leads to difficulty in breathing. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans. It has been known to infect human hosts and cause respiratory diseases. Currently, there is still dearth of information on foremost source of viral transmission along with exact pathogenic mechanism of action. Besides this, the hospital outbreak of super-spreading virus has made a greater concern about global health due to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are highly pahogenic. There have been around 1,519,503 reported cases of coronavirus disease worldwide and 88,549 reported deaths along with 3,30,916 total recovered patients to date (9/4/2020).The disease is transmitted by inhalation of infected droplets .The symptoms are usually fever, sputum production, nasal congestion, pneumonia, sore throat,breathlessness. Diagnosis of disease is done by routine lab findings, specimen examination using RT-PCR and by using diagnostic kits. Prevention entails regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose and home isolation of suspected cases. Treatment is usually supportive of ayurvedic, herbal medicines and allopathic combinations mostly antiviral drugs. This revelation may exert crucial guidance for understanding the viral infection and measures to prevent and treat infection.Copyright © 2020 Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Cracking the code to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19): Lessons from the eye. With the recent March 11, 2020 declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) further attention has turned to understanding and managing the outbreak of infectious disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells through its ability to bind to a human ACE2 protein. Through our understanding of diabetic retinopathy, there are genetic-based variations in ACE2 levels that confer varying risk profiles for diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, emerging research suggests ACE2 levels confer varying risk profiles for COVID-19- Using data comparisons between geographic prevalence rates of diabetic retinopathy and existing COVID-19 mortality rates may enable improved predictions of the rates of spread of COVID-19 in various geographic regions. The goal of this report is to encourage cross-disciplinary horizontal vision in the field of medicine and science in order to further progress in managing and treating human disease.© Copyright Adams, 2020.	false
0	Strategies to control and prevent novel coronavirus 2019: A quick overview. The emergence of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Wuhan City of China and its rapid shedding among countries, which reminded the history of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) happened almost two decades ago. However, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV shared within few days of outbreak shows the better response of China and the world against the virus, perhaps due to the availability of advanced technology and lesson learned from previous epidemics. The researchers trying to determine the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission of 2019-nCoV. It is believed that disease reporting and data sharing about the emerged Coronavirus with international researchers are important steps to reduce the spread of the virus to the rest of the world. This report is aimed to understand the current status of the 2019-nCoV, problems related to it and possible measures for prevention. The infection may spread through wildlife and asymptomatic patients. People in underdeveloped countries having no basic facilities are at higher risk. Ban on wildlife trade and avoiding unnecessary traveling for a certain period is required to minimize the spread of the disease. The use of face masks, keeping away from the public gathering are other possible means of precautions, capacity building of health workers and provided relevant facilities (equipment, kits, etc.) to underdeveloped countries will further help to contain the pandemic. In the current scenario, it is concluded that 2019-nCoV is spreading irrespective of the borders and become pandemic. Extensive research is a cry of the day to contain the virus and curtail human losses.Copyright © 2020, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences. All rights reserved.	false
0	Treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients with anti-interleukin drugs (COV-AID): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of individually or simultaneously blocking IL-6, IL-6 receptor and IL-1 versus standard of care on blood oxygenation and systemic cytokine release syndrome in patients with COVID-19 coronavirus infection and acute hypoxic respiratory failure and systemic cytokine release syndrome. Trial design: A phase 3 prospective, multi-center, interventional, open label, 6-arm 2x2 factorial design study. Participant(s): Subjects will be recruited at the specialized COVID-19 wards and/or ICUs at 16 Belgian participating hospitals. Only adult (>=18y old) patients will be recruited with recent (<=16 days) COVID-19 infection and acute hypoxia (defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350mmHg or PaO2/FiO2 below 280 on supplemental oxygen and immediately requiring high flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation) and signs of systemic cytokine release syndrome characterized by high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those, who have not been on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours before randomisation. Patients should have had a chest X-ray and/or CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days before randomisation. Patients with active bacterial or fungal infection will be excluded. Intervention and comparator: Patients will be randomized to 1 of 5 experimental arms versus usual care. The experimental arms consist of Anakinra alone (anti-IL-1 binding the IL-1 receptor), Siltuximab alone (anti-IL-6 chimeric antibody), a combination of Siltuximab and Anakinra, Tocilizumab alone (humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) or a combination of Anakinra with Tocilizumab in addition to standard care. Patients treated with Anakinra will receive a daily subcutaneous injection of 100mg for a maximum of 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Siltuximab (11mg/kg) or Tocilizumab (8mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800mg) are administered as a single intravenous injection immediately after randomization. Main outcomes: The primary end point is the time to clinical improvement defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a six-category ordinal scale measured daily till day 28 or discharge from the hospital or death. This ordinal scale is composed of (1) Death; (2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; (3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; (4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; (5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; (6) Not hospitalized. Randomisation: Patients will be randomized using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). A 2x2 factorial design was selected with a 2:1 randomization regarding the IL-1 blockade (Anakinra) and a 1:2 randomization regarding the IL-6 blockade (Siltuximab and Tocilizumab). Blinding (masking): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total of 342 participants will be enrolled: 76 patients will receive usual care, 76 patients will receive Siltuximab alone, 76 patients will receive Tocilizumab alone, 38 will receive Anakinra alone, 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Siltuximab and 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Tocilizumab. Trial Status: COV-AID protocol version 3.0 (15 Apr 2020). Participant recruitment is ongoing and started on April 4th 2020. Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, it is difficult to anticipate the rate of participant recruitment. Trial registration: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 1st, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04330638) and on EudraCT on April 3rd 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001500-41).

0	Two Randomized Controlled Trials of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Vaccination to reduce absenteeism among health care workers and hospital admission by elderly persons during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of the study protocols for two randomised. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of these two separate trials are: (1) to reduce health care workers (HCWs) absenteeism; and (2) to reduce hospital admission among the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic through BCG vaccination. TRIAL DESIGN: Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials PARTICIPANTS: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the COVID-19 infection and (2) elderly >=60 years. The HCW trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331, SSI, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended BCG vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES: (1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in HCWs for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented COVID-19. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo (1;1) centrally using a computer- based system, stratified by study centre. BLINDING (MASKING): Subjects, investigators, physicians and outcome assessors are blinded for the intervention. Only the pharmacist assistant that prepares- and research personnel that administers- study medicines are unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): (1) The sample size for the first trial is N=1500 HCWs randomised 1:1 to either BCG vaccine (n=750) and placebo (n=750) and (2) The sample size for the second trial is N=1600 elderly persons randomised to BCG vaccine (n=800) and the placebo group (n=800). TRIAL STATUS: HCW: version 4.0, 24-04-2020. Recruitment began 25-03-2020 and was completed on the 23-04-2020. Elderly: version 3.0, 04-04-2020. Recruitment began 16-04- 2020 and is ongoing.

0	Repair of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Stromal Cell Administration in COVID-19 (REALIST-COVID-19): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised, controlled trial. Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of a single intravenous infusion of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of MSCs on important clinical outcomes, as described below. Trial design: REALIST COVID 19 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple blinded trial. Participant(s): The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across the United Kingdom. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS as defined by the Berlin definition, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical diagnosis or PCR test will be eligible. Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: more than 72 hours from the onset of ARDS; age < 16 years; patient known to be pregnant; major trauma in previous 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer); WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; venous thromboembolism currently receiving anti-coagulation or within the past 3 months; patient receiving extracorporeal life support; severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh > 12); Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; prisoners; declined consent; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; previously enrolled in the REALIST trial. Intervention and comparator: Intervention: Allogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension of a fixed dose of 400 x106 cells in 40ml volume, to be diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for administration. Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls). The cellular product (REALIST ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics. Main outcomes: The primary safety outcome is the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary efficacy outcome is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and 14; respiratory compliance, driving pressure and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14; extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and 90-day mortality. Randomisation: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials, University of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio. Blinding (masking): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A sample size of 60 patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the control group. If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). Trial status: REALIST Phase 1 completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned to commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2 trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC. Submissions were made to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and MHRA to amend the protocol to a COVID-19 specific patient population and the protocol amendment was accepted by the REC on 27th March 2020 and MHRA on 30th March 2020 respectively. Other protocol changes in this amendment included an increase in the time of onset of ARDS from 48 to 72 hours, inclusion of clinical outcomes as secondary outcomes, the provision of an option for telephone consent, an indicative sample size and provision to continue recruitment beyond this indicative sample size. The current protocol in use is version 4.0 23.03.2020 (Additional file 1). Urgent Public Health status was awarded by the NIHR on 2 April 2020 and the trial opened to recruitment and recruited the first participant the same day.

0	Detection of SARS-COV-2 in Placental and Fetal Membrane Samples. Introduction: Since the first reports of the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease (COVID-19), concerns remain about whether the virus is transmissible in pregnant women from the mother to the fetus during either the antepartum period or the process of labor and delivery. One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.1 Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,2,3 findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero. We report our experience with placental/membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results after delivery to a series of symptomatic mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy., Methods: IRB approval was obtained. All pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who gave birth between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020 at NYU Langone Health were identified by a search of the electronic medical record. Charts were reviewed for documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing sent from either the placenta or membranes within 30 minutes following delivery. PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 was performed using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress assay. Placental swabs were obtained from the amniotic surface after clearing the surface of maternal blood (placental PCR). Membrane swabs were obtained from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes (membrane PCR). Maternal COVID-19 illness was categorized as mild, severe, or critical.4 The time interval from maternal diagnosis of COVID-19 to delivery was calculated in days. Infants were tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR between days of life 1 and 5 while hospitalized. Hospitalized infants were also assessed for clinical signs and symptoms, including fever, cough, and nasal congestion., Results: Of 32 COVID-19 positive pregnant patients who gave birth in this timeframe, placental or membrane swabs were sent from 11 patients (Table). Three of 11 swabs were positive. None of the infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on days of life 1 through 5, and none demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 infection., Discussion: Of 11 placental or membrane swabs sent following delivery, 3 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, all in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness at time of delivery. This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental or membrane samples. While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure. Given the mixing of maternal and fetal fluid and tissue at time of delivery, the origin of the detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our series is unclear. It may represent contamination from maternal blood, amniotic fluid, or COVID-19 infection of the membranes and amniotic sac. For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.5,6Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission. Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive. In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.

0	Evalua ting the efficacy and safety of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in severely ill adults with COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized adults with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Trial Design: This is a prospective, single-center, phase 2, randomized, controlled trial that is blinded to participants and clinical outcome assessor. Participant(s): Eligible participants include adults (>= 18 years) with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab within 14 days of randomization, evidence of infiltrates on chest radiography, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) <= 94% on room air, and/or need for supplemental oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation, who are willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to performing study procedures or who have a legally authorized representative available to do so. Exclusion criteria include participation in another clinical trial of anti-viral agent(s)*for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), receipt of any anti-viral agent(s)*with possible activity against SARS-CoV-2 <24 hours prior to plasma infusion, mechanical ventilation (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) for >= 5 days, severe multi-organ failure, history of allergic reactions to transfused blood products per NHSN/CDC criteria, known IgA deficiency, and pregnancy. Included participants will be hospitalized at the time of randomization and plasma infusion.*Use of remdesivir as treatment for COVID-19 is permitted. The study will be undertaken at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, USA. Intervention and comparator: The investigational treatment is anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma. To procure the investigational treatment, volunteers who recovered from COVID-19 will undergo testing to confirm the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to the spike trimer at a 1:400 dilution. Donors will also be screened for transfusion-transmitted infections (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, WNV, HTLV-I/II, T. cruzi, ZIKV). If donors have experienced COVID-19 symptoms within 28 days, they will be screened with a nasopharyngeal swab to confirm they are SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative. Plasma will be collected using standard apheresis technology by the New York Blood Center. Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive one unit (200 - 250 mL) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus one unit (200 - 250 mL) of the earliest available control plasma. The control plasma cannot be tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prior to the transfusion, but will be tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody after the transfusion to allow for a retrospective per-protocol analysis. Main outcomes: The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement. This is defined as time from randomization to either discharge from the hospital or improvement by one point on the following seven-point ordinal scale, whichever occurs first. 1. Not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities 2. Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen 4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen 5. Hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation 6. Hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both 7. Death This scale, designed to assess clinical status over time, was based on that recommended by the World Health Organization for use in determining efficacy end-points in clinical trials in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A recent clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of lopinavir- ritonavir for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 used a similar ordinal scale, as have recent clinical trials of novel therapeutics for severe influenza, including a post-hoc analysis of a trial evaluating immune plasma. The primary safety endpoints are cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events during the study period. Randomization: Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus control plasma using a web-based randomization platform. Treatment assignments will be generated using randomly permuted blocks of different sizes to minimize imbalance while also minimizing predictability. Blinding (masking): The study participants and the clinicians who will evaluate post-treatment outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The blood bank and the clinical research team will not be blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): We plan to enroll 129 participants, with 86 in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 arm, and 43 in the control arm. Among the participants, we expect ~70% or n = 72 will achieve clinical improvement. This will yield an 80% power for a one-sided Wald test at 0.15 level of significance under the proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio of 1.5.

0	Incidence of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Background: Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in December, Chinese government has implemented various measures including travel bans, centralized treatments, and home quarantines to slowing the transmission across the country. In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Method(s): We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. Result(s): A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.31-4.37). Conclusion(s): Home quarantine has been effective in preventing the early transmission of COVID-19, but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Disruption of the CCL5/RANTES-CCR5 Pathway Restores Immune Homeostasis and Reduces Plasma Viral Load in Critical COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is now pandemic with nearly three million cases reported to date. Although the majority of COVID-19 patients experience only mild or moderate symptoms, a subset will progress to severe disease with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response characterized by runaway inflammation, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as the major driver of pathology in severe COVID-19. With no treatments currently approved for COVID-19, therapeutics to prevent or treat the excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8+ T cell levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Following compassionate care treatment with the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Consistent with reduction of plasma IL-6, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed declines in transcriptomic myeloid cell clusters expressing IL-6 and interferon-related genes. These results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19.	false
0	Covid-19 and lung cancer: A greater fatality rate?. Background: Currently there are no reported series determining the Covid-19 infected lung cancer patient's characteristics and outcome that allow us to clarify strategies to protect our patients. In our study we determine whether exists differences in cumulative incidence and severity of Covid-19 infection between lung cancer patients visiting our Medical Oncology department and the reference population of our center (320,000 people), in the current epicenter of the pandemic in Europe (Madrid, Spain). We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Result(s): 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9 %) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3 %) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p < 0.0001). Dead lung cancer patients were elderly compared to survivors: 72 versus 64.5 years old (p = 0.12). Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improves the outcome of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients, detecting only 1/6 deaths between patients under this treatment versus others treatment, with statistical significance in the univariate and multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.04, p = 0.018). Conclusion(s): Lung cancer patients have a higher mortality rate than general population. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment seems like a good treatment option. It is important to try to minimize visits to hospitals (without removing their active treatments) in order to decrease nosocomial transmission.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Prompt predicting of early clinical deterioration of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients: usefulness of a combined score using IL-6 in a preliminary study. BACKGROUND: The early identification of patients at risk of clinical deterioration is of interest considering the timeline of COVID-19 after the onset of symptoms. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of testing serum IL-6 and other serological and clinical biomarkers, to predict a short-term negative clinical course of non critical COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): 208 patients with non critical COVID-19 pneumonia at admission were consecutively enrolled. Clinical and laboratory findings obtained upon admission were analyzed by using survival analysis and stepwise logistic regression for variable selection. Three-day worsening as outcome in a logistic model to generate a prognostic score was used. RESULT(S): Clinical worsening occurred in 63 patients (16=died; 39=transferred to Intensive Care Unit; 8 worsening of respiratory failure). Forty-five of them worsened within 3 days after admission. The risk of clinical worsening was progressively enhanced along with increasing quartiles of IL-6 levels. Multivariate analysis showed that IL-6 (p=0.005), CRP (p=0.003) and SaO2/FiO2 (p=0.014) and were the best predictors for clinical deterioration in the first 3 days after admission. The combined score yielded an AUC=0.88 (95% CI 0.83-0.93). A nomogram predicting the probability of 3-day worsening was generated. The score also showed good performance for 7-day and 14-day or 21-day worsening and in predicting death occurring during all the follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): Combining IL-6, CRP and SaO2/FiO2 in a score, may help clinicians to identify upon admission those patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for a further 3-day clinical deterioration.Copyright © 2020.

0	Coronavirus Outbreak: Is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months. Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department. A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19. Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection. The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training. Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission. The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.Copyright © 2020 American College of Radiology	false
0	Number of COVID-19 cases in Chile at 120 days with data at 21/03/2020 and threshold of daily effort to flatten the epi-curve. We present a straightforward projection with data up to 21/03/2020 of the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases per day in Chile using data from the Ministry of Health. Assuming an arithmetical growth in the second variation of the data, we present a cubic adjustment model in which we estimate over 100 000 cases at 120 days consistent with the data recorded to date. Furthermore, we use an exponential total case model to represent (using a parameter) the daily effort to reduce a high initial daily growth rate. We simulate this model with different numerical scenarios of feasibility and desired future prevalence.	false
0	Ophthalmic Manifestations Of Coronavirus (COVID-19). Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic caused by the highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] There have been several reports of eye redness and irritation in COVID-19 patients, both anecdotal and published, suggesting that conjunctivitis may be an ocular manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A study conducted during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak detected SARS-CoV in tear samples in SARS patients in Singapore.[2] Lack of eye protection was a primary risk factor of SARS-CoV transmission from SARS patients to healthcare workers in Toronto, prompting a concern that respiratory illness could be transmitted through ocular secretions.[3][[4] Similar concerns have been raised with SARS-CoV-2, especially among eye care providers and those on the front lines triaging what could be initial symptoms of COVID-19. As conjunctivitis is a common eye condition, ophthalmologists may be the first medical professionals to evaluate a patient with COVID-19. Indeed, one of the first providers to voice concerns regarding the spread of Coronavirus in Chinese patients was Li Wenliang, MD, an ophthalmologist. He later died from COVID-19 and was believed to have contracted the virus from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient in his clinic. The authors of this article have attempted to collect the most up-to-date information on ophthalmic manifestations of COVID-19 as a resource for identifying symptoms, providing diagnostic pearls, and mitigating transmission.

Objective: To explore the feasibility of direct renin inhibitor aliskiren for the treatment of severe patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Methods: A retrospective case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren. On the basis of comprehensive therapy combined with antiviral and oxygenation treatment, aliskiren antihypertensive treatment was taken for three to four weeks. The blood pressure control of four patients was satisfactory and there was no complaint of discomfort. The condition improved, and all patients had reached the discharge standard and were discharged. Conclusion:  Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension. Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients..	false

BACKGROUND: The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in CoViD-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) has so far been investigated in only a few studies. Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking., OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated., RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study., CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D-dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Further studies on point of care methods (TEG R, ROTEM R) for the detection of hypercoagulability in SARS-CoV2 are necessary.	false
0	Effectiveness of Cone Beam Computed Tomography Imaging During Radiation Therapy for the Detection of Initial Coronavirus Lung Disease 2019. In this unique historic period afflicted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, radiation therapy treatments cannot be delayed or suspended. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with recently diagnosed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with metastatic liver and bone lesions. A SARS-CoV-2 test was performed upon hospital admission and was negative. After 5 days she underwent radiation therapy on T6 and T11 with single fractions of 8 Gy each. Before treatment a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was performed to check the setup of the patient. Some suspected lung areas of ground glass opacities (GGOs) were clearly visible in the CBCT without any counterpart in the previous computed tomography (CT) simulation scan 3 days before. A new high-quality chest CT scan confirmed the previously suspected GGOs. The exam revealed multiple bilateral areas of subpleural GGOs, which are the primary findings on CT scan in the early phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung infection, in addition to pleural effusions, a finding that may occur as a complication of COVID-19. The patient then urgently repeated the SARS-CoV-2 test, which was positive and confirmed the infection. In conclusion, daily CBCT can be effective for early detection of COVID-19 lung disease in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Prolonged Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in Fomites. We spotted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on polystyrene plastic, aluminum, and glass for 96 hours with and without bovine serum albumin (3 g/L). We observed a steady infectivity (<1 log10 drop) on plastic, a 3.5 log10 decrease on glass, and a 6 log10 drop on aluminum. The presence of proteins noticeably prolonged infectivity.	false
0	Development of a lateral flow immunoassay strip for rapid detection of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus. The ongoing worldwide SARS-CoV-2 epidemic clearly has a tremendous influence on public health. Molecular detection based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, high false negative rates were reported. We describe here the development of a point-of-care (POC) serological assay for the detection of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 muL of the analyte solution containing 10 muL of serum and 70 muL sample diluent. The performance of the established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results indicated that the LFIAs for SARS-CoV-2 had satisfactory stability and reproducibility. As a result, our fast and easy LFIAs could provide a preliminary test result for physicians to make the correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections along with alternative testing methods and clinical findings, as well as seroprevalence determination, especially in low-resource countries.	false
0	"COVID-19 projections for reopening Connecticut. Closure of schools and the statewide ""Stay Safe, Stay Home"" order have effectively reduced COVID-19 transmission in Connecticut, with model projections estimating incidence at about 1,300 new infections per day. If close interpersonal contact increases quickly in Connecticut following reopening on May 20, the state is at risk of a substantial increase of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by late Summer 2020. Real-time metrics including case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths may fail to provide enough advance warning to avoid resurgence. Substantial uncertainty remains in our knowledge of cumulative COVID-19 incidence, the proportion of infected individuals who are asymptomatic, infectiousness of children, the effects of testing and contact tracing on isolation of infected individuals, and how contact patterns may change following reopening."	false
0	Determining the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare worker. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection from their interactions with patients and in the community. Limited availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular N95 respirators, has fueled concerns about whether HCWs are adequately protected from exposure while caring for patients. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a HCW - the community or the healthcare system - is critical for understanding the effectiveness of hospital infection control and PPE practices. In Dane County, Wisconsin, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low (cumulative prevalence of ~0.06% - positive cases / total population in Dane county as of April 17). Although SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs are often presumed to be acquired during the course of patient care, there are few reports unambiguously identifying the source of acquisition. The objective of this brief report was to determine the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare worker.	false
0	Quantifying the Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Patients: A Technical Report of Patient Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic at a High-volume Radiation Oncology Proton Center in New York City. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world and now affects more people within the United States than any other country. New York City has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. Both locally and across the country, there is great concern in our ability to deliver appropriate medical care during this time. Radiation therapy is another essential clinical service that cannot afford to suffer prolonged delays without compromising patient outcomes. Early action and guidance are therefore critical to minimize transmission events and ensure safe and timely delivery of radiation therapy. The New York Proton Center (NYPC) is a high-volume free-standing multi-institutional proton center located in Manhattan. The purpose of this report is to describe the institutional patient experience and quantify the impact of treatment delays and interruptions over the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak. We also quantify the incidence of COVID-19 positive patients on census and provide guidance on proactive institutional policies to mitigate patient risk. Copyright © 2020, Press et al.	false
0	Temporal detection and phylogenetic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 has recently been detected in feces, which indicates that wastewater may be used to monitor viral prevalence in the community. Here we use two different sampling methods to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater over a 17-day period and sequencing is used to infer viral ancestry. While SARS-CoV-2 is detected over the entire time course, viral RNA has been steadily decreasing over the last week, suggesting that state mandated social isolation is having a measurable impact on containment of the outbreak.	false
0	Oral saliva and COVID-19. Outbreak pneumonia announced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, had its causative factor classified as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Since saliva can host several viruses including SARS-CoV-2, the transmission chance of viruses through saliva, particularly those causing respiratory infections, is unavoidable. COVID-19 can be detected through salivary diagnostic testing which has lots of advantages for medical care professionals and patients. It should be noted that not only does saliva offer an ecological niche for the colonization and development of oral microorganisms, but it also prevents the overgrowth of particular pathogens such as viral factors. The aim of this study is to gather all the information about saliva and its association with COVID-19 for the whole health care professionals across the world. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	Comparison of immunogenicity between intradermal and intramuscular injections of repeated annual identical influenza virus strains post-pandemic (2011-2012) in COPD patients. We compared the antibody responses and persistence of the reduced-dose, 9 micro g hemagglutinin (HA)/strain intradermal (ID) injection via the Mantoux technique and the 15 mug HA/strain intramuscular (IM) injection of the repeated annual identical trivalent, inactivated, split-virion vaccine 2011-2012 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Eighty patients were randomized to ID (n = 41) and IM (n = 39) groups. Four weeks post-vaccination, the antibody responses of the two groups were similar; those for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2)-but not influenza B-met the criteria of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). The antibody responses for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 rapidly declined in both groups, especially with the ID injection, whereas those for influenza A(H3N2) maintained above the CPMP criteria throughout 12 months post-vaccination. The geometric mean titres for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 persisted above the protective threshold (>= 40) until 6 months post-vaccination in both the ID and IM groups. The seroprotection rates of the ID and IM groups were above 60% until 3 months and 6 months post-vaccination, respectively. In conclusion, the 9 mug HA/strain ID injection of vaccine 2011-2012 elicited antibody responses similar to the standard dose of 15 mug of the HA/strain IM injection at 4 weeks post-vaccination. However, the antibody responses for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 rapidly declined, especially in the case of the ID injection, whereas they were comparable for influenza A(H3N2). Additional strategies for increasing vaccine durability should be considered, especially for new pandemic strains affecting elderly COPD patients.	false
0	CREST-2 experience with the evolving challenges of COVID-19: A clinical trial in a pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disrupted the lives of whole communities and nations. The multinational multicenter National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial stroke prevention trial rapidly experienced the effects of the pandemic and had to temporarily suspend new enrollments and shift patient follow-up activities from in-person clinic visits to telephone contacts. There is an ethical obligation to the patients to protect their health while taking every feasible step to ensure that the goals of the trial are successfully met. Here, we describe the effects of the pandemic on the trial and steps that are being taken to mitigate the effects of the pandemic so that trial objectives can be met.

0	[The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China]. Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild/mild pneumonia (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.	false
0	Use of face coverings by the public during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study. Public health agencies have recommended that the public wear face coverings as a major non-pharmaceutical intervention to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. However, there is concern whether or not the public has adopted this recommendation. An observational study of 3,271 members of the public was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the use of face coverings at grocery stores across 20 Wisconsin counties between May 16th and June 1st, 2020. Of the total individuals observed, we found that only 41.2% used face coverings. Individuals who appeared to be adults (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20-2.27) or older adults (aOR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.59-5.19) were more likely to be wearing face coverings than younger individuals. Additionally, individuals with female gender expression (aOR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.24-1.66) and individuals shopping at a more expensive grocery store (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.69-2.25) were more likely to be wearing face coverings. We did not find an association between county level prevalence of COVID-19 cases and face covering use. To our knowledge, this is the first study using direct observations to examine face covering behavior by the public and our findings have implications for public health agencies.	false
0	Detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in both serum and saliva enhances detection of infection. BACKGROUND: Detecting antibody responses during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential in determining the seroepidemiology of the virus and the potential role of antibody in disease. Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect., METHODS: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects., RESULTS: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting., CONCLUSIONS: Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection., FUNDING: This work was funded by the University of Birmingham, the National Institute for Health Research (UK), the NIH National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the University of Southampton.	false
0	Lifestyle Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease in Relation to COVID-19 Hospitalization: A Community-Based Cohort Study of 387,109 Adults in UK. Aims: It is important to identify characteristics of people who may be most at risk of COVID-19 to inform policy and intervention. Little is known about the impact of unhealthy lifestyles including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake. We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for COVID-19., Methods: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 +/-8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020., Results: There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52 - 7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19., Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, accounting for up to half of severe cases. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.	false
0	Structure-based Design of Prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spikes. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to accelerated efforts to develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines to mitigate this public health emergency. A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric class I fusion protein that is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly in large quantities. Here, we designed and expressed over 100 structure-guided spike variants based upon a previously determined cryo-EM structure of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike. Biochemical, biophysical and structural characterization of these variants identified numerous individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. The best variant, HexaPro, has six beneficial proline substitutions leading to ~10-fold higher expression than its parental construct and is able to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaws. A 3.2 A-resolution cryo-EM structure of HexaPro confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	The D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike increases transduction of multiple human cell types. Recently, a novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence, including the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Wuhan, China. This Spike variant is a defining feature of the most prevalent clade (A2a) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide. Using phylogenomic data, several groups have proposed that the D614G variant may confer increased transmissibility leading to positive selection, while others have claimed that currently available evidence does not support positive selection. Furthermore, in the A2a clade, this mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with a ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on a human codon-optimized spike protein to introduce the D614G variant and produce SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (S-Virus) with this variant and with D614 Spike. We show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that S-Virus carrying the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type S-Virus. This provides functional evidence that the D614G mutation in the Spike protein increases transduction of human cells. Further we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to cleavage in vitro and in human cells, which may suggest a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. Given that several vaccines in development and in clinical trials are based on the initial (D614) Spike sequence, this result has important implications for the efficacy of these vaccines in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.	false
0	Ocular manifestations and viral shedding in tears of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a preliminary report. PURPOSE: To evaluate ocular manifestations and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence in the tears of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: A total of 27 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection hospitalized from March 16 to April 15, 2020, at the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital were enrolled in the study. At admission, all patients showed ocular manifestations. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were performed every 2-3 days before discharge., RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 4 (15%) were asymptomatic, 15 (56%) showed respiratory symptoms, and 8 (30%) had gastrointestinal symptoms. At admission, nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for COVID-19 in all patients; on the second swabs, 7 children (26%) tested negative, and 20 remained positive for COVID-19. Ocular manifestations consistent with mild viral conjunctivitis were observed in 4 patients (15%). At first conjunctival swab, 3 patients (11%), 1 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic for ocular infection, had positive findings for COVID-19; 2 became negative on the second test and 1 on the third., CONCLUSIONS: In our study cohort, ocular manifestations of COVID-19 seem to have had a milder clinical course in pediatric patients than in adults. Despite the low prevalence and rapid regression of viral presence in the conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through tears may be possible, even in patients without apparent ocular involvement.

0	Decrease in Hospital Admissions for Transient Ischemic Attack, Mild, and Moderate Stroke During the COVID-19 Era. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since the onset of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, doctors and public authorities have demonstrated concern about the reduction in quality of care for other health conditions due to social restrictions and lack of resources. Using a population-based stroke registry, we investigated the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in stroke admissions in Joinville, Brazil., METHODS: Patients admitted after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions in the city (defined as March 17, 2020) were compared with those admitted in 2019. We analyzed differences between stroke incidence, types, severity, reperfusion therapies, and time from stroke onset to admission. Statistical tests were also performed to compare the 30 days before and after COVID-19 to the same period in 2019., RESULTS: We observed a decrease in total stroke admissions from an average of 12.9/100 000 per month in 2019 to 8.3 after COVID-19 (P=0.0029). When compared with the same period in 2019, there was a 36.4% reduction in stroke admissions. There was no difference in admissions for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >8), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage., CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admissions for transient, mild, and moderate strokes. Given the need to prevent the worsening of symptoms and the occurrence of medical complications in these groups, a reorganization of the stroke-care networks is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by COVID-19.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and assessment of coronaviruses in CNS diseases with a focus on therapeutic targets. The novel Coronavirus disease of 2019 (nCOV-19) is a viral outbreak noted first in Wuhan, China. This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus. We also focus on the virus genome, pathophysiology, theranostics, and autophagy mechanisms. We will assess the multiorgan failure reported in advanced stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our paper will provide mechanistic clues and therapeutic targets for physicians and investigators to combat COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false

In related SARS-CoV-1, 3a is implicated in viral release, inflammasome activation, and cell death and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in animal models, suggesting 3a-targeted therapeutics could treat SARS and COVID-19. However, the structural basis for the function of 3a is unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-2 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in Alpha- and Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.	false
0	Early-Morning vs Spot Posterior Oropharyngeal Saliva for Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Implication of Timing of Specimen Collection for Community-Wide Screening. Background: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva is increasingly recognized as a valid respiratory specimen for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. It is easy to collect and suitable for community-wide screening. The optimal timing of collection is currently unknown, and we speculate that an early-morning specimen before oral hygiene and breakfast would increase the diagnostic yield., Methods: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva was collected at 5 different time points within the same day from 18 patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular testing. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared., Results: There was an overall trend of lower Ct values from specimens collected in the early morning, with a gradual decrease of viral load towards nighttime, but reaching statistical significance only when compared with the specimens collected at bedtime. Eight out of 13 subjects had a higher viral load in the early morning than the rest of the 4 time points (before lunch, before teatime at 3 pm, before dinner, before bedtime)., Conclusions: The result suggests a diurnal variation of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract with a trend showing higher viral load in the early morning. For community screening purposes, posterior oropharyngeal saliva could be taken throughout the day, but preferably in the early morning to maximize the yield. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.	false
0	Variation in volumes and characteristics of trauma patients admitted to a level one trauma centre during national level 4 lockdown for COVID-19 in New Zealand. AIM: The aims of this study were to describe the variation in volumes and types of injuries admitted to a level one trauma centre in New Zealand over two 14-day periods before and during the national level 4 lockdown for COVID-19; and highlight communities at risk of preventable injury that may impact negatively on hospital resources., METHOD: A retrospective, descriptive study of prospectively collected data in the Midland Trauma Registry in New Zealand., RESULTS: Overall there was a reduction of 43% in all injury-related admissions with significant reductions seen in major injury (50% reduction), males (50% reduction) and children aged 0-14 years (48% reduction). Results for ethnicity and persons aged over 14 years were within 3% deviation of this overall 43% reduction. Injuries at home, particularly falls, predominate., CONCLUSION: Despite the significant reduction in admissions during level 4 lockdown, hospitals should continue to provide full services until resource limitations are unavoidable. Immediate messaging is recommended to reduce rates of injury on the farm and at home, specifically falls prevention. Ongoing attention of road users to road safety is essential to reduce the incidence of preventable major injury. These immediate measures can potentially reduce unnecessary pressure on hospital beds and resources during the pandemic.	false

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination. A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.

Several studies suggested that the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism but the incidence of thrombotic complications in the late phase of the disease is currently unknown. The present article describes three cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and late occurrence of pulmonary embolism. Case 1: a 57-year-old man diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and type B aortic dissection after 12 days from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Laboratory panel at the time of pulmonary embolism showed no signs of ongoing inflammation but only an elevated D-dimer. Case 2: a 76-year-old man with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia followed by pulmonary embolism 20 days later, high-resolution computed tomography on that time showed a partial resolution of crazy paving consolidation. Case 3: a 77-year-old man with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who developed a venous thromboembolic event despite thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Also in this patients no markers of inflammation were present at the time of complication. The present cases raise the possibility that in SARS-CoV-2 infection the hypercoagulable state may persist over the active inflammation phase and cytokine storm. These findings suggest a role for medium-long term therapeutic anticoagulation started at the time of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosis.	false
0	"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic: current situation and implications for Mexico. The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is one of the most devastating in this century. It originated in China in December 2019 caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, and in less than a month it had been classified as an ""International Public Health Emergency"". To date there are nearly 3 million people infected and more than 250,000 deaths caused by the disease worldwide. Initially it affects the respiratory tract with atypical pneumonia and in severe cases it produces systemic inflammation with cytokine storm that can cause rapid deterioration with circulatory and respiratory failure, coagulopathy and a lethality rate of approximately 7%. In Mexico, the first case was detected in February 2020, and to date there are 26,616 confirmed cases and 2,961 deaths throughout the country. The low number of diagnostic tests conducted in our country clearly underestimates the real incidence and impact of the disease. The most affected groups are those with risk factors such as age over 60, presence of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Of the confirmed cases, 15% are healthcare workers. There is no specific treatment or vaccine yet, so it is important to have hygiene, social isolation and personal protection measures. Health, social and economic consequences could have great impact in the near future. Copyright: © 2020 Permanyer."	false
0	Renal cell carcinoma and COVID-19 pandemia: Management strategies adapted to current practice. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an important health impact that has affected renal cell carcinoma management, among other urology areas. The high cancellation rate of surgeries, including those related to renal cancer, will cause an inevitable healthcare overload and probably a potential negative impact on its oncological outcomes, especially in locally advanced and metastatic renal cancer. Kidney cancer scenarios are quite different depending on their stage, distinguishing mainly between low priority of localized disease or high priority of locally advanced and metastatic under active treatment. The unknown pandemic duration and possibly fluctuating prevalence of the virus are likely to force an adaptation in the management of renal cell carcinoma among urology and oncology departments, ideally individualized ona case-by-case basis within multidisciplinary units. To this end, we present algorithms and tables regarding renal cell carcinoma management adapted to the COVID-19 period and stratified according to oncological stage, which might be useful for specialists dedicated to this uro-oncology area.	false
0	Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Markers in SARS-COV-2 Infection and Pneumonia: Case-Control Study. BACKGROUND/AIM: A novel human coronavirus, named SARS-COV-2, has recently caused thousands of deaths all around the world. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in the development of diseases., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We aimed to to investigate the relationship between ER stress markers in patients infected with SARS-COV-2 and patients with pneumonia. A total of 9 patients (4 patients diagnosed with pneumonia and 5 patients diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 infection) who admitted to the emergency Department with symptoms of pneumonia and SARS-COV-2 were included in the study. A total of 18 healthy individuals without any known chronic or acute disease and drug use were included as the healthy control group. Serum human glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), serum human C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and serum human phospho extracellular signal regulated kinase (PERK) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., RESULTS: GRP78 levels were found to be significantly higher in SARS-COV-2 positive cases compared to individuals in other groups. Serum GRP-78 level median value was statistically significantly higher in SARS-COV-2-positive group compared to the other groups (p=0.0003). Serum PERK level was statistically significantly higher in SARS-COV-2-positive pneumonia cases (p=0.046)., CONCLUSION: An association was shown between GRP78 and SARS-COV-2 infection. Although a small number of patients was investigated, these results will be important and guide future treatments of SARS-COV-2.

0	Clinicopathological characteristics of 8697 patients with COVID-19 in China: a meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to present a summary of the clinicopathological characteristics of patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions. DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULT(S): A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSION(S): The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Clinical Profile of Covid-19 Infected Patients Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India. Background: The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) continues to wreck havoc across China, European countries, USA and now seems to gain a strong foothold in India. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical profiles of these Covid-19 infected patients admitted in Sawai Mansingh Hospital(S.M.S), Jaipur ranging from their age, sex, travel history, clinical symptoms, laboratory evaluation, radiological characteristics, treatment provided along with common side effects and the final outcome. The described cases are one of the earliest cases of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent., Methods: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA., Results and Discussion: During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment., Conclusion: Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.

0	Clinical performance of different SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests. SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies. So far, there is limited data on how commercially available tests perform with real patient samples and if positive tested samples show neutralizing abilities. Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in-house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay. For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18). With exception of one sample, all positive tested COVID-19 follow up-samples, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing properties in the PRNT. Regarding specificity, some samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result.

0	Clinical Features of 85 Fatal Cases of COVID-19 from Wuhan. A Retrospective Observational Study. Rationale: The global death toll from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) virus as of May 12, 2020, exceeds 286,000. The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined. Objective(s): To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan. Method(s): Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management.Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]), and glucocorticoid (65 [76.5%]) treatments. A total of 38 (44.7%) and 33 (38.8%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and IFN-alpha2b, respectively. Conclusion(s): In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis. A combination of antimicrobial drugs did not offer considerable benefit to the outcome of this group of patients.	false
0	Association of viral load with serum biomakers among COVID-19 cases. Since SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, data have been needed on the natural fluctuation of viral load and clinical indicators associated with it. We measured and compared viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from pharyngeal swab, IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2, CRP and SAA from serum of 114 COVID-19 patients on admission. Positive rates of IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2, CRP and SAA were 80.7%, 36% and 75.4% respectively. Among IgM-positive patients, viral loads showed different trends among cases with different severity, While viral loads of IgM-negative patients tended to increase along with the time after onset. As the worsening of severity, the positive rates of CRP and SAA also showed trends of increase. Different CRP/SAA type showed associations with viral loads in patients in different severity and different time after onset. Combination of the IgM and CRP/SAA with time after onset and severity may give suggestions on the viral load and condition judgment of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Optimizing your telemedicine visit during the COVID-19 pandemic: Practice guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer. The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in many hospitals and practices to cancel in-person outpatient clinic visits, where head and neck patients receive their critical longitudinal care. Out of necessity, most practices have been encouraged to use telemedicine as a method to maintain a continuum of care with their patients. As a result, the prevalence of telemedicine has grown rapidly during this pandemic, without allowing the physicians and patients to be adequately educated on how best to utilize the services. There is a steep learning curve as we have learned, and our goal is to provide guidelines for both patients and physicians, as well as a valuable patient handout in preparation for their visit.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false

0	'Scientific Strabismus' or two related pandemics: coronavirus disease and vitamin D deficiency. The WHO has announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5-11degreeC and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33.4 %; Chile 26.4 %) and mid-latitude (France 27.3 %; Portugal 21.2 %; Austria 19.3 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.	false
0	CoViD-19 Immunopathology and Immunotherapy. New evidence on the T-cell immuno-pathology in patient's with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) was reported by Diao et al. in MedRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364) [1]. It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed. Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19. Copyright © 2020 Biomedical Informatics.	false

0	White Matter Integrity in Tanzanian Children With Sickle Cell Anemia: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study. Background and Purpose - Widespread reductions in white matter integrity are associated with cognitive dysfunction in sickle cell anemia. Silent cerebral infarction (SCI), vasculopathy (VSC), and low hemoglobin concentration (Hb) are implicated; we aimed to determine independent contributions to microstructural white matter injury and whether white matter integrity differs across arterial territories. Methods- Sixty two children with sickle cell anemia aged 6 to 19 years were prospectively studied at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCI+/- and VSC+/- were identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans by 2 neuroradiologists. Tract-based spatial statistics tested for voxel-wise differences in diffusion tensor imaging metrics (ie, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) between SCI+/- and VSC+/- groups, with correlations between diffusion tensor imaging metrics and Hb. In tract-based spatial statistics analyses, potentially mediating factors (ie, age, sex, as well as Hb, SCI, and/or vasculopathy) were covariates. Differences in mean diffusion tensor imaging metrics across regions of interest in arterial territories were explored. Results - Compared with SCI- patients (n=45), SCI+ patients (n=17) exhibited increased radial diffusivity in multiple regions; negative relationships were observed between mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and Hb (P<0.005). Compared with VSC- patients (n=49), mild (n=6) or moderate (n=7) VSC+ patients exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy in widespread regions (P<0.05) including the anterior longitudinal fasciculi, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, and corticospinal tracts. Overall, the posterior cerebral arterial territory had higher mean mean diffusivity and mean radial diffusivity than the anterior and middle cerebral arterial territories, although no patient had vasculopathy in this area. There was an interaction between territory and vasculopathy. Conclusions - SCI, vasculopathy, and Hb are independent risk factors, and thus treatment targets, for diffuse white matter injury in patients with sickle cell anemia. Exacerbation of hemodynamic stress may play a role.	false
0	Guidance for the care of neuromuscular patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak from the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network. In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers. In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

0	Expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) as a therapeutic strategy in managing critically ILL COVID-19 patients: The case for compassionate use. COVID-19 has affected the United States leading to a national emergency with health care and economic impact, propelling the country into a recession with disrupted lifestyles not seen in recent history. COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients. In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis... 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance. 2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors. 3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.Copyright © 2020, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

0	Prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic infected individuals. BACKGROUND: Duration of persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals has important clinical and epidemiological implications., AIM: We aimed to establish the duration and risk factors for persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic infected individuals., METHODS: Data of repeat rRT-PCR test done for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at our institute at Jodhpur, India was analysed from 19 March- 21 May 2020. Duration of virus persistence was estimated with parametric regression models based on Weibull, Log-normal, Log-logistic, Gamma and Generalized Gamma distributions. Factors associated with prolonged viral persistence were analysed with the best fitting model., RESULTS: 51 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with repeat rRT-PCR test were identified with 44 asymptomatics. The asymptomatic individuals had median virus persistence duration of 8.87 days (95%CI: 7.65 - 10.27) and 95 percentile duration of 20.70 days (95% CI: 16.08 -28.20). The overall median virus persistence including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was found to be 9.18 days (95 CI 8.04 - 10.48). Around one-fourth asymptomatics (10/44) demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 persistence beyond 2 weeks. Age < 60 years and local transmission were found to be significantly associated with longer virus persistence among asymptomatic individuals on univariate regression but not in multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Recommended home isolation duration for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India should be extended from 17 days to at least three weeks. Prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a proportion of asymptomatic individuals merits attention with regard to ensuring universal infection prevention precautions irrespective of symptomatic status.

0	Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 with Convalescent Plasma. Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments. Objective(s): To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Result(s): All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 American Medical Association.

0	Early Data From Case Series of Tracheostomy in Patients With SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-eight tracheostomies were performed on patients with respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection over the month of April at North Shore University Hospital and Lenox Hill Hospital (members of Northwell Health System in Long Island and New York City). Follow-up by May 14 revealed that 21 (55.2%) had been weaned from ventilators and 7 (18.4%) underwent decannulation. Two patients (5.3%) expired in the weeks following tracheostomy. Between the 2 institutions, 10 attending surgeons performed all of the tracheostomies using appropriate personal protective equipment, and none demonstrated seroconversion within 1 to 2 weeks of this article.	false
0	Tocilizumab in the Treatment of Coronavirus Induced Disease (COVID-19). Background and Rationale The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China, is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis, and, on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits. The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease, COVID‐19, has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 3.7%, which is more than 10‐fold higher than the mortality of influenza. An infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 may cause an excessive host immune response, leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine‐Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID‐19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d‐dimer and low platelets. There is increasing evidence, that cytokine‐targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID‐19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID‐19. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti‐IL‐6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the elderly). Collectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway induced by IL‐6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID‐19 prone to CRS and ARDS.	false
0	Potent Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Identified by High-Throughput Single-Cell Sequencing of Convalescent Patients' B Cells. The COVID-19 pandemic urgently needs therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. Here, we report the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from 60 convalescent patients. From 8,558 antigen-binding IgG1+ clonotypes, 14 potent neutralizing antibodies were identified, with the most potent one, BD-368-2, exhibiting an IC50 of 1.2 and 15 ng/mL against pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8 A cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody's epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases., Neutralizing antibodies, which could effectively block virus entry into host cells, are urgently needed for intervention against COVID-19. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, Cao et al. identified fourteen potent neutralizing antibodies from 60 convalescent patients' B cells. The most potent antibody, BD-368-2, exhibits high therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections. The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development., Lv et al. examine the antibody responses from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. The results show that cross-reactive binding to the spike protein is common, whereas cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice, income, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urologists. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice, income, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urologists during the month of April 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 39-question, web-based survey was sent to all urologist members of the Brazilian Society of Urology. We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. RESULT(S): Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction >= 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of >= 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p< 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95%CI 1.74-10.54, p=0.012). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.

0	Iatrogenic dermatitis in times of COVID-19: A pandemic within a pandemic. The pandemic of the 21st century, COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China and swiftly became a global phenomenon. The frontline barriers for preventing spread are hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE). The amplified hygiene practices and PPE as recommended have brought in its wake a second pandemic- a pandemic of dermatitis!. We reviewed the most prevalent types of iatrogenic skin damage among health-care workers (HCWs), notably irritant, and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to PPE and hand-hygiene measures, as well as face mask induced pressure-related skin damage.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model. The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Precautions and recommendations for orthodontic settings during the COVID-19 outbreak: A review. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories. The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children. It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets. The practice of social distancing - maintaining a distance of 1 - 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread. This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis. This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility. Method(s): A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics. Result(s): This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures. Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak. Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required. Conclusion(s): Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings. Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging. Further studies are required.Copyright © 2020.	false
0	SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy and fetal development. Recently, in China, in 2019, a new type of disease has arisen caused by a new strain of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, considered extremely worrying due to its high infectivity power and the easy ability to spread geographically. For patients in general, the clinical features resulting from respiratory syndromes can trigger an asymptomatic condition. However, 25% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress to severity. Pregnant women are an unknown field in this complex process, and although they have symptoms similar to non-pregnant women, some points should be considered, such as complications during pregnancy and postpartum. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the consequences on pregnancy and fetal development, caused by infections by the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Among the aforementioned infections, MERS-CoV seems to be the most dangerous for newborns, inducing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and multiple organ failure in mother. This also causes a higher occurrence of emergency cesarean deliveries and premature births, in addition, some deaths of mothers and fetuses were recorded. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appears to have less severe symptoms. Furthermore, although a study found the ACE2 receptor, used by SARS-CoV-2, widely distributed in specific cell types of the maternal-fetal interface, there is no evidence of vertical transmission for any of the coronaviruses. Thus, the limited reported obstetric cases alert to the need for advanced life support for pregnant women infected with coronaviruses and to the need for further investigation for application in clinical practice.

0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Mimicking as Pulmonary Tuberculosis in an Inmate. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global infectious disease with emerging medical knowledge. Clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is very variable amongst patients, and the literature about unusual presentations is growing rapidly. This lack of knowledge leads to diagnostic, therapeutic, and management challenges in such patients. Here, we describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low prevalence area which was initially diagnosed and managed as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a high-risk inmate population. These ambiguous presentations can lead to mismanagement of such patients resulting in potentially fatal outcomes and public health crises in confined facilities. This also highlights the significance of a high index of clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 especially in high risk and vulnerable populations. Copyright © 2020, Akbar et al.	false
0	Neurologic and Radiographic Findings Associated With COVID-19 Infection in Children. Importance: Neurological manifestations have been reported in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the highly pathogenic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., Objective: To report the neurological manifestations of children with COVID-19., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-series study, patients younger than 18 years who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (London, UK) between March 1, 2020, and May 8, 2020, were included after infection was confirmed by either a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay by nasopharyngeal swab or a positive test result for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum., Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient records., Results: Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies had negative results in all patients. In all 3 patients who underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography, mild myopathic and neuropathic changes were seen. Neurological improvement was seen in all patients, with 2 making a complete recovery by the end of the study., Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-series study, children with COVID-19 presented with new neurological symptoms involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems and splenial changes on imaging, in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Additional research is needed to assess the association of neurological symptoms with immune-mediated changes among children with COVID-19.	false
0	Management of central nervous system demyelinating diseases during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: a practical approach. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a potential threat to patients with autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Such patients are usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper with the organism's normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic., OBJECTIVE: To discuss strategies to manage those patients., METHODS: We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies, such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk (interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab, when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: In the future, real-world case series of MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19 will help us define the best management strategies. For the time being, we rely on expert experience and guidance.	false

0	Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency: An Actionable Risk Factor for Patients with COVID-19?. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common X-linked mutation that is more prevalent in African, Asian, Latin American and Mediterranean populations. Although most individuals are asymptomatic, exposure to certain food, drugs, or infections can trigger acute hemolytic anemia. Given the potential for coronavirus to trigger oxidative stress, unrecognized G6PD deficiency in the presence of the COVID-19 viral infection may cause hemolytic crisis and worse outcome in affected individuals. Further, since certain drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19 infection may cause hemolytic crisis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, it may be warranted to recommend adding G6PD deficiency to the list of screening elements in a COVID-19 workup for those patients where there is a high suspicion for this genetic mutation.Copyright © 2020 IMSS	false
0	"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody-containing Plasma thErapy. Investigators are doing this research to learn more about high‐titer COVID‐19 convalescent plasma (HT‐CCP) transfusion as a possible treatment for people who have COVID‐19, the coronavirus infection. ""HT‐CCP"" is plasma that contains a high amount of antibodies that were made to fight off COVID‐19 because it is donated by another person who has also been infected with coronavirus but has recovered, so their immune system has had enough time to make these antibodies. This study is being done to determine whether HT‐CCP will help people with COVID‐19 recover from their infection more quickly and lower their risk of having to go on a ventilator or reduce the time they need to stay on a ventilator. It is not yet known whether HT‐CCP helps people with COVID‐19, which is why the study needs to be randomized, meaning some subjects will be randomly selected to receive HT‐CCP while others will be randomly selected to receive FFP."	false
0	Donated Antibodies Working Against nCoV. In December 2019, a new coronavirus (the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus) emerged, which spread fast across the world, and has led to a pandemic. The disease caused by this virus, called COVID‐19, has a mild course in a high number of infected people, but is known to have a more severe course in some. Currently, there are no successful treatments with a known effect on the course of the disease in patients suffering from COVID‐19. In this study, we will examine whether plasma, a treatment that has been used in human subjects for other diseases (and is known to be safe), can be used to influence the course of COVID‐19 towards a lower severity. The aim of the study is to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for COVID‐19. This clinical trial is an adaptive, randomized, open‐label phase II proof‐of‐concept study to investigate the safety and effect of potentially interesting treatments, for the treatment of hospitalized adult patients suffering from COVID‐19. Because an active treatment for COVID‐19 is lacking, plasma donation is now being proposed. To investigate this effect of plasma, we will compare two groups of patients. One group will get standard treatment, plus plasma from a patient recently cured from COVID‐19. A second group will get standard treatment alone. In this study, 2 patients out of 3 will receive plasma, and 1 patient out of 3 will receive standard treatment alone. After the study, we will be able to establish whether plasma donation is useful or not.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically overt SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases residing in Tuscany, and to compare it with that observed in the general Tuscan population. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. Result(s): 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab). Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications. Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20-0.21%), p = .597]. Conclusion(s): Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The Relationship between Status at Presentation and Outcomes among Pregnant Women with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE:  This study was aimed to compare maternal and pregnancy outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN:  This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women were divided into two groups based on status at admission, symptomatic or asymptomatic. All testing was done by nasopharyngeal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery. Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. RESULT(S):  Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [n=60] or exposure only [n=21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic). In total, there were 46 symptomatic women and 22 asymptomatic women (tested based on exposure only [n=12] or as part of universal screening [n=10]) with confirmed COVID-19. Of symptomatic women (n=46), 27.3% had preterm delivery and 26.1% needed respiratory support while none of the asymptomatic women (n=22) had preterm delivery or need of respiratory support (p=0.007 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION(S):  Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women. It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms. KEY POINTS: . Respiratory support is often needed for women who present with symptoms.. . Low rate of severe disease in women who present without symptoms.. . There were no neonatal infections on day 0 of life..Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false

The etiological agent was quickly identified as a betacoronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2), which has since caused a pandemic. Several methods allowing for the specific detection of viral nucleic acids have been established, but these only allow detection of the virus during a short period of time, generally during acute infection. Serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys, to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection. Here we describe a detailed protocol for expression of antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that can serve as a substrate for immunological assays, as well as a two-stage serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These assays can be used for research studies and for testing in clinical laboratories. © 2020 The Authors. Current Protocols in Microbiology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Mammalian cell transfection and protein purification. Basic Protocol 2: A two-stage ELISA for high-throughput screening of human serum samples for antibodies binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing explosive epidemic of COVID19 disease has generated a need for assays to rapidly and conveniently measure the antiviral activity of SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The assays described herein are adaptable to high throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation of serologic immunity conferred by vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the potency of convalescent plasma or human monoclonal antibodies.	false
0	Sequential analysis of viral load in a neonate and her mother infected with SARS-CoV-2. We report changes in viral load over time in a 27-day old neonate with COVID-19 who presented with fever, cough, and vomiting. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, stool, saliva, plasma, and urine. The highest viral RNA copies in nasopharynx decreased over time while viral load in stool remained high.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Tocilizumab treatment in COVID-19: A single center experience. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently. In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment. TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false

The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching impacts around the world, causing substantial disruptions to health and health care systems that are likely to last for a prolonged period. Early data have suggested that having cancer is a significant risk factor for mortality from severe COVID-19. A diverse group of medical oncologists met to formulate detailed practical advice on systemic anticancer treatments during this crisis. In the context of broad principles, issues including risks of treatment, principles of prioritizing resources, treatment of elderly patients, and psychosocial impact are discussed. Detailed treatment advice and options are given at a tumor stream level. We must maintain care for patients with cancer as best we can and recognize that COVID-19 poses a significant competing risk for death that changes conventional treatment paradigms.	false
0	First case of drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of tocilizumab in a patient with COVID-19. Background and Aims: Tocilizumab (TCZ; interleukine-6 receptor antagonist) has been proposed to treat severe forms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) because interleukine-6 plays an important role in COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. Method(s): We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. Result(s): One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. Conclusion(s): This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

0	Society of gynecologic oncology surgery considerations during when to operate, hesitate and reintegrate the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our ability to provide timely surgical care for our patients. In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand. The purpose of this white paper is to highlight all phases of gynecologic cancer surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate when it is best to operate, to hestitate, and reintegrate surgery. Triage and prioritization of surgical cases, preoperative COVID-19 testing, peri-operative safety principles, and preparations for the post-COVID-19 peak and surgical reintegration are reviewed.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Molecular Targets in the Chemotherapy of Coronavirus Infection. In the pathogenesis of the infectious process in the respiratory tract by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses, two stages can be distinguished: early (etiotropic) and late (pathogenetic) ones. In the first stage, when the virus multiplication and accumulation are prevalent under insufficient host immune response, the use of chemotherapeutic agents blocking the reproduction of the virus is reasonable to suppress the development of the disease. This article considers six major chemotherapeutic classes aimed at certain viral targets: inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase, inhibitors of viral protease Mpro, inhibitors of proteolytic activation of viral protein S allowing virus entry into the target cell, inhibitors of virus uncoating in cellular endosomes, compounds of exogenous interferons, and compounds of natural and recombinant virus-neutralizing antibodies. In the second stage, when the multiplication of the virus decreases and threatening pathological processes of excessive inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis events develop, a pathogenetic therapeutic approach including extracorporeal blood oxygenation, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial therapy seems to be the most effective way for the patient's recovery.	false
0	Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody. The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	"The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial. Prevention strategies are key in limiting the transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza. Among non‐pharmacologic interventions, there is intense interest in the use of facial protective equipment (FPE) ‐ medical masks (MM) or N95 respirators (N95) ‐ as a key component of personal protective equipment (PPE) when faced with respiratory illness including influenza. However, their relative protective effect is unknown, especially in the outpatient setting (OPD). To plan for future epidemics and best manage limited supplies of FPE, evidence is needed to guide planning activities and policy makers. This project aims to answer a key question: How do N95s protect healthcare workers (HCWs) in the OPD against influenza, influenza‐like illness (ILI), acute respiratory illness (ARI) and other causes of respiratory illnesses including respiratory viral illness (RV), as compared to MMs? The study outcomes are to: ‐ determine the most effective FPE equipment to use to prevent disease transmission in the OPD during an influenza outbreak, epidemic or pandemic event. ‐ the incidence of organism‐specific rates of ARI in the OPD during the RV season. ‐ the incidence rate of organism‐specific respiratory viral infections in the OPD. Clinics (or their functional partitions) will be randomized into either the N95 or MM arm using a stratified randomization scheme to ensure comparability between the two arms. All participants, regardless of study arm, will be fit‐tested for an N95. The study will require a 16‐18 week period that will be initiated when viral surveillance data indicates that influenza season has begun. Participants will be recruited through informational meetings with clinic staff. Participants will have blood drawn before week 1 and after the end of the active portion of the study to assess seroconversion over the study period to capture the incidence of non‐symptomatic influenza. All participants will fill out a pre‐study survey and post on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding influenza, influenza vaccinations, and appropriate PPE. During the first week, participants will fill out a form with basic demographic and workplace information. Participants will be asked to 1. wear participant's appropriate FPE when in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed influenza or RV for the next 12‐16 weeks; 2. fill out a daily form assessing exposure to ILI and FPE use, and weekly forms assessing RV symptoms and medication use. The investigators will collect nasal and throat (pharyngeal) swabs twice during the study for all participants, and when participants report having an ILI or ARI. Study staff will make unannounced visits to the clinics to observe FPE and hand hygiene compliance rates. Participants will be compensated for participation (as detailed below). To be included the clinical site leadership has agreed to have one of more participants in the trial. To be included the subject(s): (1) meets the definition of ""healthcare personnel"" (2) is able to read and sign informed consent (3) agrees to all requirements of the protocol, including fit testing and diary keeping (4) is 18 years old or greater (6) passes fit testing for one of the study supplied N95 and agrees to use that model for the entire 16 week period of the study. Subjects are excluded if: (1) subject self‐identified as having severe heart, lung, neurological or other systemic disease that one or more Investigator believes could preclude safe participation (2) are known to not tolerate wearing FPE for any period (3) facial hair, or other issue such as facial adornments, preclude respirator Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)‐compliant fit testing or proper mask fit during the study period (4) subjects are advised by Occupational Health (or other qualified clinician) to not wear the same or similar respirator or medical mask models used in this study (5) in the opinion of the Investigator, may not be able to reasonably participate in the trial for any reason (6) Self‐identified as in, or will be in the third trimester of pregnancy, during the study period. Participants will be compensated for participation. Due to space limitations details are not presented here but are available from the overall study PI's. During the study period, study staff will be making unannounced visits to the clinics to measure hand hygiene and FPE compliance. The information collected will not be shared with the supervisors or administration of the clinics. Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) Analysis Plan 1. Analysis timeline and procedures A pre‐specified analysis plan for the primary manuscript of ResPECT was initially approved by all study principal and study‐site lead investigators on April 2016 and updated in May 2017 to reflect the addition of the Laboratory Detected Respiratory Infection (LDRI) outcome to the analysis. At the time of this revision (a) all data collection is complete, (b) all laboratory specimen samples have been tested for the primary and secondary outcomes, and (c) the database housing all of the ResPECT data contained no information about which clinics were assigned to which arm of the study. Once the analysis plan is updated and changes submitted to the site IRB's, the data coordinating center will release labels that identify separate arms of the study to the ResPECT statisticians who will use those codes to implement the analysis as described in this document. 2. General outline of analysis framework The ResPECT study was a cluster‐randomized trial that used constrained randomization (i.e. matching) to ensure balance across arms. The analysis described in this document is an unmatched analysis, i.e. the analysis does not explicitly account for the matching. This has been described as an appropriate approach to analyzing data arising from a matched design. The final analysis of ResPECT outcome data will consist of intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per‐protocol analyses (PP) for each of the five study outcomes defined below. For each analysis, the investigators will fit and report results from both adjusted and unadjusted models. Unadjusted models will be analyzed at the cluster‐level, and will only include a main effect estimate for the mask and the cluster‐level random effects to account for repeated measures of related clusters across multiple seasons. Adjusted models will be analyzed at the individual‐level and will include individual‐level covariates and random effects to account for repeated measures of the same individual across seasons. 2.a Intention‐to‐treat analysis The ITT analysis will include all of the ResPECT participants who were randomized— i.e., those assigned a mask based on participant's clinic affiliation. Participant's data will be included according to participant's treatment assignment, regardless of participant's adherence to protocol, subsequent withdrawal, failure to provide requested data/samples, or loss to follow‐up. This analysis is intended to capture a more realistic outcome of intervention by acknowledging that noncompliance and protocol deviations are an unavoidable part of clinical practice. In this study, any person who was eligible according to the baseline survey will be included in the ITT analysis. The outcomes for many participants will be missing, particularly those who withdrew during the course of the study. This missingness could conceivably be (a) related to outcome/illness status if individuals were more likely to quit the study because the individuals became sick, or (b) related to the assigned intervention if those assigned one mask over another were more likely to withdraw from study participation. The investigators will assess possible relationships between self‐reported reasons for withdrawal and measured variables. Approaches for imputing missing data are addressed below. 2.b Per‐protocol analysis Any participant who completed at least eight weeks of study participation will be included in the per protocol analysis. This strategy will include some participants who only had one blood draw or who are missing reliable serological data due to timing of or lack of information on vaccination (see Participant flow for ResPECT study analysis approaches showing ITT and per protocol cohorts and Decision Algorithm for serological influenza outcome adjudication below). These inclusion/exclusion criteria were decided on by the study PIs. The reasons for missing participant blood samples include loss to follow‐up with or without formal withdrawal/deactivation, sample loss due to handling/labeling error, or insufficient sample volume. Since the serologic definition of influenza seroconversion is a 4‐fold increase in titer, unpaired serology cannot be assigned an influenza seroconversion status and must be imputed. Missing serologic data will not exclude the patient from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐laboratory assessment. Hence, if an individual is missing a second blood draw but had lab‐confirmed influenza by PCR, then this individual will be considered to have had a lab‐confirmed influenza outcome. This may create non‐random missingness, but it was decided by PIs that since this would not impact many study participants the risk of bias to the overall study was very low. 2.c Handling of missing data via imputation methods There will be substantial missing data in the outcome (lab‐confirmed influenza) and other covariates. The missing data will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. Each of these datasets will be analyzed using the regression models described below. The results from all of the analyses will be pooled using standard multiple imputation techniques for combining estimates across imputed datasets. 2. d Process for determining participant membership in ITT and per protocol cohorts Participants signed informed consent. Those who failed to meet inclusion criteria or did not complete screening were excluded. Those who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to a mask group and formulate the ITT cohort. The 'per protocol' cohort will not include those who withdrew before participating (i.e., those who do not fill out any daily or weekly surveys), or discontinued the intervention (withdraw with less than 8 weeks of participation). The 'per protocol' cohort will include those who completed at least 8 weeks of study. The investigators define, for each participant, the amount of time that participants participated as the difference between the clinic activation date and latest of either the automatically‐generated time‐stamp of the last completed daily or weekly survey or the collection date of the last swab, with a maximum of 12 weeks. Those who participated for at least 8 weeks (56 days) according to this calculation will be included in the 'per protocol' cohort. For analyses using person time, the investigators will use the latest of the following; the last survey completed date or collection date from a swab collection. Decision Algorithm for serological influenza outcome adjudication: This decision algorithm documents the process for which ResPECT participants will be determined to have had laboratory‐confirmed influenza based on serological testing only. The possible outcomes are: laboratory confirmed influenza confirmed by serology (LCI‐S) and no laboratory confirmed influenza event confirmed by serology (no LCI‐S). In some cases, outcomes (either LCI‐S or no LCI‐S) will be imputed. The algorithm to classify and/or impute these outcomes is as follows: Step 1: Determine Study Completion Determine if participants have completed the study (and thus in the 'per protocol' cohort) or if participants have not and thus are in the ITT cohort Step 2: Determine serological influenza outcome for those in the 'per protocol' cohort 2a. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol, and who experience a four‐fold rise in influenza hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HAI) titer to exactly 0 strains, classify the serological influenza outcome as no LCI‐S. 2b. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol, and who experience a four‐fold rise in influenza HAI antibody titer to one or more strains, classify the serological influenza outcome as LCI‐S. 2c. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who do not have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol or who are missing vaccination info or were vaccinated during the study, impute the serological influenza outcome as LCI‐S. Missing LCI‐S status will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating multiple imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. Step 3: Impute the LCI‐S outcome for the ITT cohort Some members of the ITT cohort did not complete all weeks of the study and may be missing a serological outcome for the same reasons mentioned above. For these individuals, the serological influenza outcome must be imputed. Missing LCI‐S status will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating multiple imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. 2.d Model and variable selection This data is from a cluster‐randomized clinical trial. The investigators anticipate that the constrained randomization will ensure balance across important covariates. The clinics were pair‐matched by the following characteristics: Study site Clinic size Clinic type (ED/Urgent care, Primary Care, Outpatient, Enhanced) Enhanced PPE (whether HCWs wore enhanced PPE during patient procedures, e.g. in dental and dialysis clinics) Patient population (Pediatric, Adult, or mixed) Because these variables were matched on, the investigators will not adjust for any of them in the multivariable regression models. However, cluster‐level random intercepts as well as additional participant‐level covariates will be added to the model to adjust for possible residual confounding that is not controlled for by the cluster‐randomized design. These covariates will be individual‐level variables including: Age, Gender, Race (White, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino) Number of household members under 5 (this has been noted as a strong risk factor for influenza), Categorical occupation risk level (low, medium, or high), Binary season‐specific flu vaccination status (was or was not vaccinated), Proportion of daily surveys where an individual reported exposure to someone with respiratory symptoms, and Individual‐level (self‐reported) measures of mask and hand hygiene compliance. The investigators will attempt to include all of the above‐listed variables in the analysis. No variable selection will be performed to optimize the goodness of fit of the model. No Type I error rate adjustments will be made. Variables will be left out only if the variable contribute to instability in model estimation: e.g. collinearity (identified by variance inflation factors) or insufficient data to impute covariate status. In the model design stage, the investigators identified a full set of covariates that would satisfy the sample size recommendation that the investigators have no more than m/15 parameters in the model, where m = min(n1, n2) and n1 and n2 are the numbers in each of the response variable categories. Based on preliminary estimates of the total number of influenza outcomes expected, the investigators aimed to keep the number of estimated parameters below 25. The following variables were considered but not included in the analysis for the final model. Justification is provided. Follow‐up variables such as contact with household members with flu: noisy, lacking flu confirmation, and too reliant on self‐reporting biases. Cumulative study‐based vaccination status (i.e. ever vaccinated, never vaccinated): would be collinear with seasonal vaccine status. Absence from work: not directly related to outcome, chose to include average number of hours worked instead. Dummy variables of clinic types: while these encode important questions, they aren't the main purpose of the central study, and were characteristics that were matched on. Size of household: for parsimony, the investigators will include number of household members under 5 instead. Clinic size: was used in matching for randomization. Comorbid conditions: hard to justify including some and not others, of secondary relevance to the main outcome. Average number of hours worked per week defined each season for each individual: there was a minimum number of hours worked defined in inclusion criteria, so this range will not be substantial. Smoking status: secondary relevance to main outcome. 2.e Pre‐specified exploratory analyses In addition to the pre‐specified analyses of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will run several pre‐specified exploratory analyses to assess the impact of vaccine coverage and protocol compliance with the study outcomes. Using the models described in Sections 3 and 4 below, the investigators will consider adding additional covariates to the models from the primary and secondary analyses. Specifically, the investigators will examine the impact of covariates specific to a particular cluster‐season including: Vaccine coverage among participants in the cluster Hand‐hygiene compliance rate Measure of how often any HCW in the clinic wore any mask, MM or N95 Proportion of clinic HCW enrolled in study and size of clinic Additionally, the investigators will assess interaction terms considering the following variables: Interaction of cluster‐level mask compliance with mask group Interaction of individual‐level vaccination status with mask group Finally, the investigators will investigate combinations of cluster‐level, seasonal, individual‐level and cluster‐seasonal random effects to capture different possible correlation structures of the data. The magnitude of each variance component will dictate whether the variance components are included in the final model. 3. Analysis plan for primary outcome: laboratory‐confirmed influenza 3.a Outcome definitions A dichotomous variable will indicate whether or not a participant had an episode of laboratory‐confirmed influenza during a single influenza season. As specified in the protocol, individuals who have a PCR‐confirmed influenza infection collected within seven days of symptom onset or who have a 4‐fold rise in antibody titer will be considered as a positive case, As described above, the investigators will implement a per‐protocol analysis and an ITT analysis. 3.b Planned descriptive analysis The descriptive analysis will focus on aggregated participant numbers across the groups specified in ""respect outcome tables.xlsx"". The tables are as follows: 1) demographics, comprised of a breakout across treatment arms of characteristics including age, race, gender, occupation, clinic characteristics, vaccination status, and comorbid conditions, 2) Adjudication, where tallies of ResPECT participants are broken down into categories depending on participant's eligibility for the ITT and PP analyses and influenza adjudication outcome by year, 3) Nasopharyngeal swab lab results, where participants are broken out by year and mask type across the possible influenza and non‐influenza viruses tested during the study, and 4) Summary results of lab‐confirmed influenza, lab‐confirmed non‐influenza, ARI, LCRI, LDRI and ILI across intervention arms only. 3.c Planned Primary Analysis The investigators will use an individual‐level logistic regression model to estimate the difference in influenza infection between the N95 and medical mask groups. Let Y_ijs be an indicator of whether subject i in cluster j developed laboratory‐confirmed influenza in season s, and MASK_js is an indicator of which mask the clinic was assigned to in season s (0 if medical mask and 1 if N95). Then the investigators will fit a version of this model logit[Pr(Y_ijs=1|MASK_js)]=Beta_0+Beta_1*MASK_js+SUM_k(Theta_k*X_k,ijs+alpha_ j + alpha_i where the alpha_j are the cluster‐level random intercepts, the alpha_i are the individual‐level random intercepts (both assumed to be normally distributed), and the X_k refer to the individual‐level covariates listed in Section 2.d. Unadjusted analyses will drop individual‐level covariates and random intercepts, but will retain the cluster‐level random effects. For each fitted model, the estimated odds ratio comparing the odds of infection for those HCPs wearing N95s compared to those HCPs wearing medical masks (i.e. exp(Beta_1) will be reported, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ITT and PP will use the same model equation (shown above) but will use different subsets of participants from the full cohort as described above. 3.d Planned Sensitivity Analysis To account for the unavoidable additional uncertainty regarding the missing data from the primary outcome, the investigators will conduct a sensitivity analysis that randomly assigns binary outcomes to participants who did not complete the study. Specifically, the investigators will create a two‐dimensional grid on which the investigators vary the influenza attack rates in participants who dropped out of the study for both the medical mask (MM) and N95 arm, separately. The investigators will fix the MM dropout attack rate between half and twice the observed MM attack rate, based on complete data. The investigators will fix the N95 dropout attack rate between half and twice the observed N95 attack rate, based on complete data. By varying these two parameters across the grid, and for each combination, calculating the adjusted odds ratio (averaged across n=50 imputed datasets for each point on the grid), the investigators will observe the sensitivity of the results to values of the missing data. Additionally, the investigators will compare rates reporting of symptomatic events in the two study arms. If the investigators detect a statistically significant difference in symptomatic reporting between arms, the investigators will include a covariate adjustment of person time in each model to account for the amount of person time under observation. 4. Analysis plan for secondary outcomes 4.a Definitions of secondary outcomes: Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI): This outcome is the incidence of ARI as a clinical syndrome. ARI will be defined as the occurrence of signs or symptoms of respiratory infection, as defined by Table 2 in the published protocol with or without laboratory confirmation. Influenza‐Like Illness (ILI): This outcome is the incidence of ILI as a clinical syndrome. ILI will be defined as temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater plus cough and/or a sore throat, with or without laboratory confirmation. Laboratory Confirmed Respiratory Illness (LCRI): This outcome is defined as a laboratory confirmed respiratory illness from any of the pathogens listed in Table 4 in the protocol. Laboratory confirmed respiratory illness is ARI combined with laboratory confirmation by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) of infection with any of the pathogens listed in Table 4 in an upper respiratory specimen swab after symptoms were reported and within seven days of the original symptomatic report (PP definition of LCRI and confirmed April, 2016). Events with multiple viruses detected will count as a single event of LCRI. If a swab that tested positive but was not associated with a symptomatic event (i.e. was not collected between symptom onset and seven days after symptom onset) then the incident does not count as a LCRI event. If an individual seroconverts to influenza, had symptoms at some time during the study, and does not have a PCR‐confirmed pathogen event already, then the investigators will assign them a single LCRI event. Laboratory‐detected respiratory infection (LDRI): For a participant with or without symptoms, a laboratory‐detected infection is defined as: 1) detection of a respiratory pathogen by PCR or other laboratory methods or 2) serological evidence of infection (e.g., seroconversion) with a respiratory pathogen during the study surveillance period(s). In a case where two or more pathogens are identified in the same specimen, each pathogen will be considered to represent a separate infection (e.g., 2 pathogens as 2 events, 3 pathogens as 3 events) for that study participant for that time‐point. Sequential detection of the same pathogens by PCR or other laboratory method in swabs collected at least 21 days apart will be considered separate infections. For all of these endpoints, an individual may experience any or all of the outcomes more than once during the course of the 12‐week study. Within the same study identification (ID), participants must report being symptom‐free for at least seven days prior to the beginning of the second event, except for LDRI which has the longer 21‐day window separating events. As in the primary endpoint section, the secondary outcomes analysis will also include a per‐protocol and an ITT analysis. A general description of these approaches is provided above, with specific modifications discussed below. 4.b Planned secondary outcome ITT analysis As in the primary outcome ITT, this analysis will include all of the randomized ResPECT participants regardless of withdrawal status, participation, or protocol adherence. Secondary outcomes will be characterized using a per‐week rate of infection so that all participants may be included. The investigators will use a covariate‐adjusted individual‐level log‐linear Poisson regression analysis with person time as an offset term as well as cluster‐level and individual‐level random intercepts. For the ITT analysis, the amount of person time will be fixed at 12 weeks for each participant, regardless of how much time participant participated in the study. The investigators will include the same covariates as described in the primary outcome analysis section above in the Poisson regression model for the ITT and per‐protocol analyses. Unadjusted models will include only the cluster‐level random intercepts. For each fitted model, the estimated incidence rate ratio between the N95 and medical mask arm will be estimated and reported, with a 95% CI. 4.c Secondary outcome per‐protocol analysis Per‐protocol analyses will use the same Poisson regression methods described for the secondary outcome ITT analyses. Additionally, the per‐protocol analyses will include ResPECT study participants who completed at least 8 weeks (starting at the time of site activation) of the 12‐week trial. All randomized participants will be included unless participant withdrew, were administratively withdrawn, or deactivated before participating for at least 8 weeks. Calculation of person‐weeks for each participant will proceed as follows: for individuals who withdrew, completion date will be determined by the earliest withdrawal or deactivation date; in the event that these dates conflict, the earlier date will be used. For all other participants, active participation time will be calculated as the time between clinic activation and the latest of either the automatically‐generated timestamp of the last completed daily or weekly survey or the collection date of the last swab, up to 12 weeks. 4.d Missing covariate data for secondary outcomes The analysis approaches for the secondary outcomes will encounter instances of missing data, either in or failure to report relevant information on self‐reported forms. Areas in which these issues may require special handling are 1) missing swab collection dates, 2) missing swab results, and 3) incomplete symptomatic event reporting. Missing swab collection dates are relevant for matching swab results to symptomatic event reports. Where this data is missing (often in the case of swabs collected using take‐home kits, where participants self‐collected the nasopharyngeal (NP) samples), the investigators will attempt to match swab results to symptomatic reporting events using the swab number or process of elimination (ie, only one event was reported and only 1 symptomatic swab was provided). Missing swab results may occur due to practical considerations (running out of PCR plates), participant noncompliance, or handling errors. These results are truly missing, cannot be recovered, and therefore must be discarded. There are also a few instances (<30 out of >11,000, or <0.27%) in which results cannot be reliably matched to the correct individual due to barcode transcription errors. These will be discarded if there is any doubt about the correct assignment barcode. Since these errors did not arise in a systematic way and comprise a very small portion of the overall available and reliable swab samples, this decision should not affect the analysis outcome. A few instances also exist in which participants provided a symptomatic swab but failed to complete a symptomatic event form. Since the participant provided no details to accompany the biological specimen, the investigators will not include these data in the analysis of ILI events (which require specific symptom reports). However, positive symptomatic swab data lacking specific symptom data will be included in the ARI and LCRI."	false
0	Impact of complicated myocardial injury on the clinical outcome of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients. Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of the severe or critically ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and evaluate the impact of complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin value. Result(s): The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years. Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension, 13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%) with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8 (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01). Conclusion(s): Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Growth Rate and Acceleration Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic Reveals the Effect of Public Health Measures in Real Time. Background: Ending the COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the most prominent challenges in recent human history. Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars toward achieving that goal. Objective(s): We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Method(s): The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay), and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at https://theguarani.com.br/ or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 3,722,128 cases reported worldwide as of May 8th 2020. Result(s): We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within 1 week, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusion(s): These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.© Copyright © 2020 Utsunomiya, Utsunomiya, Torrecilha, Paulan, Milanesi and Garcia.	false
0	Consistent detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in saliva. The 2019-novel-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected in the self-collected saliva of 91.7% (11/12) of patients. Serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend. Live virus was detected in saliva by viral culture. Saliva is a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control in patients with 2019-nCoV infection.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: Prospective cohort study. AbstractObjective To understand the epidemiology and burden of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the first epidemic wave on the west coast of the United States. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. Participants 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). Main outcome measures Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (R E) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. Results As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in R E were identified over the study period within each region. Conclusions Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high. Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

0	Sequential exposure to bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine coronavirus results in increased respiratory disease lesions: clinical, immunologic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings. Bovine coronaviruses (BoCVs) have been found in respiratory tissues in cattle and frequently associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD); however, pathogenesis studies in calves are limited. To characterize the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of BoCV isolates, we used 5 different BoCV strains to inoculate colostrum-deprived calves, ~2-5wk of age. Later, to determine if dual viral infection would potentiate pathogenicity of BoCV, calves were inoculated with BoCV alone, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) alone, or a series of dual-infection (BVDV-BoCV) schemes. A negative control group was included in all studies. Clinical signs and body temperature were monitored during the study and samples collected for lymphocyte counts, virus isolation, and serology. During autopsy, gross lesions were recorded and fixed tissues collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; fresh tissues were collected for virus isolation. Results suggest increased pathogenicity for isolate BoCV OK 1776. Increased body temperature was found in all virus-inoculated groups. Lung lesions were present in calves in all dual-infection groups; however, lesions were most pronounced in calves inoculated with BVDV followed by BoCV inoculation 6d later. Lung lesions were consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of BoCV antigen. Our studies demonstrated that BVDV-BoCV dual infection may play an important role in BRD pathogenesis, and timing between infections seems critical to the severity of lesions.	false
0	Stability issues of RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020. We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak. We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic. These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false
0	Cytokine storm in COVID-19: pathogenesis and overview of anti-inflammatory agents used in treatment. COVID-19 infection has a heterogenous disease course; it may be asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in the majority of the cases, while immunologic complications such as macrophage activation syndrome also known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, resulting in cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may also occur in some patients. According to current literature, impairment of SARS-CoV-2 clearance due to genetic and viral features, lower levels of interferons, increased neutrophil extracellular traps, and increased pyroptosis and probable other unknown mechanisms create a background for severe disease course complicated by macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm. Various genetic mutations may also constitute a risk factor for severe disease course and occurrence of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Once, immunologic complications like cytokine storm occur, anti-viral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-rheumatic drugs, which are tried for managing immunologic complications of COVID-19 infection, will also be discussed including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-TNF-alpha agents, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and colchicine. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of immunologic complications will decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, which requires the collaboration of infectious disease, lung, and intensive care unit specialists with other experts such as immunologists, rheumatologists, and hematologists.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).	false
0	"Expert consensus on clinical management strategy for patients with thoracic trauma during the epidemic period of COVID-19. Since December 2019, a corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been continuing to spread throughout China. This epidemic is characterized by strong infectivity and concealment. China's domestic epidemic is gradually under control by strict quarantine and control measures, meanwhile the incidence of trauma has reduced. However, with the resumption of industry and traffic, the chest trauma caused mainly by traffic accidents and high falling has increased gradually, great risks and challenges are faced in clinical treatment. Therefore, combined with the current epidemic environment and the treatment characteristics of thoracic trauma, experts from the Thoracic Trauma Group, Thoracic Surgery Branch of China International Exchange and Promotion Association for Medical and Health Care and Chest Trauma Management Committee, Guangdong Association of Thoracic Disease develop an ""Expert consensus on clinical management strategy for patients with thoracic trauma during the epidemic period of COVID-19 pneumonia"". In order to promote the treatment of chest trauma in a scientific and orderly way, the consensus elaborated 4 parts, including classification and treatment strategy for patients with thoracic trauma required a surgical procedure, non-operative treatment of patients with thoracic trauma, management process of chest trauma, and protection and management of ward.Copyright © 2020 People's Military Medical Press.

0	Evidence and possible mechanisms of rare maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread rapidly worldwide, data remains scarce about the natural history of infection in pregnant women and the risk of mother-to-fetal transmission. Current data indicates that viral RNA levels in maternal blood are low and there is no evidence of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV- 2 can occur but is rare. Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM. However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy. Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	COVID-19 related neuroimaging findings: A signal of thromboembolic complications and a strong prognostic marker of poor patient outcome. Objective: To investigate the incidence and spectrum of neuroimaging findings and their prognostic role in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York City. Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort study of 3218 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to a major healthcare system (three hospitals) in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports. Four neuroradiologists evaluated all neuroimaging studies for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19. Result(s): 14.1% of admitted COVID-19 patients had neuroimaging and this accounted for only 5.5% of the total imaging studies. Acute stroke was the most common finding on neuro-imaging, seen in 92.5% of patients with positive neuro-imaging studies, and present in 1.1% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with acute large ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke had much higher mortality risk adjusted for age, BMI and hypertension compared to those COVID-19 patients without neuroimaging. (Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detection of an acute stroke is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome. Our study also highlights the fact there is limited use of neuroimaging in these patients due to multiple logistical constraints.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms in Hubei, China: A descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study. Objective: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. Method(s): In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. Result(s): In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD +/- 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In +/- cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. Discussion(s): We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2020 by The American College of Gastroenterology.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit in Hangzhou, China. Objective: This study summarizes and compares clinical and laboratory characteristics of 34 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China from Jan. 22 to Mar. 5, 2020. Method(s): A total of 34 patients were divided into two groups, including those who required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 11 patients. Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared. Result(s): The rates of the acute cardiac and kidney complications were higher in IMV cases than those in NIV cases. Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization Conclusion(s): Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.Copyright © 2020, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records: Chen H, Gun J, Wang C, et al. Lancet 2020; 395: 809-15. Multiple reports have been published recently on characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the general population, but there is little information on pregnancy-related presenting symptoms and outcomes. The goal of this study was to report clinical data as well as incidence of vertical transmission in pregnant patients with COVID-19. This retrospective chart review was performed on pregnant women admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China with confirmed COVID-19 between January 20 through January 31, 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records were reviewed by two investigators. Additionally, analyses from amniotic fluid, cord blood samples, and neonatal throat samples from the time of delivery were included. Vertical transmission was defined as positive testing for COVID-19 in these samples. Descriptive statistics were used. There were nine patients included in the analysis. All were in the third trimester on admission, the earliest presenting at 36 weeks, 2 days and all had a known source of exposure to COVID-19. None of the patients had baseline comorbidities, but one patient had gestational hypertension and another developed pre-eclampsia. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever on admission (78%), postpartum fever (67%), cough (44%), myalgia (33%), and sore throat (22%). Most had low or normal leukocyte count (78%) and 5 (56%) had lymphopenia. C-reactive protein was greater than 10mg/L in 75% of patients. One was found to be co-infected with influenza, and all were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and required oxygen therapy and antibiotics. Many (67%) also received antivirals. Regarding delivery, all nine were live births delivered via cesarean section with 1-min Apgar scores of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar scores of 9-10. Four of the 9 were delivered prematurely at 36 weeks (44%) for a variety of reasons including premature rupture of membranes, pre-eclampsia, or pneumonia. None of the fluid samples at birth were positive for COVID-19. Additionally, all of the mothers and babies were discharged from the hospital. Limitations discussed include the retrospective nature of data abstraction and small sample size. Additionally all patients enrolled were in the third trimester. The authors concluded that pregnant patients with COVID-19 present with similar symptoms as nonpregnant patients. Also, based on this limited sample, the mothers had a low risk of complications and all of the infants tested negative for COVID-19 after birth, suggesting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Comment: There are still many uncertainties about the disease course of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. This review is reassuring, however this is a very small sample size so caution should be used in applying these results to our day to day patients, especially those at earlier gestational ages. More studies should be conducted on pregnant patients with COVID-19 in all trimesters to have a more accurate picture of how this virus affects pregnancy-related outcomes.Copyright © 2020	false
0	[Clinical application effect of modified nasopharyngeal swab sampling for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection]. Objective: To study the clinical application effect of modified nasopharyngeal swab sampling for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection. Methods: This study covered the period from January 14 to March 1, 2020. From February 24 on, the supine position method and the protective face screen were used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sitting position method. All the patients were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, who were admitted from February 19 on, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected outside the hospital. (1) Thirty-four operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who used the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method+protective face screen group (15 males and 1 female, aged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the East District of People's Hospital of Wuhan University) who used the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years). In supine position method+protective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and face turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10degree. The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time of single sampling, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators of the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients (22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method+protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs sampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically analyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected from the above 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in the process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients by supine position method+protective face screen, i.e. negative to positive rate was statistically analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon's sign rank test, t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) The cooperation score of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method+protective face screen group was significantly higher than that in sitting position method group (Z=-4.928, P<0.01), the incidence of nausea, choking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators were significantly lower than those of sitting position method group (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P<0.01), and the operation time of single sampling was significantly longer than that of sitting position method group (t=23.17, P<0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method+protective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting position method (chi(2)=4.432, P<0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method+protective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position method (Z=-5.319, P<0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative to positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method+protective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in addition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.	false
0	Chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection: in pursuit of the scientific evidence. BACKGROUND: Chest computed tomography (CT) may be used for the diagnosis of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but clear scientific evidence is lacking. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalences of chest CT findings were calculated using a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2>=50), otherwise a fixed effects model was used., RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. Median number of COVID-19 patients per study was 124 (range 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range >76.3%-100%). 27/28 (96%) of studies had a retrospective design. Methodological quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (8 studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT findings ranged between 10.5%-63.2%., CONCLUSION: Studies on chest CT findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodological quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT findings do not exclude COVID-19, even not in symptomatic patients.

0	Towards treatment planning of COVID-19: Rationale and hypothesis for the use of multiple immunosuppressive agents: Anti-antibodies, immunoglobulins, and corticosteroids. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, can cause a potentially fatal disease, COVID-19, in humans. Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection among Returnees to Japan from Wuhan, China, 2020. In early 2020, Japan repatriated 566 nationals from China. Universal laboratory testing and 14-day monitoring of returnees detected 12 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection; initial screening results were negative for 5. Common outcomes were remaining asymptomatic (n = 4) and pneumonia (n = 6). Overall, screening performed poorly.	false
0	Neurosurgical Practice During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic: A Worldwide Survey. Background and Objective: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has consistently changed medical practice throughout specialties, regardless of their contribution in facing the disease itself. We surveyed neurosurgeons worldwide to investigate the situation they are experiencing. Method(s): A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020, by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into 3 subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data were initially elaborated using SurveyMonkey software. Country-specific data were extracted from the World Health Organization website. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.3. Result(s): Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for patients with SARS-CoV-2 (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest radiograph. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), whereas indications were modified for nonurgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). Conclusion(s): Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines. Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems. Sharing data and experiences will be of paramount importance to address the present moment and challenges in the near future.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Higher levels of IL-6 early after tocilizumab distinguish survivors from non-survivors in COVID-19 pneumonia: a possible indication for deeper targeting IL-6. INTRODUCTION: The most serious COVID-19 deriving from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes cytokine release storm and it is associated with worse outcomes. In COVID-19 patients, Interleukin (IL)-6 levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL-6 preliminary resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL-6 24-48 hours before and 12-48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were performed. RESULT(S): Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL-6 was not different at baseline (p=0.41), while 24-48h post-tocilizumab IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors [2398.5 (430.5-9372) pg/mL vs 290.5 (58.5-1305.5) pg/mL, p=0.022)]. Serum IL-6 post-tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from non-survivors (AUC 0.815 95%CI 0.63-0.99, p=0.02). CONCLUSION(S): Repeated measurement of serum level of IL-6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish non-survivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia.

0	Severe Coronavirus Infections in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVE: To inform the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, we conducted a systematic literature review of case reports of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, during pregnancy and summarized clinical presentation, course of illness, and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to April 23, 2020. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included articles reporting case-level data on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. Course of illness, indicators of severe illness, maternal health outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from included articles. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We identified 1,328 unique articles, and 1,253 articles were excluded by title and abstract review. We completed full-text review on 75, and 29 articles were excluded by full-text review. Among 46 publications reporting case-level data, eight described 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection, seven described 17 cases of SARS-CoV infection, and 31 described 98 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical presentation and course of illness ranged from asymptomatic to severe fatal disease, similar to the general population of patients. Severe morbidity and mortality among women with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and laboratory evidence of vertical transmission, were reported. CONCLUSION(S): Understanding whether pregnant women may be at risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes from severe coronavirus infections is imperative. Data from case reports of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SAR-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy are limited, but they may guide early public health actions and clinical decision-making for COVID-19 until more rigorous and systematically collected data are available. The capture of critical data is needed to better define how this infection affects pregnant women and neonates. This review was not registered with PROSPERO.	false
0	"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19): The portraits of a perfect storm. The ""novel"" coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated ""COVID-19"") is the third coronavirus outbreak emerging during the past two decades. This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the ""wrong virus"" at the ""wrong time""). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken. Everybody should be inexcusably aware that this is not a drill, and that the consequences of inadequate action will be tragedy.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

0	Hepatic consequences of COVID-19 infection. Lapping or biting?. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starting last December in China placed emphasis on liver involvement during infection. This review discusses the underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, according to recent available information, while waiting further studies. The manifestations of liver damage are usually mild (moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase activities), and generally asymptomatic. Few patients can still develop severe liver problems, and therapeutic options can be limited. Liver dysfunction may affect about one-third of the patients, with prevalence greater in men than women, and in elderly. Mechanisms of damage are complex and include direct cholangiocyte damage and other coexisting conditions such as the use of antiviral drugs, systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction. During new COVID-19 infections, liver injury may be observed. If liver involvement appears during COVID-19 infection, however, attention is required. This is particularly true if patients are older or have a pre-existing history of liver diseases. During COVID-19 infection, the onset of liver damage impairs the prognosis, and hospital stay is longer.Copyright © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine	false
0	Characterization of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 2019 novel coronavirus: implication for development of RBD protein as a viral attachment inhibitor and vaccine. The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.Copyright © 2020, CSI and USTC.	false
0	Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV. Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and cardiac disease in Northern Italy. AIMS: To compare demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes of patients with and without concomitant cardiac disease, hospitalized for COVID-19 in Brescia, Lombardy, Italy., METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population includes 99 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 4 March and 25 March 2020. Fifty-three patients with a history of cardiac disease were compared with 46 without cardiac disease. Among cardiac patients, 40% had a history of heart failure, 36% had atrial fibrillation, and 30% had coronary artery disease. Mean age was 67 +/- 12 years, and 80 (81%) patients were males. No differences were found between cardiac and non-cardiac patients except for higher values of serum creatinine, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity troponin T in cardiac patients. During hospitalization, 26% patients died, 15% developed thrombo-embolic events, 19% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6% had septic shock. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09). The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.

0	Characteristics and Outcomes of 241 Births to Women With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection at Five New York City Medical Centers. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and birth outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as community spread in New York City was detected in March 2020. METHOD(S): We performed a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who gave birth from March 13 to April 12, 2020, identified at five New York City medical centers. Demographic and clinical data from delivery hospitalization records were collected, and follow-up was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULT(S): Among this cohort (241 women), using evolving criteria for testing, 61.4% of women were asymptomatic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the time of admission. Throughout the delivery hospitalization, 26.5% of women met World Health Organization criteria for mild COVID-19, 26.1% for severe, and 5% for critical. Cesarean birth was the mode of delivery for 52.4% of women with severe and 91.7% with critical COVID-19. The singleton preterm birth rate was 14.6%. Admission to the intensive care unit was reported for 17 women (7.1%), and nine (3.7%) were intubated during their delivery hospitalization. There were no maternal deaths. Body mass index (BMI) 30 or higher was associated with COVID-19 severity (P=.001). Nearly all newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection immediately after birth (97.5%). CONCLUSION(S): During the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New York City and with evolving testing criteria, most women with laboratory-confirmed infection admitted for delivery did not have symptoms of COVID-19. Almost one third of women who were asymptomatic on admission became symptomatic during their delivery hospitalization. Obesity was associated with COVID-19 severity. Disease severity was associated with higher rates of cesarean and preterm birth.	false
0	Characteristics and Outcomes of 21 Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 in Washington State: Arentz M, Yim E, Klaff L, et al. JAMA. Published online March 19, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4326. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread from China across multiple continents and now is becoming more prevalent in the United States. The first area known to be affected has been in Kirkland, Washington. This case series reports characteristics and outcomes of these initial critical patients. Patients included in this retrospective case series were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Evergreen Hospital between February 20 and March 5, 2020, and were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Laboratory tests were included from the day of admission as well as day 5. Radiographic studies were interpreted by an intensivist and radiologist. Follow up was after 5 or more hospital days or death. Descriptive statistics were used. A total of 21 patients were included. The mean age was 70 (range 43-92) and 52% were male. Nearly all (85%) had comorbidities, the most common being chronic kidney disease (47.6%), congestive heart failure (42.9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (33.3%), and diabetes (33.3%). On presentation, 76.2% reported dyspnea, 52.4% had fever, and 47.6% had cough. Patients had symptoms for an average of 3.5 days before coming to the hospital. Notable mean laboratory values included white blood cell count of 9365/uL (range 2890-16900), creatinine of 1.45mg/dL (range 0.1-4.5), venous lactate of 1.8mmol/L (range 0.8-4.9), and procalcitonin of 1.8ng/mL (range 0.12-9.56). Three patients had an elevated troponin (>0.3ng/mL). Radiographic studies most commonly revealed bilateral reticular nodular opacities (52.4%), ground-glass opacities (47.6%), pleural effusion (28.6%), peribronchial thickening (23.8%), or focal consolidation (19%). Over two-thirds (71%) of patients required mechanical ventilation, on average within 1.5 days of admission. 57.1% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and half of intubated patients required prone positioning. Overall, most (67%) required vasopressors and one-third developed cardiomyopathy. At the time of the study conclusion, 11 (52.4%) had died, 2 (9.5%) had stabilized, and 8 (38.1%) were still critically ill on mechanical ventilation. The authors discussed limitations including small sample size and skewed population as most were elderly residents of a skilled nursing facility. Comment: This is the first report of patients in the United States with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). These critically ill patients had high rates of intubation, ARDS, and death. While most presented with dyspnea, many were afebrile and without cough. While such a small study has obvious limitations, this report underscores the importance of having high clinical suspicion for disease even if symptoms are atypical as many have rapid decline in respiratory status necessitating mechanical ventilation.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Challenges of diabetes care management in developing countries with a high incidence of COVID-19: A brief report. Background and aims: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most critical risk factors for complications and death in COVID-19 patients. The present study aims to highlight challenges in the management of diabetic patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in developing countries. Method(s): We reviewed the literature to obtain information about diabetic care during the Covid-19 crisis. We also seek opinions of clinicians working in undeveloped countries. Result(s): Current challenges faced by clinicians in the management of diabetic patients in developing countries are as follows: lack of preventive measures, inadequate number of visits, loss of the traditional method of communication with the patient, shortage of medications, impaired routine diabetic care, and absence of telehealth services. Conclusion(s): Developing countries are faced with many challenges in diabetes management due to a lack of resources.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India	false
0	Cellular Nanosponges Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity. We report cellular nanosponges as an effective medical countermeasure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two types of cellular nanosponges are made of the plasma membranes derived from human lung epithelial type II cells or human macrophages. These nanosponges display the same protein receptors, both identified and unidentified, required by SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. It is shown that, following incubation with the nanosponges, SARS-CoV-2 is neutralized and unable to infect cells. Crucially, the nanosponge platform is agnostic to viral mutations and potentially viral species, as well. As long as the target of the virus remains the identified host cell, the nanosponges will be able to neutralize the virus.	false
0	CD209L/L-SIGN and CD209/DC-SIGN act as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and are differentially expressed in lung and kidney epithelial and endothelial cells. The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry into human cells by interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we report identification of CD209L/L-SIGN and a related protein, CD209/DSIGN as alternative receptors capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed a prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelial and endothelial cells of small and medium-sized vessels, whereas CD209 was detected only in a limited number of cell types. Biochemical assays revealed that ectopically expressed CD209L and CD209 bind to S-RBD and mediate SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped virus entry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human endothelial cells endogenously express CD209L and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Soluble CD209L-Fc neutralized virus entry. Our observations show that CD209L and CD209 serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in disease-relevant cell types, including the vascular system. This may have implications for antiviral drug development.	false

0	Cardiovascular Risks in Patients with COVID-19: Potential Mechanisms and Areas of Uncertainty. Purpose of Review: COronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread at unprecedented speed and scale into a global pandemic with cardiovascular risk factors and complications emerging as important disease modifiers. We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. Recent Findings: SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. Summary: Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Cardiac Rehabilitation during quarantine in COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges for Center based programs. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, many cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services and programs are stopped. Because CR is a Class I level A recommendation with clinical benefits that are now well documented, the cessation of CR programs can lead to dramatic consequences in terms of public health. We proposed here a viewpoint of significant interest about the sudden need to develop remote home-based CR programs both in clinical research and in clinical care routine. This last decade, the literature on remote home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs has been increasing but to date only clinical research experiences have been implemented. Benefits are numerous and the relevance of this approach has obviously increased with the actual health emergency. The COVID-19 crisis, the important prevalence of smartphones and high speed internet during confinement should be viewed as an opportunity to promote a major shift in CR programs with the use of telemedicine to advance the health of a larger number of individuals with cardiac disease.

0	Cardiac injury is associated with severe outcome and death in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic impacting 213 countries/territories and more than 5,934,936 patients worldwide. Cardiac injury has been reported to occur in severe and death cases. This meta-analysis was done to summarize available findings on the association between cardiac injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 20 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. In total, 22 studies with 3684 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases=1095 and death cases=365) were included in this study. Higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (weighted mean difference (WMD) =108.86 U/L, 95% confidence interval (CI)=75.93-141.79, p<0.001) and creatine kinase-MB (WMD=2.60 U/L, 95% CI=1.32-3.88, p<0.001) were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (WMD=213.44 U/L, 95% CI=129.97-296.92, p<0.001), cardiac troponin I (WMD=26.35 pg/mL, 95% CI=14.54-38.15, p<0.001), creatine kinase (WMD=48.10 U/L, 95% CI=0.27-95.94, p = 0.049) and myoglobin (WMD=159.77 ng/mL, 95% CI=99.54-220.01, p<0.001) were associated with a significant increase in the mortality of COVID-19 infection. Cardiac injury, as assessed by serum analysis (lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase (-MB) and myoglobin), was associated with severe outcome and death from COVID-19 infection.Copyright © The European Society of Cardiology 2020.	false
0	Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 in Sweden. The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals over the age of 70 years or with underlying cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.	false
0	Broad and strong memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 in UK convalescent COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 is an ongoing global crisis in which the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics will depend critically on understanding the natural immunity to the virus, including the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. We have conducted a study of 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell responses to those of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using IFNgamma based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1. We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, and this effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a proteins. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4 + and/or CD8 + epitopes, which strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8 + T cells than spike-specific CD8 + T cells were observed. They furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + to CD4 + T cell responses. Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated with milder disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.	false

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spread to Italy with heavy consequences on public health and economics. Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad, and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding. The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies (UENPS). If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible, and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control. On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19. We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Blood circulation of soft nanomaterials is governed by dynamic remodeling of protein opsonins at nano-biointerface. Nanomaterials in the blood must mitigate the immune response to have a prolonged vascular residency in vivo. The composition of the protein corona that forms at the nano-biointerface may be directing this, however, the possible correlation of corona composition with blood residency is currently unknown. Here' we report a panel of new soft single molecule polymer nanomaterials (SMPNs) with varying circulation times in mice (t1/2beta ~ 22 to 65 h) and use proteomics to probe protein corona at the nano-biointerface to elucidate the mechanism of blood residency of nanomaterials. The composition of the protein opsonins on SMPNs is qualitatively and quantitatively dynamic with time in circulation. SMPNs that circulate longer are able to clear some of the initial surface-bound common opsonins, including immunoglobulins, complement, and coagulation proteins. This continuous remodelling of protein opsonins may be an important decisive step in directing elimination or residence of soft nanomaterials in vivo.	false

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Due to the large infection population, broad transmissibility and high mortality, it is urgent to find out the efficient and specific methods to prevent and treat COVID-19. As biological products have broadly applied in the prevention and treatment of severe epidemic diseases, they are promising in blocking novel coronavirus infection. According to the research advances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), we reviewed the potential application of biological products such as interferon, convalescent plasma, intestinal micro-ecological regulators, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, etc. , on prevention and treatment of COVID-19. May this review be helpful for conquering COVID-19 in the near future.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).	false
0	"Best practice recommendations: ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic. These best practice recommendations for ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic have been drawn up because ENT examinations and treatments are at risk of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus in certain instances. Thus, ENT specialists are among the professionals who are most exposed to this infection. During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient is ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection. According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections/aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination. For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections/aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa. ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections/aerosolizations require the so-called ""airborne"", ""contact"", and ""droplets"" additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Bacterial and fungal infections among patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We reviewed studies reporting bacterial and fungal co-infections in patients with COVID-19. The majority were retrospective studies with poor quality data biased with short follow-up and selection of patients. Septic shock was reported in 4% to 33.1% of patients. Seventy-one to 100% of patients received antibacterial treatments. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis seems to be an increasingly observed complication in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as previously reported in patients hospitalized in ICU with severe influenza. High quality prospective studies are urgently needed to verify the incidence of bacterial and fungal infections and their role on the outcome of COVID-19.	false
0	Bacteremia and Blood Culture Utilization During COVID-19 Surge in New York City. A surge of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to New York City hospitals in March 2020 led to a sharp increase blood culture utilization, which overwhelmed the capacity of automated blood culture instruments. We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia, and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than COVID-19 negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%), p < 0.001. COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded. More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection. Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during patient surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days, if necessary, to free additional capacity.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	false

0	Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in a child with nasal foreign body. While children, particularly infants, are susceptible to severe and critical COVID-19 disease, over 55% of pediatric cases are present in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children. Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viral particles remain viable for up to 3 hours, raising concern about risk to healthcare workers during aerosol generating procedures (APGs) in the airway and nasopharynx. Herein we describe the first case of a nasal foreign body in an asymptomatic child with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discuss management of this child and highlight the importance of considering asymptomatic infection and preoperative testing when planning procedures of the airway in the COVID-19 era.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"Assessment of the Angolan (CHERRT) mobile laboratory curriculum for disaster and pandemic response. Introduction: As of April 5, 2020, the World Health Organization reported over one million confirmed cases and more than 62,000 confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths affecting 204 countries/ regions. The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum Methods: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with alpha< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). Result(s): All six of the questions - 1) ""I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;"" 2) ""I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;"" 3) ""I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;"" 4)""I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;"" 5) ""I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;"" and 6) ""I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles"" - showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - ""I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;"" and ""This training was valuable"" - received high scores on the Likert scale. Conclusion(s): This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.Copyright: © 2020 Owens et al.

0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gastrointestinal endoscopic activity in France. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has strongly affected medical activity around the world. We sought to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gastrointestinal endoscopic activity in France. METHOD(S): We performed a web-based survey, including 35 questions on the responders and their endoscopic practice, from March 23rd to March 27th 2020, sent to the 3300 French gastroenterologists practicing endoscopy. RESULT(S): 694 (21%) gastrointestinal endoscopists provided analyzable data. 29.4% (204/694) were involved in the management of COVID-19 patients outside the endoscopy departments, and 98.7% (685/694) of the endoscopic procedures were canceled. 12.8% (89/694) of the gastroenterologists reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection, and a positive PCR was recorded in 12/197 (6.1%) vs. 3/497 (0.6%) patients in the high vs. low prevalence areas, p<0.0001. CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic led to a major reduction in the volume of gastrointestinal endoscopies performed in France in March 2020. The prolonged limited access to gastrointestinal endoscopy could lead to a delay in the management of patients with gastrointestinal cancers.Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.	false
0	Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Community Containment Strategies in Shenzhen, China. Importance: A new outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Wuhan, China, is spreading rapidly around the globe. Limited information on control in community settings is available. Objective(s): To detail measures enacted within a community to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 associated with implementation of the program. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This case series study details the implementation of prevention measures in a specific community setting among community-dwelling individuals exposed to or at risk of COVID-19 in Haiyu, Shenzhen, China, from January 23 to April 10, 2020. Exposures: Community containment strategies for tracking, quarantine, and management were strictly, cooperatively, and effectively implemented by a team that included a general practitioner, a community manager, and public safety bureau officials. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of locally acquired cases with indirect links to confirmed COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis with COVID-19 was confirmed when throat swab samples tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Approximately 34686 individuals live in Haiyu, including 2382 residents aged 65 years or older. Seven individuals with COVID-19 acquired outside the community (age, 20-70 years; 3 [42%] women) were moved from quarantine to a hospital for standard isolation treatment. A total of 20 people who were asymptomatic and who had had direct contact with these individuals were closely observed by health care workers at a nearby hotel. Additionally, 800 individuals considered to be at higher risk were moved from quarantine to home isolation for 14 days. There were no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 with indirect links reported in the Haiyu community from the time that the study began on January 23, 2020, to April 10, 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that cooperation among the authorities of multiple sectors allowed for the implementation of preventive measures that were associated with limited community transmission.	false
0	Adjunct Immunotherapies for the Management of Severely Ill COVID-19 Patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has infected millions, with more than 275,000 fatal cases as of May 8, 2020. Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 therapies. Most patients depend on mechanical ventilation. Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation, and passive viral neutralization not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation, both of which are limited resources.

0	Adding Colchicine to the Antiretroviral Medication - Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) in Hospitalized Patients with Non-Severe Covid-19 Pneumonia: A Structured Summary of a Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial. OBJECTIVES: Colchicine is a well-known drug, which has been used for years to treat a wide range of rheumatic and inflammatory disorders. It helps break the cycle of inflammation through diverse mechanisms including reducing Intereukin-6, Interleukin-8, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha besides controlling oxidative stress pathways which all are important and pathologic components in the clinical course and outcome of patients infected with COVID-19. This study aims to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine in non-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), double blind study with parallel group design. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 infection (RT -PCR) and lung Computed tomography scan involvement compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients are not severely hypoxic, do not need intubation or invasive oxygenation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: known hypersensitivity to colchicine; known hepatic failure; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<30 ml/min/1.73m2 (by the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) which estimates GFR based on serum creatinine. ; kidney transplant recipients, using Digoxin, QTc >450 msec. Participants will be recruited from inpatients at Labbafinejad Meidcal Center , Tehran, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A will receive the antiretroviral Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) while group B will receive Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Colchicine 1.5 mg loading then 0.5 mg twice daily orally. All patients in both groups will receive the same amounts of essential minerals, vitamins as antioxidants, and antibiotics. Patients of both groups will be treated under optimal treatment based on the CDC and WHO guidelines and national consensus proposed in Iran including the same dosages of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, antibiotics, trace elements and antioxidants while only in group-B patients Colchicine will be added on top of this protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: Time for clinical improvement and lung CT score changes 14 days after treatment. Secondary: 14 days after treatment - C-Reactive Protein test x Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio , Interleukin-6, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduction - Percentage of patients who require supplemental Oxygen - Mean hospital stay length RANDOMISATION: Patients will be allocated to each group (ratio 1:1) by using an online randomization tool: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm BLINDING (MASKING): This will be a double-blind study in which participants and those assessing the final outcomes will be blinded to group assignment.

0	ACR Statement on Safe Resumption of Routine Radiology Care During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The ACR recognizes that radiology practices are grappling with when and how to safely resume routine radiology care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, it may persist for many months. Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease. Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment; local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible because of many unknown and complex factors. However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.Copyright © 2020 American College of Radiology	false
0	A systematic review of SARS-infected pregnant females, newborns, children and adolescents. Objectives To systematically review the clinical characteristics of pregnant females, newborns, children and adolescents with SARS infection. Methods The clinical characteristics of patients with SARS infection were searched using PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data and VIP databases. Descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of the patients, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis. Results A total of 13 studies including 19 pregnant females, 14 newborns, and 81 children and adolescents were identified. The ratio of male to female was 1 to 1.2 in children and adolescents patients aged 56 days to 17.5 years. Children under 12 years old accounted for 58.3% (28/48). Of the child patients, 34.0% (16/47) had close contact with patients with SARS. Fever (93.8%, 76/81) and cough (49.4%, 40/81) were the most common symptoms in children and adolescents with SARS infection, and 17.5% (11/63) occurred with shortness of breath or dyspnea. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 9.2% (14/48), and the positive ratio of serum antibody was 92.9% (13/14). Peripheral blood lymphocyte reduction was approximately 65.7% (44/67). Approximately 70.8% (51/72) unilateral and 29.2% (21/72) bilateral lesions were found by thoracic X-ray or CT scan. No child fatalities were reported. As of maternal patients, aged 23 to 44 years, 10 cases (52.6%) were infected during early and middle pregnancy, and 9 cases (47.4%) during late pregnancy. Fever (100.0%, 19/19) and cough (78.9%, 15/19) were the main clinical symptoms, and shortness of breath/dyspnea occurred in 36.8% (7/19) of infected pregnant females. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 50.0% (8/16), whereas the positive ratio of serum antibody was 93.3% (14/15). The ratios of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and liver enzymes abnormalities were 38.9% (7/18), 61.1% (11/18) and 50.0% (3/6). All patients were identified for lesions by thoracic X-ray or CT scan examination. Seven cases were severe (36.8%). Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation (26.3%). Three patients died (15.8%). Four patients were spontaneous abortion (40.0%, 4/10). Nine patients were cesarean sectioned (75.0%, 9/12). Six fetuses (46.2%, 6/13) with fetal distress, 7 cases (53.8%, 7/13) with premature delivery were identified. Three fetuses (23.1%) had intrauterine growth retardation. None of the fourteen newborns was diagnosed as SARS infection. Conclusions The clinical symptoms such as fever and cough in children and adolescents with SARS infection are similar to that of adult patients. However, children and adolescents are usually manifested as mild infection without reported death. There is no evidence to support that SARS-CoV could transmit vertically from infected mother to their fetuses.Copyright © 2020 West China University of Medical Science. All rights reserved.	false

0	COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures. BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January. By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. METHOD(S): We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULT(S): The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time. CONCLUSION(S): The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.Copyright © International Society of Travel Medicine 2020.	false
0	A single center observational study of the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of 20 kidney transplant patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 pneumonia. The outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients who have received a kidney allograft and are being treated with immunosuppression is unclear. We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	A review of sars-cov-2 and the ongoing clinical trials. The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	A potential role for cyclophosphamide in the mitigation of acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with SARS-CoV-2. While humanity struggles to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative that effective and affordable therapeutic strategies be evolved. Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Method(s): Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Result(s): Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	A Global lmmunological Observatory to meet a time of pandemics. SARS-CoV-2 presents an unprecedented international challenge, but it will not be the last such threat. Here, we argue that the world needs to be much better prepared to rapidly detect, define and defeat future pandemics. We propose that a Global Immunological Observatory and associated developments in systems immunology, therapeutics and vaccine design should be at the heart of this enterprise.	false
0	A descriptive study of acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in Norwegian fattening pig herds. BACKGROUND: Respiratory diseases are major health concerns in the pig production sector worldwide, contributing adversely to morbidity and mortality. Over the past years there was a rise in reported incidents of respiratory disease in pigs in Norway, despite population wide freedom from Aujeszky's disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine respiratory corona virus and enzootic pneumonia. The main objective of this study was to investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in conventional Norwegian fattening pig herds. The study included 14 herds. In seven herds with reported outbreaks of acute respiratory disease, data on clinical signs was recorded and samples for laboratory examination were collected. Diagnostic protocols were compared by parallel analysis of clinically healthy pigs from seven non-outbreak herds., RESULTS: The most commonly reported clinical signs were sudden deaths and dyspnea. An average compartment morbidity of 60%, mortality of 4% and case fatality of 9% was recorded in the outbreak herds. Post-mortem examinations revealed acute lesions resembling porcine pleuropneumonia in all 28 pigs investigated from the outbreak herds and in 2 of the 24 (8%) pigs from the non-outbreak herds. Chronic lesions were recorded in another 2 pigs (8%) from the non-outbreak herds. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was isolated from lungs and/or pleura from all tested pigs (n = 28) in the outbreak herds, and from 2 out of 24 pigs (8%) in the non-outbreak herds, one pig with an acute and another pig with a chronic infection. No other significant bacterial findings were made. Seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies was detectable in all outbreak herds analyzed and in six out of seven non-outbreak herds, but the risk ratio for seroconversion of individual pigs was higher (risk ratio 2.3 [1.50- 3.43 95% CI; P < 0.001]) in the outbreak herds. All herds tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and negative for influenza A viruses on oral fluid RT-qPCR., CONCLUSION: The main etiological pathogen found during acute outbreaks of respiratory disease was A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8. All pigs from outbreak herds had typical lesions of acute porcine pleuropneumonia, and only A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was identified. Co-infections were not found to impact disease development.	false
0	Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19. A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Alhydrogel, induced high-level neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in mice after a homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Guidance for otolaryngology health care workers performing aerosol generating medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a predilection for infecting the mucosa of the upper and lower airways. Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. Recommendations: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination. Conclusion(s): By following strict infection prevention recommendations, the risk of HCWs becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients can be minimized. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly, these recommendations should serve as guidance and need to be interpreted based on local factors and availability of healthcare resources.

0	"CoviD-19: A conundrum to decipher. OBJECTIVE: Recent worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a current, ongoing life-threatening crisis, and international public health emergency. The early diagnosis and management of the disease remains a major challenge. In this review, we aim to summarize the updated epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad search of the literature was performed in ""PubMed"" ""Medline"" ""Web of Science"", ""Google Scholar"" and ""World Health Organization-WHO"" using the keywords ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19, ""SARS"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" ""Epidemiology"" ""Transmission"" ""Pathogenesis"" ""Clinical Characteristics"". We reviewed and documented the information obtained from literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULT(S): The global cases of COVID-19 as of April 2, 2020, have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness. Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from an underlying chronic medical condition like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory illness or cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-Cov-2 has emerged as a worldwide threat, currently affecting 170 countries and territories across the globe. There is still much to be understood regarding SARS-CoV-2 about its virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies; this knowledge will be essential to both manage the current pandemic and to conceive comprehensive measures to prevent such outbreaks in the future.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

0	Clinical Manifestation and Laboratory Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pregnant Women. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has become a major challenge to public health in China and other countries, considering its pathogenicity across all age groups. Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition, and is characterized by altered immunity and elevated hormone levels to actively tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, which undergoes a sudden and substantial fluctuation during the immediate postpartum period. Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and post-partum periods require further elucidation. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods. Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum. Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.Copyright © 2020, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS.	false
0	Posterior oropharyngeal saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put tremendous pressure on the healthcare system worldwide. Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHOD(S): The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULT(S): A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1-67.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8-59.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2-80.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5-74.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4-90.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3-99.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4-85.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types. CONCLUSION(S): POPS is an acceptable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Overwhelming mutations or SNPs of SARS-CoV-2: A point of caution. The morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reaching 3 Million landmark causing and a serious public health concern globally and it is enigmatic how several antiviral and antibody treatments were not effective in the different period across the globe. With the drastic increasing number of positive cases around the world WHO raised the importance in the assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic modifications that could have occurred in the SARS-CoV-2. Using all available deep sequencing data of complete genome from all over the world (NCBI repository), we identified several hundreds of point mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 all across the genome. This could be the cause for the constant change and differed virulence with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Among the 12 different countries (one sequence from each country) with complete genome sequencing data, we noted the 47 key point mutations or SNPs located along the entire genome that might have impact in the virulence and response to different antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, key viral proteins of spike glycoprotein, Nsp1, RdRp and the ORF8 region got heavily mutated within these 3 months via person-to-person passage. We also discuss what could be the possible cause of this rapid mutation in the SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine and type I interferon on in vitro fatal feline coronavirus infection. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease with a high morbidity and mortality by the FIP virus (FIPV, virulent feline coronavirus). Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed. We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-omega (IFN-omega) is effective for FIPV in vitro. A total of 100 micro M of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV. Interestingly, the combination of 100 micro M of HCQ and 104 U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-omega (rfIFN-omega, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection. Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-omega are applicable for treatment of FIP. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-omega will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHOD(S): A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULT(S): Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSION(S): The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	"Antibody Dependent Enhancement Due to Original Antigenic Sin and the Development of SARS. Human coronavirus (HCoV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections throughout the world. Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed ""original antigenic sin."" The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.© Copyright © 2020 Fierz and Walz."	false
0	Anosmia in COVID-19: Mechanisms and Significance. The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a challenge for prevention due to asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients. Anecdotal and preliminary evidence from multiple institutions shows that these patients present with a sudden onset of anosmia without rhinitis. We aim to review the pathophysiology of anosmia related to viral upper respiratory infections and the prognostic implications. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia may be a new viral syndrome specific to COVID-19 and can be mediated by intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into the olfactory neural circuitry. The clinical course of neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is yet unclear, however an extended follow up of these patients to assess for neurological sequelae including encephalitis, cerebrovascular accidents and long-term neurodegenerative risk may be indicated.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	An urgent impetus for action: safe inhalation interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission and fatality risk among people who smoke crack cocaine in the United Kingdom. Crack cocaine use is rising in the United Kingdom (UK), with smoking the primary form of administration. Provision of safe inhalation equipment for crack cocaine is prohibited under UK law. Pipes used for crack cocaine smoking are often homemade and/or in short supply, exacerbating COVID-19 transmission and respiratory risk. This is of concern, given high prevalence of respiratory health harms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among people who smoke illegal drugs. This commentary draws on scoping review and mixed method empirical evidence to argue for provision of safe crack inhalation equipment in the UK, with commensurate legal reform. Review of crack inhalation interventions illustrates the health protective and service engagement benefits of smoking equipment supply. Survey data generated with 455 people who inject drugs in London illustrate high prevalence of current crack use (66%, n=299). Qualitative accounts illustrate perceptions of relative smoking safety - alongside accounts of severe respiratory-related health harms. To date, injecting drug use has been of primary concern in relation to harm reduction initiatives. It is crucial that people who smoke illegal drugs are considered a vulnerable population in regard to COVID 19 transmission and fatality risk, with innovative harm reduction measures scaled up in response.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Amphoteric natural starch-coated polymer nanoparticles with excellent protein corona-free and targeting properties. The protein corona on nano drug carriers is an important well-known biological issue that often induces biological incompatibility and screens the targeting molecules on the surfaces of carriers, thus causing a loss of targeting specificity. Although polyethylene glycol (PEG) and zwitterionic polymers have been widely used as anti-fouling materials, there still remain critical challenges for their use as protein-corona agents for drug delivery and targeting. Here, we have designed novel amphoteric natural starch-stabilized core-shell colloidal nanoparticles with more efficient protein corona-free properties, under long term circulation, at different protein concentrations and in different protein charge environments, compared to typical anti-fouling materials such as PEG and zwitterionic polymers. More importantly, the starch-coated polymer nanoparticles can be further functionalized by antibodies to achieve additional excellent targeting and cell internalization capabilities for their use in photodynamic therapy. Our findings demonstrate a novel protein-free or anti-fouling natural material that is very promising for use as highly efficient nano drug carriers and marine coatings.	false
0	Alphacoronavirus Detection in Lungs, Liver, and Intestines of Bats from Brazil. Bats are flying mammals distributed worldwide known to host several types of Coronavirus (CoV). Since they were reported as the probable source of spillover of highly pathogenic CoV into the human population, investigating the circulation of this virus in bats around the world became of great importance. We analyzed samples from 103 bats from two distinct regions in Brazil. Coronavirus from the Alphacoronavirus genus was detected in 12 animals, 11 from Sao Jose do Rio Preto-SP region and 1 from Barreiras-BA region, resulting in a prevalence of 17.18% and 2.56% respectively. The virus was detected not only in intestines but also in lungs and liver. Phylogenetic analysis based on nsP12 genomic region suggests that the sequences group according to host family and sampling location. Studies on the circulation of these viruses in bats remain important to understand the ecology and evolutionary relationship of these pathogens.	false
0	Air Pollution and temperature are associated with increased COVID-19 incidence: a time series study. OBJECTIVES: Although the COVID-19 is known to cause by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission. METHOD(S): A retrospective study is conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26th to Feb 29th in 2020. RESULT(S): First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R2=0.13, p<0.05) and XiaoGan (R2=0.223, p<0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM2.5 and NO2 in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO2 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.329, p<0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM2.5 (R2=0.117, p<0.01) and NO2 (R2=0.015, p<0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM10 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.105, p<0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): AQI, PM2.5, NO2, and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Adults at high-risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) in Brazil. OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (>= 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age >= 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.	false
0	Care of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive Kidney Transplant Recipients. Sharing of experience amongst transplant community through various platforms and rapid publications has proven invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic (1-3). The general consensus seemed to be that most kidney transplant recipients would have a moderate or mild course, although some may progress to a more severe disease. It was recommended to stop or decrease the dose of anti-proliferative agents and continue with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and maintenance steroids (4).

0	Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children1-4. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12-31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57-82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.	false
0	Risk factors for death in 1859 subjects with COVID-19. We studied 1859 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 from seven centers in Wuhan 1651 of whom recovered and 208 died. We interrogated diverse covariates for correlations with risk of death from COVID-19. In multi-variable Cox regression analyses increased hazards of in-hospital death were associated with several admission covariates: (1) older age (HR = 1.04; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.03, 1.06 per year increase; P < 0.001); (2) smoking (HR = 1.84 [1.17, 2.92]; P = 0.009); (3) admission temperature per degreeC increase (HR = 1.32 [1.07, 1.64]; P = 0.009); (4) Log10 neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; HR = 3.30 [2.10, 5.19]; P < 0.001); (5) platelets per 10 E + 9/L decrease (HR = 0.996 [0.994, 0.998]; P = 0.001); (6) activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) per second increase (HR = 1.04 [1.02, 1.05]; P < 0.001); (7) Log10 D-dimer per mg/l increase (HR = 3.00 [2.17, 4.16]; P < 0.001); and (8) Log10 serum creatinine per mumol/L increase (HR = 4.55 [2.72, 7.62]; P < 0.001). In piecewise linear regression analyses Log10NLR the interval from >=0.4 to <=1.0 was significantly associated with an increased risk of death. Our data identify covariates associated with risk of in hospital death in persons with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.	false
0	The effect of RAS blockers on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (designated as SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic worldwide. Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. Method(s): We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission. Result(s): Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65+/-13.12 and 67.77+/-12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups. These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 and the liver: overview. On 12 March 2020, the WHO declared that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a pandemic. Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19. However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19 related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection by itself or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic medications and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 are typical of older age and/or present with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. This is also the same profile for those at increased risk for unrecognized underlying liver disease, especially nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This could make them more susceptible to liver injury from the virus, medications used in supportive management, or hypoxia. So the aim of this review was to illustrate the clinical implications of COVID-19 on the liver in healthy and diseased states as well as the implications of common liver disorders on the outcome of COVID-19.	false
0	The Coincidence of 2 Epidemics, Coccidioidomycosis and SARS-CoV-2: A Case Report. In the middle of a pandemic, patients with cough and fever are thought to have SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2). It should be remembered that in the desert southwest of the United States, we have an ongoing epidemic of coccidioidomycosis (CM). There are additionally many other respiratory illnesses that could be confused with CoV-2 or overlooked. This is a case report of CoV-2 engrafted on chronic cavitary pulmonary CM. In a time where the coronavirus pandemic is becoming rampant, we demonstrate the case of a coinfection with cavitary pulmonary CM. In this case, the importance of detection of the coronavirus and treatment of the coinfection is explored.Copyright © 2020 American Federation for Medical Research.	false
0	FDG PET/CT Findings in an Asymptomatic Case of Confirmed COVID-19. In the current and rapidly worsening pandemic, patients with COVID-19 may undergo imaging with FDG PET/CT. Because a significant proportion of infected patients may be asymptomatic, incidental discovery on a PET/CT scan performed for unrelated reasons can occur. Because of the highly infectious nature of this agent, it is important that interpreting physicians be aware of the typical imaging findings to identify potentially affected patients. We present the case of an asymptomatic patient referred for FDG PET/CT imaging of a lung nodule who demonstrated the typical CT findings of COVID-19 infection and was subsequently found to be positive on testing.	false
0	"After Less Than 2 Months, the Simulations That Drove the World to Strict Lockdown Appear to be Wrong, the Same of the Policies They Generated. Here, we review modeling predictions for Covid-19 mortality based on recent data. The Imperial College model trusted by the British Government predicted peak mortalities above 170 deaths per million in the United States, and above 215 deaths per million in Great Britain, after more than 2 months from the outbreak, and a length for the outbreak well above 4 months. These predictions drove the world to adopt harsh distancing measures and forget the concept of herd immunity. China had peak mortalities of less than 0.1 deaths per million after 40 days since first deaths, and an 80-day-long outbreak. Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, or Great Britain flattened the curve at 13.6, 28.6, 9.0, 10.6, and 13.9 deaths per million after 40, 39, 33, 44, and 39 days from first deaths, or 31, 29, 24, 38, and 29 days since the daily confirmed deaths reached 0.1 per million people, respectively. The declining curve is much slower for Italy, the Netherlands, or Great Britain than Belgium or Sweden. Opposite to Great Britain, Italy, or Belgium that enforced a complete lockdown, the Netherlands only adopted an ""intelligent"" lockdown, and Sweden did not adopt any lockdown. However, they achieved better results. Coupled to new evidence for minimal impact of Covid-19 on the healthy population, with the most part not infected even if challenged, or only mild or asymptomatic if infected, there are many good reasons to question the validity of the specific epidemiological model simulations and the policies they produced. Fewer restrictions on the healthy while better protecting the vulnerable would have been a much better option, permitting more sustainable protection of countries otherwise at risk of second waves as soon as the strict measures are lifted.

0	MicroRNA-181c potentially relieved fulminant viral hepatitis by targeting TNF-alpha. Objectives: The relationship between circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and HBV associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBVACLF) need to be further investigated. The purpose of our study was to identify the aberrant expression of miRNAs in HBV-ACLF and to investigate its potential role during the progression of HBV-ACLF. Method(s): miRNA expression profile by miRNA microarray analysis was performed on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) obtained from patients with mild chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or HBVACLF, respectively. Selected unnormal expressed miRNAs were verified in more clinical samples by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR). A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm direct target of miR-181c. mmu-miR-181c agomir was delivered by tail vein injection into mouse hepatitis virus-3(MHV-3)-infected BALB/cJ mice to evaluate its interference effect in fulminant viral hepatitis mouse model. Result(s): 7 kinds of miRNAs were down-regulated and 9 kinds of miRNAs were up-regulated in the PBMC of HBV-ACLF patients compared with that of patients with mild CHB. Among the deregulated miRNAs, the expression of Hsa-miRNA-181c was significantly down-regulated in HBV-ACLF by qRT-PCR. While serum TNF-alpha significantly increased in HBV-ACLF. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm TNF-alpha was verified as a target of miR- 181c. miR-181c significantly improved fulminant viral hepatitis mice survival rate. Conclusion(s): These data suggested that miR-181c might have potentially therapeutic potential for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis.	false
0	Asymptomatic patients as a source of COVID-19 infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterised by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe, life-threating manifestations. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation form. METHOD(S): We searched PubMed and Google (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) investigations. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analysed using random effects models. RESULT(S): In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59+/-17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14+/-26.70 years) (p value=0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases and ground glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74% by meta-analysis). CONCLUSION(S): More than half of patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities. Asymptomatic patients may be contagious and thus a potential source of transmission of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	The impact of biosensing in a pandemic outbreak: COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century. In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Itch in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: an unfolding scenario. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, that broke out in December 2019. In just four months it has spread to almost every country in the world and up to April 182 020, the virus has infected more than 2 million people. Itch is the most common symptom in dermatology and a frequent one of systemic diseases. The association of itch and viral diseases has been widely documented; however, the actual prevalence of itch in the patients suffering from new the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. In this paper, we present a review of the available literature on the topic of itch in the affected population. Moreover, we have also analysed different aspects of itch associated with COVID-19 pandemic, not directly related to the viral infection. Those included use of chemicals, hand sanitizers, common use of personal protective equipment and psychosocial stress. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Evidence from two cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: Are 14 days of isolation sufficient?. Among 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found two asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his RT-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in the asymptomatic population with an epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, those with asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means a risk of transmission, presenting a new challenge for the management of home isolation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China: Guan W, Ni Z, Hu Y, et al. N Engl J Med. 2020 Feb 28 [Online ahead of print] DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19) was originally isolated in Wuhan, China. This virus spread quickly throughout many countries in Asia and now Europe, Australia, North America, leading the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Given the rapid spread of cases, the authors sought to provide analysis of patients with COVID-19, their clinical characteristics, and severity of disease. This was a retrospective review of Chinese medical records for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported to the National Health Commission between December 11, 2019 to January 29, 2020. Electronic medical records were used to record various clinical data including exposure risk, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings. Several researchers performed chart abstraction and disagreements were made by a third reviewer. If radiologic findings were included, these were reviewed by respiratory medicine attending physicians who interpreted the findings. Incubation periods of less than 1 day were excluded. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher. Patients were categorized into severe or nonsevere based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia. The primary composite endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary outcomes included death rates from symptom onset until each component of the composite end-point. There were 7736 patients admitted at 552 sites during the study period and data were obtained on 1099 patients (14.2%). The majority were nonsevere disease (926, 84.3%). The median age was 47 years (IQR 35-58), 41.9% were female, and most were nonsmokers (85.4%). Any comorbidity was recorded in 23.7% of patients, with hypertension being the most common (15.0%). The majority of patients (72.3%) had recent contact with a Wuhan resident, although 25.9% had no reported exposure. The median incubation period was 4.0 days (IQR 2.0-7.0). Regarding symptoms, only 43.8% of patients had fever on presentation but 88.7% developed fever during hospitalization. Besides fever, the most common symptoms overall were cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.7%), and shortness of breath (18.7%). Chest radiograph findings were available for 274 patients, with the majority being abnormal (59.1%). Findings included bilateral patchy shadowing (36.5%), local patchy shadowing (28.1%), ground-glass opacity (20.1%), and interstitial abnormality (4.4%). Chest CT results were available on 975 patients. The majority (86.2%) were abnormal and consisted of ground-glass opacity (56.4%), bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%), local patchy shadowing (41.9%), and interstitial abnormalities (14.7%). Laboratory testing was available on most, depending on the test, and showed a median white blood cell count of 4700/mm3 (IQR 3500-6000), elevated C-reactive protein (>10mg/L in 60.7%), and normal procalcitonin (<0.5ng/mL in 94.5%). Other notable laboratory abnormalities included elevated D-dimer (> 0.5mg/L in 46.4%) and elevated LDH (>250U/L in 41%). The most common complications were pneumonia (91.1%) followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (3.4%) and most common treatments were intravenous antibiotics (58.0%), oxygen therapy (41.3%), and oseltamivir (35.8%). Systemic glucocorticoids and immune globulin were less common therapies, and mechanical ventilation was needed in only 6.1%. At the conclusion of the study, 15 (1.4%) of patients had died and 55 (5.0%) had been discharged fro the hospital. The majority of the remaining patients were still hospitalized. Regarding the composite endpoint, there were 67 patients (6.1%) with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death, leading to a cumulative risk of 3.6%. This percentage increased if you were designated as severe disease; in this case 24.9% had the composite outcome, leading to a cumulative risk of 20.6%. The authors concluded that presenting symptoms and workup can be variable, with many patients being afebrile and having normal radiologic studies. Several limitations were noted including missing data for many on incubation periods. Additionally the majority of the patients were still hospitalized at the end of the study and therefore outcomes could not be provided for those patients. Comment: While this study provides helpful clinical information to assist emergency physicians in identifying potential COVID-19 patients, we must understand the limitations. Most significantly, this was only a very small portion of the overall sample size of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Additionally, be cautious in directly applying these results to patients in the United States as populations may differ.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Incorporating issues of Elderly Loneliness into the COVID-19 Public Health Response. As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the COVID-19 outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations. Loneliness is already a chief public health concern that is being made worse by COVID-19. Agencies should recognize the prevalence of loneliness amongst elderly populations and the impacts that their interventions have on loneliness. This letter describes several ways that loneliness can be addressed to build resilience for elderly populations as part of public health response to COVID-19.	false
0	Letter to the Editor: Three cases of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in recovered COVID-19 patients with antibodies. The number of hospitalized cases has declined significantly in Wuhan. However, there have been reports that several cases of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in recovered COVID-19 patients, the potential reasons of re-detectable positive patients remained elusive. Here, we report three confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose IgM was negative and IgG was positive before the first discharge, while nasopharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned positive again during hotel isolation. In addition, all three cases presented negative results for IgM antibodies and positive results for IgG antibodies during re-admission period. These cases suggested that the reasons for re-detectable positive patients with profile of antibodies may be related to several factors. It is necessary to quarantine COVID-19 patients for 14 days after discharge, and the role of antibodies in anti-SARS-CoV-2 warrants further investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Exploring the young demographic profile of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong: Evidence from migration and travel history data. This paper investigates the profile of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, highlighting the unique age structure of confirmed cases compared to other territories. While the majority of cases in most territories around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated among younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group. This is despite the population's rapidly aging structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong's high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with community action and targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the territory. Recent research has highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates. The experience in Hong Kong shows that while an older population age structure may be important for understanding COVID-19 fatality, it is not a given. From a social science perspective at least, there is 'no easy answer' to why one area should experience COVID-19 differently from another.	false
0	Prevalence of comorbidities and their association with mortality in patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. AIMS: COVID-19 is a global pandemic that as of the 4th May has registered over 3 585 711 confirmed cases and 248 780 deaths. This review aims to estimate the prevalence of both cardiometabolic and other co-morbidities in patients with COVID-19 infection, and to estimate the increased risk of severity and mortality in people with co-morbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, Scopus and the World Health Organisation (WHO) website for Global research on COVID-19 were searched from January 2019 up to April 23, 2020. Study inclusion was restricted to English language publications, original articles that reported prevalence of co-morbidities in individuals with COVID-19 disease, and case-series >10 patients. 18 studies were selected for inclusion. Data were analysed using random effects meta-analysis models. RESULT(S): Eighteen studies with a total of 14 558 individuals were identified. The pooled prevalence for co-morbidities in patients with COVID-19 disease was 22.9% (95% CI: 15.8 to 29.9) for hypertension; 11.5% (9.7 to 13.4) for diabetes; and 9.7% (6.8 to 12.6) for cardiovascular disease (CVD). For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease, and cancer, the pooled prevalences were all less than 4%. With the exception of cerebrovascular disease, all other co-morbidities had a significantly increased risk for having severe COVID-19. In addition, the risk of mortality was significantly increased in individuals with CVD, COPD, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. CONCLUSION(S): In individuals with COVID-19, the presence of co-morbidities (both cardiometabolic and other) is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. These findings have important implications for the public health with regards to risk stratification and future planning. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Chest-CT findings of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing malignancies; a pictorial review. As of April 17th, 2020, more than 2,190,010 COVID-19 cases with 147,010 deaths have been recorded worldwide. It has been suggested that a high mortality rate occurs in patients with severe disease and is associated with advanced age and underlying comorbidities, such as malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate chest CT features in patients with malignancy and concomitant COVID-19 infection. In fact, the imaging findings can be challenging and have not yet been fully understood in this setting. In this manuscript, we go over imaging findings in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 and known cancer. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, in at-risk and vulnerable populations such as patients with known malignancies, infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be included in the differential considerations even with atypical image pictures. Detection of superimposed infection in patients with cancers who present with pulmonary infiltrations warrant correlation with clinical picture, contact history, and RT-PCR confirmatory testing.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Comprehensive Review of Etiology, Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Ongoing Clinical Trials. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease outbreak started in China in late December 2019 and quickly spread to the rest of the world, resulting in a pandemic. The incidence of cases is increasing every day, affecting millions of people around the globe and resulting in a public health emergency. Furthermore, disease management has been challenging for the clinicians and other medical personnel in terms of treatment options and availability of personal protective equipment. The off-label use of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and emergency use authorization of remdesivir can hopefully help the clinicians while treating critically ill patients. The use of convalescent serum has also shown some interim benefit until a definitive treatment and preventive options are uncovered, such as vaccines and other effective treatment regimens.	false
0	Management of Pearly Penile Papules: A Review of the Literature. Pearly penile papules (PPPs) are benign, dome-shaped lesions found around the corona of the penis. Despite being asymptomatic and benign in nature, the appearance of PPPs may cause a great deal of psychological distress to both the patient and their sexual partner. While patient reassurance may be the first-line treatment, several other treatment modalities including cryotherapy, electrodessication and curettage, and laser therapy have all been used to treat PPPs in order to achieve a cosmetic outcome that satisfies the patient. Based on the evaluation of the existing literature, ablative laser therapies offer satisfactory cosmetic outcomes with good long-term results.	false
0	Care of newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 infection; a review of existing evidence. Background: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is already wreaking havoc on families and communities' welfare. It is critical to discuss newborn care of infected mothers with COVID-19 based on the latest international guidelines and national guidelines of countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases. Objective(s): We discuss how to care for a newborn of a suspected or infected mother with COVID-19 using existing evidence. Method(s): As of 16 April 2020, we reviewed articles and guidelines related to COVID-19 in the reproductive health field, mother, and newborn health. Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health. Result(s): Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets. Conclusion(s): Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2weeks. Since the motivation and stable situation of mothers allow breastfeeding during the isolation, infected mothers should be taught about breast expression skills, common breast problems, the symptoms of their baby's infection, and the principles of personal hygiene to protect the infant against COVID-19 infection.	false
0	Psychological intervention on COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is novel coronavirus infection in 2019. Many reports suggested that psychological intervention is playing a positive role in COVID-19 treatment, but there is no high-quality evidence to prove its effects. This paper reports the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify effectiveness of psychological intervention during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be used by 2 independent reviewers: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, WHO Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The randomised controlled trials of psychological intervention on COVID-19 will be searched in the databases by 2 researchers independently. Clinical recovery time and effective rate will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Changes of patients physical condition (1. Time until COVID-19 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratory tract specimen; 2. Time until cough reported as mild or absent; 3. Time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent; 4. Frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; 5. Frequency of requiring respiratory; 6. Incidence of severe cases; 7. Proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to ICU; 8. All-cause mortality; 9. Frequency of seriously adverse events) and changes of psychological condition (such as: SRQ-20, PHQ-9, GAD-7, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale) will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, such as effective rate, data will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated. Fixed effect model will be used for evaluating efficiency. Considering clinical heterogeneity, random effect model will be used for continuous outcomes. RESULT(S): Relevant studies will be used to evaluate whether psychological intervention is effective for COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): This study will provide reliable evidence for psychological intervention on COVID-19. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020178699.	false
0	Az elso ket sikeres, convalescens friss fagyasztott plazmaval torteno terapia hazai alkalmazasa intenziv osztalyon kezelt, kritikus allapotu, COVID-19-fertozesben szenvedo betegekben. INTRODUCTION: At present, neither specific curative treatment nor vaccines for novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are available. There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies for COVID-19 treatment especially in the case of severe and/or critically ill patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). AIM: Convalescent plasma proved to increase survival rates in other severe viral infections. Therefore, convalescent plasma could be a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): In our article, we present the first two critically ill Hungarian patients with COVID-19 infection treated with convalescent fresh frozen plasma. RESULT(S): At the time of plasma therapy both patients were on mechanical ventilation and received antiviral agents and a full scale of supportive care. Each patient received 3 x 200 mL of convalescent plasma of recently recovered donors with sufficient novel anti-coronavirus IgG titers. Subsequent to convalescent plasma infusion, oxygenization improved and inflammatory markers decreased in both individuals. As compared to pretransfusion, lymphocyte counts increased and interleukin-6 level lessened. Both patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. No severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION(S): Our experience indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes. Optimal dose and timing as well as precise assessment of clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy will need further investigation in larger, well-controlled trials. This is the first report of the successful use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection in Hungary. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(27): 1111-1121.	false
0	Body fluids may contribute to human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: Evidence and practical experience. Background: In December 2019, an unbelievable outbreak of pneumonia associated with coronavirus was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province. This virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although much effort has been spent on clarifying the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, but, very little evidence is available regarding the relationship between human body fluids and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considerable evidence from hospital in Wuhan indicates that strict rules to avoid occupational exposure to patients' body fluids in healthcare settings, particularly among every medical staff, limited person-to-person transmission of nosocomial infections by direct or indirect contact. Conclusion(s): We tried to provide important information for understanding the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 via body fluids including bronchoalveolar-lavage, saliva, blood, urine, feces, sputum, tears, and semen in order to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurrences.

0	Canine Respiratory Coronavirus: A Naturally Occurring Model of COVID-19?. Discovered in 2003 at the Royal Veterinary College, London, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a betacoronavirus of dogs and major cause of canine infectious respiratory disease complex. Generally causing mild clinical signs of persistent cough and nasal discharge, the virus is highly infectious and is most prevalent in rehoming shelters worldwide where dogs are often closely housed and infections endemic. As the world grapples with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is searching for a greater understanding of a novel virus infecting humans. Similar to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have crossed the species barrier, most likely from bats, clearly reinforcing the One Health concept. Veterinary pathologists are familiar with coronavirus infections in animals, and now more than ever this knowledge and understanding, based on many years of veterinary research, could provide valuable answers for our medical colleagues. Here I review the early research on CRCoV where seroprevalence, early immune response, and pathogenesis are some of the same key questions being asked by scientists globally during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	CONvalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 Respiratory Illness (CONCOR-1). Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS‐CoV‐2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID‐19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID‐19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections. Passive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID‐19 convalescent plasma for use is patients with severe or life‐threatening infections [2]. Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non‐neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re‐infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID‐19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load. Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID‐19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS‐CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell‐mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells. Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID‐19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID‐19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID‐19 will be established. Donor recruitment: Recovered COVID‐19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health authorities, and individual co‐investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self‐identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will be directed to a Héma‐Québec collection or Canadian Blood Services apheresis collection site in their area to donate. Criteria for donors: All donors will need to meet the criteria set forth in the Manual of donor selection criteria in use at Héma‐Québec or Canadian Blood ServicesIn addition, donors will require: ‐ Prior diagnosis of COVID‐19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 serology following infection ‐ Complete resolution of symptoms ‐ A delay of at least 14 days since resolution of COVID‐19 symptoms ‐ Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti‐HLA antibodies ‐ At least 6 days since last plasma donation ‐ Provided informed consent Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer‐generated, web‐accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained. Duration of follow‐up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3 days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted at Day 90+/‐ 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site. Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow‐up. We estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary endpoints will be available after 90‐day from last patient enrollment. Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2‐tailed test at level α = 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization. Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien‐Fleming stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well‐being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference. Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention‐to‐treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID‐19 donor).	false
0	Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 cases of COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing. Background: We did a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing which was adjacent to the west of Hubei province. Method(s): This study was conducted on 136 patients with COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing from Jan 25 to Feb 20, 2020. Data of patients included demographic, epidemiological, clinical features, chest radiographs of imported cases, local cases, second-generation cases and third-generation cases. Student's t-test was adopted for quantitative variables while Pearson Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Result(s): The median age was 47 years and common symptoms of illness were cough (50.7%), fever (47.1%) and fatigue (14.0%). The time from contact symptomatic case to illness was 7.7 days, and 88 patients (64.7%) were cluster cases, radiological evidence found bilateral lung involvement was common (57.4%).Compared with the imported cases, the local cases were significantly older, the proportion of men is lower. There was higher proportion of cluster cases in local cases. Unlike imported cases, which fever was the dominant symptom, the local cases have more cough patients, with a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. The third-generation cases have a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. Conclusion(s): We concluded the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases andsuggested to take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts.Copyright © 2020 Formosan Medical Association	false
0	[Analysis of clinical features of 29 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia]. Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia and to investigate the correlation between serum inflammatory cytokines and severity of the disease. Methods: 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.	false
0	"Prevalence of Comorbidities in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This might help showing which comorbidity might pose the patients at risk of more severe symptoms. Methods: We searched all relevant databases on April 7th, 2020 using the keywords (""novel coronavirus"" OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (comorbidities OR clinical characteristics OR epidemiologic*). We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis. Results: The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45. The most prevalent finding in the confirmed COVID-19 patients was hypertension, which was found in 1/5 of the patients (21%). Other most prevalent finding was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 11%, cerebrovascular disease in 2.4%, cardiovascular disease in 5.8%, chronic kidney disease in 3.6%, chronic liver disease in 2.9%, chronic pulmonary disease in 2.0%, malignancy in 2.7%, and smoking in 8.7% of the patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection seems to be affecting every race, sex, age, irrespective of health status. The risk of symptomatic and severe disease might be higher due to the higher age which is usually accompanied with comorbidities. However, comorbidities do not seem to be the prerequisite for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection, except hypertension."	false
0	Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019: A review. Since late December in 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 has received extensive attention for its widespread prevalence. A number of clinical workers and researchers have made great efforts to understand the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics and develop effective drugs for treatment. However, no effective drugs with antiviral effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been discovered currently. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained abundant experience in the treatment of infectious diseases for thousands of years. In this review, the authors summarized the clinical outcome, pathogensis and current application of TCM on coronavirus disease 2019. Further, we discussed the potential mechanisms and the future research directions of TCM against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Copyright © 2020 Traditional Medicine Research.

0	Prevention of pressure ulcers among individuals cared for in the prone position: lessons for the COVID-19 emergency. OBJECTIVE: Pressure ulcers (PUs) involve the destruction of skin and underlying tissue due to prolonged pressure and shear forces. These ulcers are painful and significantly reduce a person's quality of life. PUs are also expensive to manage and impact negatively on the achievement of cost-effective, efficient care delivery. METHOD(S): Prone positioning is a postural therapy that aims to enhance respiratory function through increasing oxygenation levels. In contemporary clinical practice, ventilation in the prone position is indicated for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, despite its advantages in terms of respiratory function, several studies have examined complications of prone position ventilation and have identified PUs (facial PUs as well as PUs on other weight-bearing areas of the body) as a frequent complication in patients who are already in a precarious medical situation. International data suggest that up to 57% of patients nursed in the prone position develop a PU. The aim of this clinical review is to identify and review evidence-based recommendations developed to facilitate the selection and application of preventive interventions aimed at reducing PU development in patients ventilated in the prone position. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, this review is timely as intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 require ventilation in the prone position at a level that is disproportionate to the general intensive care population. Up to 28% of patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed infection due to severe COVID-19 are cared for in the prone position. The scope of this review is limited to adult individuals only. RESULT(S): The skin assessment should be undertaken before proning and following positioning the patient back into the supine position. Although it is essential to keep the skin clean and moisturised, using pH-balanced cleansers, there is inconsistency in terms of the evidence to support the type of moisturiser. Use of positioning devices in addition to repositioning is recommended to offload pressure points on the face and body. Further, using dressings such as hydrocolloids, transparent film and silicone may be of benefit in decreasing facial skin breakdown. CONCLUSION(S): Given the importance of PU prevention in this cohort of patients, adopting a focused prevention strategy, including skin assessment and care, offloading and pressure redistribution, and dressings for prevention may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of these largely preventable wounds.	false
0	Synanthropic rodents as virus reservoirs and transmitters. This review focuses on reports of hepatitis E virus, hantavirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and arenavirus in synanthropic rodents (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, and Mus musculus) within urban environments. Despite their potential impact on human health, relatively few studies have addressed the monitoring of these viruses in rodents. Comprehensive control and preventive activities should include actions such as the elimination or reduction of rat and mouse populations, sanitary education, reduction of shelters for the animals, and restriction of the access of rodents to residences, water, and food supplies.Copyright © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

0	A systematic review of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019, it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the world. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others. There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic. This article reviews the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19, hoping it would be helpful for early prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"Coagulopathy of Coronavirus Disease 2019. OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease 2019. However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated. The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem. DESIGN: Narrative review. DATA SOURCES: Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS,"" ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""coagulopathy,"" ""thrombus,"" and ""anticoagulants."" STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSION(S): Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations."	false
0	Hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic versus cirrhotic liver: a clinico-radiological comparative analysis. Aim To compare clinico-radiological pattern of non-cirrhotic versus cirrhotic HCC and correlate them with histopathological tumor grade. Materials and methods This prospective study was carried out on 94 patients enrolled following ultrasound diagnosis of a liver mass measuring > 3 cm. Multiphasic MDCT was performed on all treatment-naive cases and 56 cases with imaging pattern consistent with unifocal HCC were selected. Background liver parenchyma was assessed on ultrasound for cirrhosis and NAFLD. Cases were categorized into cirrhotic liver (CL) and non-cirrhotic liver (NCL) groups with 26 and 30 cases, respectively, and guided biopsy of each liver mass was performed. AFP levels were compared in both groups. Serum markers for hepatitis B and C were assessed. Masses in both groups were compared for morphology, attenuation on each phase and washout time. Presence of capsule, corona enhancement, satellite nodules and portal vein invasion was noted. Results AFP level was higher in CL group. HBV serum marker was raised in both groups. Most HCCs in NCL were moderately differentiated (histopathology), larger, had well-defined margins, showed mosaic pattern of enhancement, complete capsule and delayed phase washout. Majority in CL group were poorly differentiated, smaller, had ill-defined margins, showed heterogeneous enhancement, absent capsule and portal venous phase washout. Time of washout correlated with histopathological differentiation of masses, with earlier washout indicating poorer differentiation. Conclusion HCCs in NCL have different clinico-radiological characteristics than HCCs in CL. Time of contrast washout correlates with histopathological grade of HCC. Non-cirrhotic NAFLD may require formulation of new screening guidelines for HCC.	false
0	Effect of COVID-19 on Urology Residency Training: A Nationwide Survey of Program Directors by the Society of Academic Urologists. PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has profoundly impacted residency training and education. To date, there has not been any broad assessment of urological surgery residency changes and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Society of Academic Urologists distributed a questionnaire to urology residency program directors on March 30, 2020 exploring residency programs changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics are presented. A qualitative analysis of free response questions was undertaken. A post hoc analysis of differences related to local COVID-19 incidence is described. RESULT(S): The survey was distributed to 144 residency programs with 65 responses for a 45% response rate. Reserve staffing had started in 80% of programs. Patient-contact time had decreased significantly from 4.7 to 2.1 days per week (P<0.001). Redeployment was reported by 26% of programs. Sixty percent of programs reported concern that residents will not meet case minimums due to COVID-19. Wellness activities centered on increased communication. All programs had begun to use video-conferencing and the majority planned to continue using this. Programs in states with higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, P=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19-positive patients (70% vs 40%, P=0.03) and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, P=0.02) and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability (62% vs 89%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION(S): As of April 1, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in significant changes in urology residency programs. These findings inform a rapidly changing landscape and aid in development of best practices.	false

0	Challenges in laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The recent outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread worldwide since its discovery in Wuhan city, China in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, clinical treatment, and development of vaccines, is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. The past three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus infections at the beginning of the 21st century have highlighted the importance of readily available, accurate, and rapid diagnostic technologies to contain emerging and re-emerging pandemics. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based assays performed on respiratory specimens remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging with high sensitivity and specificity as well. Even though excellent techniques are available for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 in well-equipped laboratories; critical gaps still remain in screening asymptomatic people who are in the incubation phase of the virus, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions for ending isolation. This review article aims to discuss the currently available laboratory methods and surveillance technologies available for the detection of COVID-19, their performance characteristics and highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity, and finally, propose potential solutions. We also summarize the specifications of the majority of the available commercial kits (PCR, EIA, and POC) for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	Changes in testing rates could mask the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) growth rate. Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history. Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies. Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0. Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Mental health status and its influencing factors among college students during the epidemic of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mental health status of college students during the epidemic of COVID-19 and identify the factors influencing the mental health of the students. METHOD(S): Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULT(S): The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSION(S): The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.	false

OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to report a case series of pregnant women in New York City with confirmed or presumed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. STUDY DESIGN:  Beginning March 22, 2020, all pregnant women from one large obstetrical practice in New York City were contacted regularly to inquire about symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, anosmia), or sick contacts. A running log was kept of these patients, as well as all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing. For this report, we included every patient with suspected COVID-19 infection, which was defined as at least two symptoms, or a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test. RESULT(S):  From March 22, 2020 until April 30, 2020, 757 pregnant women in our practice were evaluated and 92 had known or suspected COVID-19 (12.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.0-14.7%). Of these 92 women, 33 (36%) had positive COVID-19 test results. Only one woman required hospital admission for 5 days due to COVID-19 (1.1%, 95% CI: 0.2-5.9%). One other woman received home oxygen. No women required mechanical ventilation and there were no maternal deaths. One woman had an unexplained fetal demise at 14 weeks' gestation around the time of her COVID-19 symptoms. Twenty one of the 92 women have delivered, and all were uncomplicated. CONCLUSION(S):  Among 92 women with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, the overall morbidity was low. These preliminary results are encouraging for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY POINTS: . Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is prevalent in New York City.. . In this case series, COVID-19 in pregnant women had a very low morbidity and no mortality.. . This preliminary data is reassuring for pregnant women at risk of COVID-19..Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false

0	Persistent viral RNA positivity during recovery period of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As an emerging infectious disease, the clinical course and virological course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be further investigated. In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical course more than two months. This patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral specific antibodies were produced during recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva. In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARAS-CoV-2 from host's immune system. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected case with viral detection positive in stool but negative in nasopharyngeal samples lasts for 42 days. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly around the world. Currently, the identification of this disease is mainly conducted by using nasopharyngeal swabs[1], but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients indicates the possibility of transmission via fecal-oral route[2-4].

0	The application of Temporary Ark Hospitals in controlling COVID-19 spread: the experiences of one Temporary Ark Hospital, Wuhan, China. Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China spread worldwide, resulting in a large number of deaths. Method(s): Temporary Ark hospitals (TAH) have played an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan. Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staffs, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on. Result(s): Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment. Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals owing to aggravation of their condition. The achievement is to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in-hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients. Conclusion(s): The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan. The successful model of TAH would rapidly and effectively control the spread of COVID-19 in other cities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	The Role of Dental Professionals in Pandemic Events and Disasters Response. In the past 20 years, major public health emergencies and natural disasters such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, and the new coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19), which caused massive casualties, infections and mass panic. These could also result in complex demands of medical resources and information disposal, and a shortage of human resources in emergency response. To address the potential shortage of human resources in emergency response, Chinese dental professionals have done some useful work in these incidents. From the work, deficiencies in emergency response training and in the expansion of rescue capabilities were identified and improvements were made.	false
0	New onset of loss of smell or taste in household contacts of home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of smell or taste impairment in household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Method(s): Cross-sectional study based on ad hoc questions. Result(s): Of 214 mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients managed at home under self-isolation, 179 reported to have at least one household contact, with the total number of no study participants contacts being 296. Among 175 household contacts not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 (38.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 compatible symptoms, 39 (22.3%) had loss of smell or taste with 7 (4.0%) having loss of smell or taste in the absence of other symptoms. The prevalence of smell or taste impairment was 1.5% in patients tested negative compared to 63.0% of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Smell or taste impairment are quite common in not-tested household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. This should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during COVID-19 pandemic, and further highlights the value of loss of sense of smell and taste as a marker of infection.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	The role of the radiologist in diagnosing the covid-19 infection. Parma experiences. Summary. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that ranges from an asymptomatic or mild flulike illness to severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. Imaging might play an important role in clinical decision making by supporting rapid triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 and assessing supervening complications, such as super-added bacterial infection and thrombosis. Further studies will clarify the real impact of imaging on COVID-19 patients' management and the potential role of radiology in future outbreaks.

0	"How to Surge to Face the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak: Lessons Learned From Lombardy, Italy. Italy is fighting against one of the worst medical emergency since the 1918 Spanish Flu. Pressure on the hospitals is tremendous. As for official data on March 14th: 8372 admitted in hospitals, 1518 in intensive care units, 1441 deaths (175 more than the day before). Unfortunately, hospitals are not prepared: even where a plan for massive influx of patients is present, it usually focuses on sudden onset disaster trauma victims (the most probable case scenario), and it has not been tested, validated, or propagated to the staff. Despite this, the All Hazards Approach for management of major incidents and disasters is still valid and the ""4S"" theory (staff, stuff, structure, systems) for surge capacity can be guidance to respond to this disaster."	false
0	To mask or not to mask children to overcome COVID-19. It has been reported that asymptomatic people can transmit the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and become important sources of COVID-19. To reduce the role of asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic people in COVID-19, universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safety distance seems extremely useful. Consequently, preparing the healthy child to use face masks is strongly needed. To obtain maximal compliance, reasons for mask wearing without attempts of removing must be clearly explained. Moreover, child's will must not be forced. Conclusion(s): On the basis of clinical findings, we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives. In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons on this issue and other hygiene topics with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.What is Known:* Asymptomatic people can transmit and become important sources of COVID-19.* Asymptomatic cases are common also in pediatrics.What is New:* Universal use of face masks for success against COVID-19 seems necessary also in pediatric age when people have to go out in their everyday lives.* In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of 1,420 European Patients with mild-to-moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background: The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown. Objective(s): To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe. Method(s): Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. Result(s): 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers). The mean age of patients was 39.17+/-12.09 years. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). Fever was reported by on 45.4%. The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5+/-5.7 days. The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex. Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients. The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients. Conclusion(s): The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients. Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Coronavirus disease-2019: Is fever an adequate screening for the returning travelers?. On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

0	Convalescent plasma in Covid-19: Possible mechanisms of action. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therapeutic options including antimalarials, antivirals, and vaccines are under study. Meanwhile the current pandemic has called attention over old therapeutic tools to treat infectious diseases. Convalescent plasma (CP) constitutes the first option in the current situation, since it has been successfully used in other coronaviruses outbreaks. Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of CP and their repercussion in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including direct neutralization of the virus, control of an overactive immune system (i.e., cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, complement activation) and immunomodulation of a hypercoagulable state. All these benefits of CP are expected to be better achieved if used in non-critically hospitalized patients, in the hope of reducing morbidity and mortality.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater anticipated COVID-19 occurrence in a low prevalence area. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 +/- 3.5% and 10 +/- 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 +/- 1.6% and 6.2 +/- 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 +/- 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Children in Critical Care Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: Experience in a Spanish Hospital. OBJECTIVES: Spain has been one of the countries most severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019. This study aims to describe a series of children admitted to a PICU due to coronavirus disease 2019 infection. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Observational study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy. Eleven children were admitted to the PICU, with suspected coronavirus disease 2019; the polymerase chain reaction test was positive in seven. The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5-162). Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward. The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16). All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent. A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis. Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission. D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated. All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in two patients on the first day of PICU admission. Two children required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Tocilizumab was applied in two intubated children. Also, four children received heparin. No patients died. CONCLUSION(S): On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old. Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission. These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.	false
0	Prehabilitation May Help Mitigate an Increase in COVID-19 Peripandemic Surgical Morbidity and Mortality. As physicians specializing in rehabilitation medicine consider sequelae from the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in 2019, one issue that should be top of mind is the physiologic effect that large-scale social distancing had on the health of patients in general but, more specifically, on preoperative patients who had their surgeries delayed or will have newly scheduled procedures during the peripandemic period. Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection. Therefore, now is the time to consider for patients awaiting surgery a wider adoption of prehabilitation-physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.	false
0	Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID-19 Mass Testing. Fast and widespread diagnosis is crucial to fighting against the outbreak of COVID-19. This work surveys the landscape of available and emerging biosensor technologies for COVID-19 testing. Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used in most clinical laboratories. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed testing capacity and motivated the development of fast point-of-care tests and the adoption of isothermal DNA amplification. Antigenic and serological rapid tests based on lateral-flow immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity. Advanced digital systems enhance performance at the expense of speed and the need for large equipment. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral-flow assays. DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study. Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. Method(s): We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9.8-51.9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10-50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Finding(s): Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9.8-18.5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39.3-51.9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9.8-44.7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8.3-38.6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18-23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. Interpretation(s): Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

0	The COVID-19 infection: lessons from the Italian experience. The first case of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in China on 17 November 2019. By the end of March 2020, the rapid global spread of infection affected over 1 million people. Italy is one of the countries most impacted, with over 100,000 positive cases identified. The first detected cases were reported on 21 February 2020 in two Italian towns: Vo' Euganeo in the Province of Padua, Veneto region, and Codogno, in the Province of Lodi, Lombardy. In the next weeks the epidemic spread quickly across the country but mainly in the north of Italy. The two regions: Veneto and Lombardy, implemented different strategies to control the viral spread. In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated. We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact. We strongly recommend that decision-makers:ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts;maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services;rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples;equip the population with protective masks.	false
0	Amid COVID-19: The importance of developing an positive adverse drug reaction (ADR) and medical device incident (MDI) reporting culture for Global Health and public safety. Amid COVID-19 Crisis, reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medical device incidents (MDIs) to Health Canada or health authorities in every country is crucial for monitoring medication safety and improving public health. Health Canada, for example, through their online database, has facilitated the process of reporting side effects relating to drugs and medical devices. However, several patients and health care professionals still fail to voluntarily report adverse events. For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, apathy, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an ADR. In the current COVID-19 Crisis, it is especially important for health care providers to be diligent about reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), since misinformation propagated by the media is causing patients to misuse certain medications. We need to shift the current thought process about ADR reporting in order to encourage a positive reporting culture by patients and health care providers.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Hazardous Postoperative Outcomes of Unexpected COVID-19 Infected Patients: A Call for Global Consideration of Sampling all Asymptomatic Patients Before Surgical Treatment. BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in China and eventually declared as a pandemic as the virus spread globally. Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients. We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHOD(S): This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020. All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion. RESULT(S): Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period. Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.	false
0	Acute heart failure in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the context of global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Background: Cardiac injury and myocarditis have been described in adults with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Method(s): Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Result(s): Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion(s): Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.	false
0	"Treatment options in people with COVID19: Selecting the best armamentarium against the novel virus. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is a global pandemic, of high infectivity, variable mortality, with currently no established treatment. This review summarizes different molecules which are being evaluated for COVID19 treatment. PubMed and Medline, search for articles published to March 2020 was done using terms ""COVID19"" OR ""corona-virus 2019"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" or ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"" AND ""treatment"". As of today, we have >350 RCTs happening with different agents. COVID19 treatment agents can be broadly classified into immuno-modulators (prevent hyperimmune-activation and cytokine storm) and anti-viral therapies (prevent virus entry, replication or viricidal). Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Interferon-l, glucocorticoids, interleukin antagonists, Ulinastatin, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis are main immunomodulators showing initial positive outcomes. Umifenovir. Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Ribavirin, remdesivir and Ravipiravir are some of the major antiviral agents showing initial encouraging results. It may be concluded that the most successful regimen is going to be multi-drug therapy, a combination of immunomodulatory agent with anti-viral agent."	false
0	Endocrine vigilance in COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for a pandemic that emerged in December 2019. Heterogeneous clinical forms are described from asymptomatic to severe hypoxaemic acute respiratory syndrome with multisystem organ failure. The impact of this coronavirus disease 2019 on the endocrine glands remains unknown. However, the results of previous studies on viruses from the same family allow us to write proposals for patients followed for chronic endocrine diseases. Currently, if these subjects are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they must not stop their treatment. In some cases, hormone replacement doses have to be increased. In case of worsening clinical signs, hormonal biological monitoring must be done. This article will be helpful for improving the management of chronic endocrine diseases that could affect thyroid, adrenals, gonads and pituitary gland functions. Proposals could be applied in COVID-19 infected subjects or in those who have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.	false
0	Immune cell profiling of COVID-19 patients in the recovery stage by single-cell sequencing. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has recently affected over 1,200,000 people and killed more than 60,000. The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1beta+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naive B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1beta and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Acute ophthalmic artery occlusion in a COVID-19 patient on apixaban. We report a case of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) in a young patient with COVID-19 infection that was on therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 micro g/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 micro g/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 micro g/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 micro g/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 micro g/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in COVID-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to COVID-19 Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in COVID-19 remain unclear.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	Diagnosis and management of the drug hypersensitivity reactions in Coronavirus disease 19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection caused by a novel human coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, leads to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Given the huge influence caused by the overwhelming COVID-19 pandemic affecting over three million people worldwide, a wide spectrum of drugs is considered for the treatment in the concept of repurposing and off-label use. There is no knowledge about the diagnosis and clinical management of the drug hypersensitivity reactions that can potentially occur during the disease. This review brings togetherall the published information about the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity reactions due to current and candidate off-label drugs andhighlights relevant recommendations. Furthermore, it gathers all the dermatologic manifestations reported during the disease for guiding the clinicians to establish a better differential diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactionsin the course of the disease.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in a Preterm Pregnant Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: Data suggest that pregnant women are not at elevated risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or developing severe disease compared with nonpregnant patients. However, management of pregnant patients who are critically ill with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is complicated by physiologic changes and other pregnancy considerations and requires balancing maternal and fetal well-being. CASE: We report the case of a patient at 28 weeks of gestation with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 infection, whose deteriorating respiratory condition prompted delivery. Our patient's oxygenation and respiratory mechanics improved within hours of delivery, though she required prolonged mechanical ventilation until postpartum day 10. Neonatal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were negative. CONCLUSION(S): We describe our multidisciplinary management of a preterm pregnant patient with ARDS from COVID-19 infection and her neonate.	false
0	Trends and prediction in daily incidence of novel coronavirus infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City: An application of Farr's law. Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr's law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr's law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Method(s): We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr's law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Result(s): We observed 50,995 (37,001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusion(s): This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.Copyright © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.	false
0	Current and emerging therapeutics for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: Relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can lead to immobility and bulbar weakness. This, in addition to the older age of onset and the higher rate of hospitalization compared to multiple sclerosis, makes this patient group a potential target for complicated COVID-19 infection. Moreover, many of the commonly used preventive therapies for NMOSD are cell-depleting immunouppsressants with increased risk of viral and bacterial infections. The emergence of several new NMOSD therapeutics, including immune-modulating agents, concurrently with the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic call for careful therapeutic planning and add to the complexity of NMOSD management. Altering the common therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the pandemic may be necessary to balance both efficacy and safety of treatment. Selection of preventive therapy should take in consideration the viral exposure risk related to the route and frequency of administration and, most importantly, the immunological properties of each therapeutic agent and its potential impact on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity of infection. The impact of the therapeutic agent on the immune response against the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered in the clinical decision-making. In this review, we will discuss the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the potential impact of the current and emerging NMOSD therapeutics on infection risk, infection severity, and future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We propose a therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the COVID-19 pandemic based on analysis of the mechanism of action, route of administration, and side effect profile of each therapeutic agent.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Among Residents and Staff Members of an Independent and Assisted Living Community for Older Adults - Seattle, Washington, 2020. In the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area, where the first case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the United States was reported (1), a community-level outbreak is ongoing with evidence of rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality among older adults in long-term care skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (2,3). However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described. During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle & King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility. On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results. The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved. A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later. This resident was asymptomatic on both days. Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting. When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.	false

0	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: Responding to a rapidly evolving situation. As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women. The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask. As the situation with COVID-19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date.Copyright © 2020 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.	false
0	Impact of low dose tocilizumab on mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia. Background: Pneumonia with respiratory failure represents the main cause of death in COVID-19, where hyper inflammation plays an important role in lung damage. This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients' mortality. Method(s): 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate >= 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <= 93% or PaO2/FiO2<=300 mmHg. Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls. On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care. Result(s): Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered. The respiratory function resulted improved in 64.8% of the observations in tocilizumab patients who were still hospitalized, whereas 100% of controls worsened and needed mechanical ventilation. No infections were reported. Conclusion(s): Tocilizumab results to have a positive impact if used early during Covid-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory syndrome in terms of increased survival and favorable clinical course.Copyright © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine	false
0	An infant with a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection detected only by anal swabs: a case report. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly worldwide. We present a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a baby with non-productive cough and normal chest computed tomography, in whom only anal swabs tested positive by real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. She was given atomization inhalation therapy with recombinant human interferon alfa-1b for 10 days. Her anal swabs remained positive for eight days, whereas her throat swabs were persistently negative by real-time PCR testing. Mild and asymptomatic cases, especially in children, might present with PCR negative pharyngeal/nasal swabs and PCR positive anal swabs. Those patients are potential sources of infection via fecal-oral transmission for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"Atypical Presentation of COVID-19 Incidentally Detected at 18F-FDG PET/CT in an Asymptomatic Oncological Patient. The incidence of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly growing worldwide. In this pandemic period, the chance of incidental pulmonary findings suggestive of COVID-19 at F-FDG PET/CT in asymptomatic oncological patients is not negligible. To suspect COVID-19 is more demanding whether its presentation is atypical. We describe the incidental PET/CT detection of an F-FDG-avid isolated centrilobular pulmonary consolidation in an asymptomatic lymphoma patient, which later resulted in an unexpected and atypical COVID-19 presentation. The nuclear medicine physicians should be prepared to suspect COVID-19 even in asymptomatic patients presenting with a ""far-from-COVID-19"" finding at PET/CT."	false
0	Expert consensus on neurosurgical department during the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019. In 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in China. The strictest prevention and control measures had been performed because of its high infectivity and mortality rate. Although the number of confirmed cases has decreased, it has not been eliminated. Neurosurgical doctors and nurses are facing the dual pressure resulting from the prevention and control of neurosurgical disease and novel coronavirus infection. Faced with the severe situation, we should standardize the methods of medical treatment and nursing process, so as to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection among patients and their families in the hospital, and the occupational exposure of medical workers. We wrote the consensus in conjunction with Neural Intensive Nursing and Rehabilitation Group and Cerebral Protection in Cardiac Intensive Care Group, which is belonging to Neural Regeneration and Repair Committee of Chinese Association of Research Hospitals, and also including Nursing and Rehabilitation Group, which is belonging to Health Management Professional Committee Cell Biology Society of Liaoning Province. We referred to domestic and foreign research results and threw out suggestions for patient's receiving, prevention and control guidance, perioperative nursing, ward disinfection to provide reference for neurosurgical personnel, patients and their families.Copyright © 2020 People's Military Medical Press.

0	Periodontal pockets: A potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2?. Periodontal pockets are the major clinical manifestation of Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory oral disease affecting the teeth-supporting tissues and has high prevalence in the adult population. Periodontal pockets are ideal environments for subgingival bacterial biofilms, that interact with the supragingival oral cavity, mucosal tissues of the pocket and a peripheral circulatory system. Periodontal pockets have been found to harbor viral species such as the Herpes simplex viruses' family. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 has gained major interest of the scientific/medical community as it caused a global pandemic (Covid-19) and paralyzed the globe with high figures of infected people worldwide. This virus behavior is still partially understood, and by analyzing some of its features we hypothesized that periodontal pocket could be a favorable anatomical niche for the virus and thus acting as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for neurologists. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally. Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed. They become silent contagious sources or 'virus spreaders'. In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID-19. It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Mental health burden for the public affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China: Who will be the high-risk group?. In December, 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly to other parts of China and around the world. We aimed to identify high-risk groups whose mental health conditions were vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected from 7,236 self-selected participants measured by anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. People aged < 35 years reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms than people aged >= 35 years. Healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep compared to other occupations. Healthcare workers/younger people who spent a high level of time (>= 3 hours/day) had a particular higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than in those who spent less time (< 1 hours/day and 1-2 hours/day) on the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers and younger people were at an especially high-risk of displaying psychological impact when they spent too much time thinking about the outbreak. Continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences for high-risk population should become routine as part of targeted interventions during times of crisis.I.	false
0	Preliminary Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Italian Liver Transplant Programs. Liver Transplant Programs in Italy have faced a sequela of management and clinical decision-making problems due to the high incidence in some regions of the country of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Italian Society for Organ Transplantation (SITO) and the Board of Liver Transplant Program Directors issued a survey to assess the initial impact of this pandemic event on the routine activity of 22 Italian Liver Transplant Programs. One hundred percent of participants completed the survey within a few days. The analysis is presented dividing the centers in two macro-areas: north-central Italy and south-central Italy. The reason for this is that the two areas had a different incidence of the infection and because they have distinctive rates of cadaveric donation. Overall, all centers remained open although a reduction in the activity was noted. Transplant Programs reduced their outpatient activity both in terms of pre-transplant evaluation (68% of the centers) and transplant recipient follow-up (100%); a reduction in transplant activity was observed in the first two weeks of March only in the north-central macro area (23 LTs vs 39 in 2018 and 60 in 2019); overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered for 24 liver transplant recipients and 37 health care providers in liver transplant units. In the perspective of the increasing magnitude of the epidemic, more data will be required to define appropriate strategies for the increasingly complex management of liver transplant patients.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk Covid-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to the Pandemic Crisis. More than 1.6 million Americans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and >10 times that number carry antibodies to it. High-risk patients presenting with progressing symptomatic disease have only hospitalization treatment with its high mortality. An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed. Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin. Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials have been registered in outpatients. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and outpatient trials results are not expected until September. Early outpatient illness is very different than later hospitalized florid disease and the treatments differ. Evidence about use of hydroxychloroquine alone, or of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin in inpatients, is irrelevant concerning efficacy of the pair in early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 older adults with multicomorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications 47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is <20%, 9/100,000 users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now dying each week. These medications need to be widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Glycosylated hemoglobin is associated with systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Background: Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, inflammation, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients has not been explored. Method(s): This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. Result(s): A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in 2019 novel coronavirus: A meta-analysis. Background: Since December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been discovered in Wuhan. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, which is a great public health issue leading to immunity inhibition and an increased incidence of infections, has been increasing over the past ten years. The aim of this research was to systematically assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among 2019-nCoV. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Medline for observational studies up to February 25, 2020. A random effects model or fixed-effects model was applied to evaluate the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Finding(s): In total, nine papers met the eligibility criteria. The pooled prevalence of DM was 9% (95% CI 6%-12%). There was obvious heterogeneity (I2 65%, p = 0.004) in the prevalence of DM in these studies. The prevalence of DM in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV was 7% (95% CI 4%-10%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was 17% (95% CI 13%-21%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was significantly higher than that in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.64). Interpretation(s): To our knowledge, this work is the first report showing the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with 2019-nCoV, which is beneficial to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV in the future.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Identification of SARS-CoV RBD-targeting monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactive or neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 cases are growing globally, calling for developing effective therapeutics to control the current pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor. Our study provides an alternative approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection using anti-SARS-CoV nAbs.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients. Background: There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. Result(s): Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n = 34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p = 0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity (p = 0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p = 0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. Conclusion(s): Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid clearance and influence IgG antibody production.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false

0	"Selecting coronavirus disease 2019 patients with negligible risk of progression: early experience from non-hospital isolation facility in Korea. Background/Aims: As the novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) outbreak progresses rapidly, staying home is recommended for suspected patients; however, the safety of this recommendation is uncertain. In Korea, non-hospital facilities called ""living and treatment centers (LTCs)"" have been established since 5 March 2020. The LTCs provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the safety of selection criteria for low-risk groups. Method(s): Between 5 March and 9 April 2020, patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria were admitted to the LTC; alert, age below 65 years old, no underlying disease or well-controlled underlying disease, body temperature below 38.0degreeC, whether taking antipyretics or not, and no dyspnea. Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened. Result(s): A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5). Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation. During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization. Conclusion(s): The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis. LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds."	false
0	Investigation and analysis on characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 associated with exposure in a department store in Tianjin. Objective: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 cases reported in Baodi district of Tianjin as of 18 February, 2020, which might be associated with the exposure in a local department store, and provide suggestions for prevention and control strategy development. Method(s): The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19 (47.50%) were customers and 15 (37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. Conclusion(s): This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store. By now, the current prevention and control measures have achieved satisfied effects.	false
0	COVID-19 Special Column: Principles Behind the Technology for Detecting SARS-CoV-2, the Cause of COVID-19. Nationwide shortages of tests that detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to significantly relax regulations regarding COVID-19 diagnostic testing. To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection. In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai'i (UHP Hawai'i).	false
0	Antiviral efficacies of FDA-approved drugs against SARS-COV-2 infection in ferrets. Due to the urgent need of a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, a number of FDA-approved/repurposed drugs have been suggested as antiviral candidates at clinics, without sufficient information. Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprineimmunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect in vivo virus titers. Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems. Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies. In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model. While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi. Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection. As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.Copyright © 2020 Park et al.	false

Considering numerical simulations, this study shows that the so-called vertical social distancing health policy is ineffective to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"". Our analysis considers the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, but similar conclusions apply to other cities as well. Code implementation of the model in R-language is provided in the supplementary material."	false
0	Scientific and Standardization Committee Communication: Clinical Guidance on the Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Cardiovascular disease and, in particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The diagnosis of VTE using standardized objective testing is problematic in these patients, given the risk of infecting non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital personnel, coupled with the usual challenges of performing diagnostic testing in critically-ill patients. Early reports suggest a high incidence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe illness, that is similar to the high VTE rates observed in patients with other viral pneumonias, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 15 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 10 May 2020). Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 10 May 2020: notifications = 6,971; deaths = 98. The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.Copyright © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.	false
0	Comparison of heart failure and 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in chest CT features and clinical characteristics. Objective: To identify the characteristics including clinical features and pulmonary computed tomography (CT) features of heart failure and novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19). Method(s): This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Result(s): There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups, but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P<0.001). While the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001; 0/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . Conclusion(s): More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms. There are significant differences in chest CT features, such as enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart failure and COVID-19.	false

With the COVID-19 pandemic progressing, guidance on strategies to mitigate its devastating effects in nursing facilities (NFs) is critical to preventing additional tragic outcomes. Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.Copyright © 2020, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.	false
